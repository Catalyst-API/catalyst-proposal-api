Also, the quality validation of translation would be in charge of the community.\n\nThe platform considers 3 different kinds of users:\n\nEnglish material owner: The user that produces and owns the material; they decide how to divide it and post it and the desired languages to be translated to, according to their particular requirements. Once they receive a satisfactorily translated material, they award ADA rewards to the translator user.\n\nBilingual/Multilingual Translator: This user selects the available materials to be translated, based on their specific languages knowledge. Once they translate satisfactorily, they receive ADA rewards, these rewards can grow the more the users participate as translators and according to their evaluations received by the Learner user.\n\nLearner: The user that consumes and evaluates the quality of translations.\n\nHow is gamification suitable\n\nBabelada will possess an algorithm to calculate rewards according to translator collaboration history and their evaluations, as well as material length and language required. Material owners will transfer ADA as a reward, and Translators will receive their rewards securely and transparently. This feature will be developed using Cardano Wallet Backend API\n\nThrough this, we will incentivize collaboration of any community member, so we can increase the amount of translated resources.\n\nHow to stay and grow\n\nAfter delivering Babelada MVP, next iterations will consider new features to attract new members of the community to collaborate in delivering materials, translations and evaluations.\n\nHow are we using the funds\n\nAnalyzing and tracing the features needed for the MVP and its development and launching plan, community participating as product owners are highly encouraged to collaborate with us at this stage of the project | $2,795 | Month 1\n\nDesigning the user interface to warrant that 3 user roles have an adequate experience | $3,796 | Months 1-2\n\nGenerating processes and systems workflows, as well as user cases for every feature | $3,224 | Months 1-2\n\nExecuting Back-end design | $3,419 | Months 2-3\n\nImplementing and maintaining required infrastructure for development, pre-production (6 months) and operation of the MVP platform during 6 months | $6,760 | Months 2-12\n\nDeveloping, functional testing and deploying | $37,276 | Months 3-6\n\nCreating a base rewards fund to award Translator user testers for translating testing material | $2,500 | Months 5-6\n\nDocumenting | $2,730 | Months 3-6\n\nDigital Marketing | $1,000 | Months 6-12\n\nGeneral roadmap\n\nIDEAS | Month 1\n\nDESIGN | Months 1-3\n\nPRODUCTION | Months 3-6\n\nTESTING | Months 5-6\n\nLAUNCH | Month 7\n\nMARKETING | Months 6-12\n\nOPERATIONS | Months 7-12\n\nKPIs\n\nAt least 150 documents posted in Babelada for translation during 6 months of operation\n\nDocuments translated to at least 8 different languages during 6 months of operation\n\nAt least 10 English material owners users joined the platform during 6 months of operation\n\nAt least 500 Translator users joined the platform during 6 months of operation\n\nAt least 500 Learner users joined the platform during 6 months of operation\n\nThe platform will be built using open source tools and the code will be shared through Github, able to be distributed or modified, always recognizing the authors.\n\nTo fulfill the KPIs, Babelada requires to be launched after 6 months of development and testing, and also to operate during 6 months, as an MVP. After this round, the project would be able to have features updated and to extend their operations period to enhance the goals of the KPIs and to add new KPIs to evaluate quality and learning impact.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369811-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.\n\nOur business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.\n\nThis approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services\n\nCOST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.\nMATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.\nTRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?\n\nWe solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. \n\n We solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.\n\nAnother great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.\n\nThe key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.\n\nTechnical approach\n\nThe web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.\n\nFounder bios\n\nGabe Gralla is a software engineer, data scientist, and technology leader based in Boston. He most recently served as Chief Information Officer at Zero, a non-profit building COVID safety apps. Before that, he was Director of Data Engineering at Lyte, an early engineer at Moat (acquired by Oracle), and an independent consultant with clients ranging from enterprise healthcare companies to crypto startups.\n\nSam Gralla is a physics professor at the University of Arizona known for his work on black holes.

Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.\n\nThe definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.\n\nThe definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.\n\nThe definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!\n\nCampaign suitability\n\nSince our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal will support our efforts to customize Tutorchain for use with Catalyst proposals and general Entrepreneurship advice. Interacting with the Catalyst community, there is clearly a need for expert proposers to connect with newcomers, but it is relatively disorganized (mainly some scattered discord servers and channels) and mainly limited to volunteer efforts. While we are all for pro-bono, community-based work, we think that injecting a modicum of capitalism may lead to huge improvements in results. We therefore want to support an expert marketplace focused on entrepreneurship in the crypto ecosystem. The success of an expert marketplace relies on an initial critical mass of high-quality experts, good marketing to in-need learners, and good customer service to work out the kinks. We are requesting $15k to support these efforts for DLT Entrepreneurship.\n\nWhy should Catalyst voters support this project?\n\nWhile the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good \"geek out\" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.\n\nWe think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common \"lack of developer buy-in\" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.\n\nMore information\n\nWe will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824.

The video game market is bigger than music and film combined 1 yet NFTs are still in their infancy. In 2020, there were over 2 billion users in just Unity 2 and 7 million developers. In addition to the wide indie scene Unity appeals to, Unreal Engine also attracts a similar number of developers at 7.5 million according to CEO Tim Sweeny 3. Despite such a thriving ecosystem of developers and record breaking revenue from the video game industry, blockchain integration is few and far between.\n\nWhile there have been solid efforts to integrate blockchain into UE4 4 5 and Unity 6, there still remain some pain points for developers that remain to be solved. While there will inevitably be efforts to add Cardano to these ecosystems, we believe it is not a small undertaking and requires professional experience to go from creating a passable tool/plugin to creating a robust, industry-ready plugin. Professional game industry experience for what developers actually want, professional experience creating these tools, and finally extensive knowledge of the blockchain/cardano ecosystem is needed. Finally, even after hooking into these systems, we believe being able to cross communicate between in-game worlds and other platforms is a must for mass adoption.\n\nSummary of current problems:\n\nSolid attempts have been made, but no professional attempts with experience of game industry knowledge, professional game development experience, or cardano expertise have been made\nCreating a plugin is \"easy\"; creating an industry ready tool is hard\nAfter the plugin is written, it is not connected to a rich ecosystem yet\nGetting professional developers from the game industry is hard\nLacking adoption once tools are released\n\nDescribe Your Solution To The Problem (continued)\n\nWe have assembled a diverse team with a veteran advisory board with years of experience at gaming company titans such as Epic Games and Riot Games (see full list below). Paired with our team of executives from the tech industry, marketing professionals, and game development experts; we are poised to dive in and create tools/plugins for everyone in the game industry and for Cardano to find mass adoption.\n\nTo accomplish this, we have a veteran team of senior developers from the company that makes Unreal Engine as well as experience building plugins for these platforms. Their resumes speak for themselves and are highly qualified to create industry-ready plugins and are aware of the tough road ahead of making sure the tools are robust enough and easy to use for developers of all skill levels to pick up and use.\n\nIn addition to creating the plugins, they will also be plugged into the rich ecosystem of https://logosphere.io with data that can be linkable across other platforms and games or even ecosystems outside of the game itself!\n\nWe also understand there is more work to be done even after creating robust tools. Other developers and companies need to know about it! Using Chris's experience with marketing (see experience below), we will push out status updates along the way as well as market to game developers when the tools are ready - or ready to be tested in Beta. Landing with a big splash helps grow adoption. We also know the frustrations from using a tool that is no longer supported, so we plan on keeping the team on staff as long as there are updates to be made before transitioning support over to Ikigai Technologies.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n• Unreal Engine (UE4) \n\n     • Plugin\n\n     • Integration to UE Marketplace\n\n     • Wallet integration\n\n     • Fluree / Logosphere integration\n\n     • Player-to-Player marketplace tooling\n\n     • Player-to-Marketplace integration\n\n• Unity\n\n     • Plugin\n\n     • Wallet integration\n\n     • Fluree / Logosphere integration\n\n     • Player-to-Player marketplace tooling\n\n     • Player-to-Marketplace integration\n\nRelevant Experience (continued)\n\nIkigai Team:\n\nMichael Yagi: CEO of Ikigai Technologies.

SPOCRA can allocate funds to help re-locate SPOs from a jurisdiction that passed disastrous regulations. \n\nThe funds allocated to aid SPOs in the event of a regulation disaster would be held in a separate ADA wallet to appreciate over time. In the event SPOs need to tackle the risks associated with operating in a location that make it illegal to run a pool an application would be submitted to the SPOCRA board or eventually a request through a smart contract would be submitted to SPOCRA to request funding. Note: the funds allocated to disaster recovery would be solely for the purpose of holding in the event they are needed to aid SPOs in relocation and would not be used in the development of a smart contract or governance system. \n\nEducation and Research (Preparedness) Funds\n\nIn addition, funds will be used for the purpose of education and research for viable relocation options. This would include research into the laws of potential jurisdictions that SPOs can move into as well as the costs & requirements to establish residency.  Funds allocated to research would be paid to professionals that provide relocation as a service to provide this information to SPOCRA.  \n\nUnderstanding the processes of the various potential nations to relocate as efficiently as possible will be key to preparing for a disaster event such as adversarial regulations being passed into law. \n\nLegal Counsel & Defense Funds\n\nLastly, funds would also be used for lawyer fees to provide legal consultation to SPOCRA as the trade association is being established. Understanding the legal landscape and what potential laws/ regulations/ tax codes implicate for SPO businesses is still a gray area in most countries. Laws passed in the United States have a greater chance of influencing laws passed in other countries. There is not a dedicated law office proficient in matters concerning the blockchain space for SPOs that can identify potential threats and work to establish regulatory clarity & educate lawmakers so they do not create scenarios that would put SPO business owners at risk of running a stake pool operation illegally.\n\nAs a non-profit trade association for the stake pool operation industry SPOCRA must ensure we are operating according to laws and regulations pertaining to blockchain, cryptocurrency and stake pool operations. Our legal counsel provides SPOCRA with the most immediate updates concerning potential threats in the legal landscape of the blockchain space that can be accurately interpreted and disseminated to the entire SPO community.\n\nHolding a lawyer under retainer for SPOCRA provides us with legal counsel over the ambiguous laws/ regulations in the blockchain space.  This means identifying and providing clarity on novel, emerging threats to the Cardano ecosystem as events unfold, i.e., potential laws being passed that can prohibit SPOs from running their businesses in the US legally would be a major assault on the backbone of the Cardano ecosystem if the result would mean many SPOs shutting down their operations.\n\nThese legal funds would also be held and used for addressing legal matters arising for community SPOs in the event of state & federal investigations or the need for regulatory defense.  Providing legal defense could benefit the entire SPO community where such cases could have cascading effects on shaping the laws in nations and states around the world regarding running a stake pool operation. \n\n \n\nDefinition of Success:\n\nUltimately not needing to use these funds as the result of a disaster would be ideal. However, in the event a disaster does occur distributing funds to help key community SPOs recover successfully. Being prepared with the knowledge required, funds and professional help to react as quickly as possible to mitigate the disaster event assisting SPOs in relocation would mean success.\n\n3 months\n\nAcquiring professional help to acquire the information on most viable relocation possibilities and best methods to make this happen quickly. \n\n6 months\n\nProviding educational content to the community to better prepare the SPO base in the event of adversarial regulation in specific jurisdictions. More operators preparing now with additional options for citizenship status would mean success for the entire Cardano ecosystem as this would mitigate the risk of a disaster such as many SPOs shutting down their operations. \n\n12 months\n\nEstablished emergency communication channels to aid in the relocation of SPOs in the event of adversarial regulation passed into law. Legitimate preparedness and relocation processes laid out and proven through use by community SPOs.  \n\nBudget:\n\n$40,000 - Disaster recovery - held for the purpose of providing re-location assistance to community SPOs. \n\n$20,000 - Disaster preparedness - research & education into the best relocation spots and most efficient methods. \n\n$20,000 - Disaster defense - lawyer retainer fee for legal consultation and holding of funds for future legal aid.\n\n \n\nAuditability:\n\nAll SPOCRA transactions can be viewed on Cardano blockchain explorers via searching for the public wallet address used to hold funds and create transactions.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369921-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis proposal will utilize Heidrun and Plutus smart contracts to scale out and build up the Adosia IoT profile market. The next frontier of IoT devices is blockchain integration and Cardano is the pioneer.\n\n \n\nAdosia enables users to create, define and deploy custom WiFi control systems. As of right now, users will need to create their own IoT profiles for these systems. There does not exist a decentralized means to distribute these customized IoT profiles to the masses. If there existed a peer-to-peer IoT profile marketplace then it would help accelerate the proliferation of customized IoT deployments around the world by allowing new IoT user to quickly set up their IoT devices with expert grade configurations. The goal of this proposal is to design the smart contracts required for the marketplace, build IoT smart contract integration, and provide the ability for users to monetize their IoT creations on a decentralized blockchain.\n\n \n\nHow does a P2P IoT marketplace integrate with Cardano?\n\nEvery IoT device has nearly endless configurations applicable across a broad range of industries. Each one of these configurations is a customized user-created IoT profile, limited only by the user's imagination.\n\nWhat we seek to do is to create a monetary marketplace such that these custom configurations could be sold and exchanged on Cardano. Each IoT Profile is textual information which means each configuration and/or configuration hash can be stored on the blockchain. If the information can be stored on the blockchain in an exchangeable way then it can be traded and sold between users on the chain. It will enable a global economic ecosystem around the world providing users with predefined IoT configurations for many different applications.\n\n \n\nHow do IoT devices and Cardano provide value for end-users?\n\nIoT and blockchain will be leveraged by many different industries around the world. The ability to securely and safely integrate these technologies will be an accelerant for the rapid deployment of IoT devices and Cardano adoption around the world. Micro industries of profile creation, data submission, data aggregation and data monetization will materialize allowing end-users to benefit from being able to readily access experts' amazing IoT profiles to satisfy a wide variety of custom applications and requirements.\n\n \n\nBudget Requirements\n\n \n\n - frontend development to build out the marketplace GUI ($5k)\n\n - backend development to build out the RESTful API for smart contract integration ($11k)\n\n - lean Haskell development to build out Plutus smart contracts required for the marketplace and IoT device integration ($22k)\n\n - hardware improvements + new sensors board spin (temp sensor) ($2k)\n\n \n\nThe goal is to build the P2P marketplace by the end of 2021 and a fully-fledged functional product going into the new year.\n\n \n\nDeliverables\n\n- Decentralized peer-to-peer IoT profile marketplace\n\n- IoT smart contract integration \n\n- IoT smart contract integration \n\n \n\nTarget public launch date: 12/31/2021\n\n \n\nDefinitions of success:\n\n- after 3 months the implementation plan will be complete\n\n- after 6 months all technical deliverables will have been met\n\n- after 12 months we would like to see numerous new Adosia applications utilizing the Adosia IoT p2p marketplace\n\n \n\nKyle Solomon (FROG / WOLF) is a seasoned Cardano stake pool operator, developer and community contributor, a creator of spacecoins and jetchicken, co-founder of SPOCRA and the founder of the Adosia IoT open hardware project. Quinn (LOGIC) is an extremely talented developer now working full time in the Cardano ecosystem. Quinn and Kyle are both previous Catalyst Fund recipients. All funds will be used for development.\n\n \n\nBackground:\n\nIn 2018, having produced functional hardware, Adosia attempted an ICO with the goal of building to this whitepaper:\n\nhttps://adosia.com/documents/adosia_whitepaper.pdf (new whitepaper coming soon)\n\nUpon being contacted by regulators, Adosia opted to cooperate while moving to build out the Adosia IoT platform without funding - and we managed to build something better than originally intended while preserving the goal of aligning for tokenization on Cardano\n\nAdosia is now a fully functional end-to-end utility application enabling users to create, define and deploy custom WiFi control systems - this requires the user to have minimal hardware experience and zero software development knowledge - most of our customers are using Adosia to deploy (and monitor) custom cultivation and gardening applications - though many are using it for natural gas/smoke detection, motion control, and a variety of hobby applications (motion-activated Christmas tree lights, makeshift security, etc).\n\n \n\nEnter Cardano:\n\nAdosia's ADO token / Goguen positioning predominantly entails enabling users to sell/monetize their IoT creations within a p2p marketplace via offering packages of \"IoT device operating profiles\" which other users can purchase/license to enable their own open hardware - as one example our Canadian cannabis customers can monetize their cultivation profiles via enabling other customers across the globe to purchase or license their IoT operating profile setups (\"data IP\").\n\nAdosia is working to incentivize IoT data submission of potentially useful analog data (moisture levels) and select digital data (such as temperature, humidity, etc) and work to see if that can be monetized via DMP (data marketplace) for sustained revenue post incentive phase.\n\nAdosia's Fund2 proposal, a parallel initiative, entails a core library to sign Cardano transactions locally - so an IoT device itself can perform transactions to purchase such upgrades and profiles - the architecture there would entail the user generating the build transaction server side, then the device pulling that in locally to sign, and then sending out the necessary components for the signed CBOR to be submitted to the chain via a hot cardano node - this component will enable a baseline for broad development to occur within the Arduino ecosystem as well as enable Adosia devices to complete purchases on their own behalf as well as to authenticate themselves within the system.\n\nAdosia is also working to readily modify our platform in a manner to enable any user with a Cardano wallet to trigger IoT actions simply by sending a transaction to a specific Cardano address. For each given IoT device, Adosia users would simply define the Cardano address(es) to monitor, purchase pricing, and 3 bit external IO to trigger (supporting up to 8 products ) for each relevant product item.\n\n \n\n \n\nAdosia Heidrun:\n\nHeidrun, originally created to support the Adosia IoT project (Catalyst Fund3 deliverable), is an open source platform API that enables developers a simple self-hosted means to rapidly integrate both accepting Cardano payments as well as add support for user or app initiated Cardano native asset withdrawals directly into custom applications.   Heidrun exists as a standalone node, operates completely independent of smart contracts, and is Cardano \"node-less\" (currently utilizes BlockFrost API).\n\n \n\nAdosia is currently using Heidrun to:\n\n- accept Ada payments for custom IoT triggering upon Ada payment receipt\n\n- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia SaaS subscriptions\n\n- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia IoT platform account and device upgrades wit\n\n- accept Ada payments for on-platform ADO token purchases\n\n- accept Ada payments to enable ADO token withdrawals\n\n \n\nUseful Links:\n\n \n\nAdosia Home:\n\nhttps://adosia.com\n\n \n\nAdosia Learn (check the token part!):\n\nhttps://adosia.com/faq.php\n\n \n\nAdosia Git:\n\nhttps://github.com/adosia/adosia-iot\n\n \n\nAdosia YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCozulBTa3-zuyMQMCvhGbKA\n\n \n\nAdosia IoT Store:\n\nhttps://adosia.io\n\n \n\nHeidrun presentation:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aOS7GU3C9oj7V7nUUsEr4ciact22ZgYbJXF2XWLf7Hg/edit#slide=id.ge3ac1c4ef8_0_80 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nHeidrun Github:\n\nhttps://github.com/adosia/Heidrun","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369922-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPlutus Smart Contracts are all the rage. They promise financial solutions for Social and Environmental impact (SoFi), real-world uses (RealFi) and new means of organising globally (DAOs); Solutions that bring economic identity to billions.\n\nVery few people, however, will fully understand what a Smart Contract does. They are complicated because they combine three professions: Computer Science, Finance, and Law. Programming languages codify financial mechanisms, but they cannot be read or audited by humans who are not programmers. That includes courts and arbitrators of disputes. This opaqueness and indirect relationship to intent is an opportunity for phishing attacks, bait and switch scams, and outright fraud.\n\nTeam & Experience\n\nRobert O'Brien: Distributed Systems Software Engineer (Financial Systems) and Entrepreneur. Co-Founded three start-ups in Financial Data Analytics, International Trade Payments, and Impact Investing. Extensive work in Metadata and Document Engineering.

Over the last thirty years, we've worked on highly concurrent distributed systems using C/C++ and functional languages OCaml, Erlang, Scala, and Haskell.\n\nMetadata Specification for Ricardian Contracts and Contract Terms\n\nA critical component of contract law and user security is preventing people from agreeing to something that will not happen. Therefore, verifiable human-readable contracts are essential to bridging the real world with DeFi, Digital Identity (DID), and NFT solutions.\n\nIan Grigg coined the term Ricardian Contract1 in 1996 while working on one of the first cryptocurrency payment systems. A Ricardian Contract in plain language is a document for a commercial purpose readable by both humans and machines. Readable by humans for mutual understanding. Readable by machines for parameters and execution. The combined bundle is cryptographically verifiable.\n\nBy conforming to a common specification, human-readable contracts can be validated and presented in a consistent and verifiable way. By linking contract terms to specific steps in Smart Contract executions, we can monitor and audit them. This enables using meta-data to record the execution of supply-chain contracts that incorporate warehouse receipts, linking regulatory reporting to steps in compliance, or establishing a Joint-Venture DAO 3.\n\nOur Solution\n\nA standards-based Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) Metadata specification and reference implementation for Ricardian Contracts and Contract Terms.\n\nThis proposal is for working on the initial analysis and design of the specification to incorporate some prototyping toward a reference implementation. We will also work with other proposers of related metadata specifications to ensure the work aligns and is not duplicating efforts.\n\nUsing transaction metadata to instrument smart contract execution is an important consideration. Performance labelling links to the smart contract to human-readable contract terms. Compliance, governance processes, and performance-based financing all require this type of linkage.\n\nAll project documentation, specification, and reference implementations will be\n\npublished to our Github repository using open-source and open-culture licenses. The draft specification will be entered into and shepherded through the Cardano Improvement proposal process.\n\nThe draft specification will draw upon and work with other CIP, and many industry standards and tools; Formalised or defacto standards. That include:\n\nCardano Message Signing Standard CIP-00082: Using Cardano address private keys to sign arbitrary data.\nW3C Verifiable Claims4: Data model for expressing cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable credentials. Including W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification.\nW3C Linked Data5: A set of standards that formalises how to describe and integrate pieces of data across the Web. Of particular interest are JSON-LD and Schema.org.\nProject Accord6 and Catala7: An open ecosystem of structured agreements (Cicero) and Executable logic (Ergo) for building smart agreements and regulation (Catala).\nKantara Consent Receipt Specification12: A human-readable record of consent and receipt. Includes requirements for linking to privacy notices and descriptions of what information has been or will be collected.\nEOSIO.CDT Ricardian Contract Specification8: A specification for Ricardian contracts on EOS blockchains.\nIdentity Foundation Sidetree9: A Protocol for anchoring decentralised identifiers in Blockchains.\nContent Addressable Storage (CAS): Git, IPFS, Dat are tools for storing and replicating blocks of data identified with their content hash.\n\nThat is not an exhaustive list of the prior art. Our specific intent is to map the prior work into the Cardano Ecosystem; To take advantage of Cardano's EUTXO model, native asset and transaction metadata support, and leverage Atala Prism if possible.\n\nThe Cardano Message Signing Standard (CIP-0008), for example, uses address private keys to sign arbitrary data. With the CIP standard, you can verify and check documents, images, user consent receipts, contract terms, and user agents as part of a contract. Since these contract resources may represent a person, company, or DAO, it is essential to know they are signed by the entity and have not been altered.\n\nTo refine and improve the specification for draft publication future funding will be needed. A reference implementation needs development to ensure the specification is practical. Software Development Kits (libraries and tools) will be needed to help developers use the standard.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nOur proposal will perform analysis of prior work, assess the choices for design, estimate future specification effort, and develop a plan to proceed with complete specification work. Draft specification writing, UI mockups, and code prototyping will be completed to help the effort.\n\nAfter one month:\n\nA review of specifications, literature, and existing tools/SDKs related to Ricardian Contracts.\nEngagement with the Cardano community to provide input and feedback has begun.\nConsultation with smart contract developers to help identify needs and points of integration has begun.\n\nAfter three months:\n\nUser journey and UI wireframe mockups are developed to illustrate user scenarios.\nPrototype reference implementation has been deployed on testnet to demonstrate very basic utility.\nThe initial draft of the specification is made available for community review and feedback.\n\nAfter six months:\n\nRefinement of the initial draft specification is completed and submitted into the Cardano Improvement process.\nA development plan for taking the specification through the Cardano Improvement process has been actioned.\nA detailed plan for fully developing a reference implementation and Software Development Kits is submitted to Catalyst.\nA model for the sustainability of the project is actioned. Covering additional funding and ongoing support will be circulated for community feedback and adoption.\n\nAfter twelve months:\n\nThe Specification is a CIP.\nAn SDK for the specification has been developed.\nAt least one Smart-Wallet has integrated the specification.\nAt least one DApp/Financial Solution is using the standard as an integral part of the products feature set.\n\nBudget Breakdown\n\nThe requested Fund 6 budget is for wages and expenses for three months of the project. We will deliver the initial draft specification and related documentation. Further funds will be requested to continue the work beyond this period and develop the proposal to a level needed for submission to the Cardano Improvement Process.\n\nSpecification R&D: $7,000USD (45%)\nUX/UI Prototyping: $2,400USD (15%)\nEngineering: $3,000USD (22%)\nCommunity Engagement: $1,200USD (8%)\nProject Management: $1,500USD (10%)\n\nFTE hourly rate of USD$100 includes all overheads; Adjusted for experience and short term intermittent nature of project funding.

Category theory gives the ability to classify and technically define abstract structures from many different fields and see how they fit together. Taking the insight gained from the process of defining structures in these terms, my goal is to put together a minimal set of rules to govern a good collaborative experience and produce efficient results without the need for top-down control of the process. When you look at a functioning ecosystem in nature, all the organisms involved live in a balance between competition for resources and symbiotic relationships. No one creature has to act outside its natural behavior, and yet, the lives of all species continue. There are constraints on the capacity of adaptation in biology that aren't present in more abstract systems like human collaboration, so assessing which ones help provide beneficial structure and which inhibit innovation is an important distinction to consider.\n\nI should also be able to work on some code to simulate these ideas, and get started on a proof of concept implementation of the resulting protocol.\n\nTimeline:\n\nThree Months: A good part of the writing should be done within this timeframe and some code samples to simulate ideas may also be available.\n\nSix Months: The document and protocol specification should be complete, though it may take more time to implement it.\n\nTwelve Months: I should be able to continue working on an implementation even after the funding period. Anyone else should be able to do the same, and hopefully the ideas generated by this project will improve the collaborative experience of the Cardano community \n\n (Depending on the acceptance of my other proposals, timelines would be subject to change, and I reserve the right to interleave work on each project as I see fit.

I believe that using NFT's to gate access to future content can help athletes provide more than speculation to their digital assets. \n\nWhy athletes?\nJuly 1st of this year, Name Image & Likeness (NIL) rules were drastically changed allowing athletes in the US university and college level accept money for their participation in college programs. This has opened up a wild west that also allows for the legal transaction of NFT's for collegiate content before these athletes ever go pro. \n\nUltimately we want to help create new ways for athletes to partner with university programs to create shared NFT's that bring new sources of revenue to universities after the athletes have left (NFT royalties vs only donations) while rewarding athletes value they deserve while in college. This will also help athletes choose smaller schools where more gameplay = more NFT highlights over second string at power schools. \n\nWhere we are starting\nThere are many stages of athletes but we are starting with 6 - 10 Pilots that will mint the first collection of \"Throwback\" NFT's which take a historical highlight from an old school, home video, and pair it with a new clip of the athlete reliving that moment. This establishes ownership and a genesis point to show universities & schools we can create a new shared revenue pipeline with them and their former athletes using their existing content. This is underway and paves the way for this proposal.\n\n \n\nWork completed to date\n\n- Quicc has an engine to search and modify content based on transcription and other video metadata allowing for rapid (even programmatic) video creation of clips.\n- Cloud infrastructure and core video management tech in market for 2 years.\n- Active and committed pipeline of current, & former pro athletes and their universities creating NFT content.\n\n \n\nScope of FundingThere are many simple NFT's that are already minted and created on the Cardano ecosystem. The focus for this funding is to create Smart Contract Templates for other developers who want to create multi-owner NFT's. As we know there is a significant impact with Smart Contracts that pass down to new owners of NFT's while passing \"acceptable\" royalties back to the school + athlete or any other stakeholder for many utility or transaction use cases in the future it's important to spend time planning a set of standards and stakeholder behaviors to prevent devaluation of early but flawed NFT's.   \n\n1 Stakeholder (schools & athletes) behavior\n- Create standard interview method for defining stakeholder behaviors (20 hours)\n- In a sports use case, identify use cases, examples, stakeholder behaviors through interviews with our industry relationships. (60 hours)\n- Examine the game theory behind the primary use cases to establish proper incentives. (120 hours)\n- Finalize the primary expected outcomes as behavior templates (expected needs, outcomes, barriers) to determine Smart Contract template needs. (40 hours)\n \n\n2 Open Source Smart Contract Templates\n- Create open source smart contract templates for multi owner NFT's with clear documentation on Stakeholder types, value distribution ratios, and long term transaction royalties in Plutus. (250 hours) \n- Create and manage a git repo for community feedback and open source contributions (50 hours)\n \n\nTotal hours - 540 *main criteria for funding (including paying collaborators) \n\n \n\nMeasurables\nTo define the success of our scope, the following will be the success baseline:\n- Onboarding 2-3 more Plutus Pioneer Devs from the community.\n- Interview 12 schools & 12 athletes to create stakeholder behavior templates\n- Create game theory models based on possible incentives based on number of stakeholders (agents) a part of an NFT\n- Setup git repo for Smart Contract drafts\n- Finalize Smart Contract Templates for primary use cases & needs defined in Stakeholder behavior research.\n- Town hall updates\n\n \n\n**EXCEEDING\n- 10+ community Plutus devs contributing to git repo\n- Interviewing 15+ schools & Athletes to define stakeholder behaviors\n- Covering use cases for Highschool athletes, College athletes, and Pro athletes\n\n \n\nTimeline\nTotal timeline for this to be completed is expected to run through the end of Q1 2022 with all deliverables due the first week of April 2022. \n\n \n\nAfter 3 months I expect to be done with school & athlete interviews, wrapping up game theory analysis and have most of our behavior templates ready for final review. We will have also have selected 2-3 Plutus Pioneers to collaborate with on the smart contract development.\n\n \n\nAfter 6 months I expect to be nearly complete with the final Smart Contract Templates and finalizing any outstanding edge cases though the git repo.\n\n \n\nAfter 12 months I expect there to be 100+ forks of our Smart Contract Templates to be used in other Cardano multi-owner NFT projects. \n\n \n\nExpected Impact for the Challenge\nI expect that this research will not only show the value of NFT's on Cardano as low cost way to uniquely identify ownership over a joint licensed piece of content, but provide a new way for these schools & athletes to work together to support each other through new revenue sources from their fans and school supporters who want to give back to their school and the athletes with every trade of the collectible NFT's.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369877-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nProblem Statement\n\nClear Goals\n\nTarget Demographic\n\nAction Plan\n\nRoadmap\n\nPerformance Metrics\n\nSkills Required\n\nBudget Breakdown","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369956-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nOverview\n\nThe success of project catalyst rests upon the success of the ideas brought forth by the community.\n\nBut what if the community isn't voting for the best ideas? \n\nWhat happens to a good idea if it is poorly presented? \n\n——\n\nWhat if there are strong ideas that are not being selected in the voting process because they are not being communicated with clarity and impact?\n\nI would like to level the playing field by providing *all* of the proposers access to a series of designed proposal templates that will become tools that help them to best present their ideas for Project Catalyst. \n\nI would also like to help proposers to understand the fundamentals of presentation design and how to build a clear, concise, and powerful proposal deck that will optimize their chance to succeed in having their idea funded.\n\n——\n\n\"We're looking for tools, we're looking for methodology.\"\n\n - Charles Hoskinson, Keynote for Project Catalyst Weekly Town Hall, August 11, 2021\n\nWhat I'm proposing to create is both a set of tools (slide templates) and also a methodology—a set of principles and guidelines to help guide the user in the process of creating their presentation.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nI believe that these tools and methodologies will benefit three key groups: \n\n1. First, the proposers themselves. By providing some structured, well-designed documents to work with\n\n2. The stakeholders and individuals voting by creating a clearer, more systematic process to gauge one proposal against another and to understand the idea in it's most essential form\n\n3. The entire community: by creating this set of tools and methodologies, it is the community that ultimately wins. This helps to ensure that the strongest, and best ideas rise to the forefront in the process and are seen in their clearest possible light. It helps to ensure that the impact of Project Catalyst, and the governance process that underlies it, is as effective as possible.\n\nCommunity Polls\n\nI conducted several polls on Telegram with the Project Catalyst Proposers, as well as the larger project Catalyst Community, to get a sense of: \n\nA. The value of the templates to proposers. \n\nB. What format are formats would be most valuable for the templates. . \n\nC. If there would be value in having a course on the keys to presentation design, and if so, what format(s) would be most valuable.\n\nHere are the results (2 identical polls in proposer and general project catalyst communities combined here):\n\nQ1: Would you benefit from being able to submit a proposal and professionally design template? (26 total votes)\n\nYes 73%\n\nNo 8%\n\nPossibly 19%\n\nQ2: If you answered yes or possibly, what format(s) would be most useful for you to work with? (Select all that apply) (17 total votes)\n\nGoogle Slides 76%\n\nPowerPoint 23%\n\nKeynote 29%\n\n**Q3:**Would you benefit from a quick course in deck presentation design? If so what format(s) would be most useful to you? Select all that apply.\n\nLive Workshop 33%\n\nSeries of short videos/screencasts 60%\n\nLonger video/screencast presentation 33%\n\nRecording of live workshop 27%\n\nPDF with screenshots 33%\n\nI would not benefit from this 0%\n\nTakeaways from the polls\n\nClearly there's a perceived community value in both having proposal templates available and also to having resources for better understanding the principles of presentation design.\n\nAlthough there's no unanimous consent on the format that they should be delivered in, it appears that Google Slides is the strongest initial contender. It also has the added benefit of being available for free to anyone who wants to set up a free Google account, and the ability to export as PDFs which could be uploaded the Ideascale.\n\nSimilarly, creating a short series of videos with screencasts would be the most immediately beneficial to the greatest number of people.\n\nI would note that these formats could be built upon in future funding rounds, but for now it makes sense to focus on the MVP.\n\nTemplate Creation\n\nI believe that 4-6 templates would be a good MVP that provides enough breadth to choose from initially while not creating an overwhelming library to choose from. This, of course, is something that could be augmented in subsequent rounds with different template organization and categories to help further define specific areas of funding.\n\nI would envision that this would be an iterative process, whereby proposers could provide feedback to the templates which would be refined in future stages and future funding rounds to continue to evolve with the proposers needs.\n\nOutreach\n\nThe final aspect of the project would entail the marketing and outreach to make these proposals available to they propose us in the community at large. This would take place through multiple channels: via telegram and discord, as many presentations in one or more Townhall's, and linked in various documents and on related resource sites.\n\nKey Milestones\n\n3 Months\n\nInitial 2 to 3 templates are designed and provided in PDF format for feedback to a subset of the community.\n\n6 Months\n\nBased on the feedback, refinements are made to design and initial 2 to 3 decks are built out as Google slides to be distributed to the community. Design work begins and has made progress on the additional 2 to 3 templates  \n\n12 Months\n\nAll of the 4-6 final templates are available and actively in use within the community. Based on existing data, measurements of successful proposals to be determined as measured against those not using proposal templates. (See metric section below.)\n\n \n\nMetrics\n\nThough there are many things that could be measured, ultimately, the best metric to evaluate the success of this project will be to measure how many ideas that use the proposal templates are funded versus those that do not. \n\n \n\nBudget Requirements\n\nProposal Template Design and Revision $10K\n\nProposal Slide Development/Build $4K\n\nQ/A Testing $2.5K\n\nPreparation and Creation of Video Series on principles of presentation Design ~8 videos @$1.25k/video = $10K\n\nOutreach/marketing  across various channels (ongoing) =$2.5K\n\nTotal Budget Required $29K\n\n \n\nTotal Value Delivered\n\nIf funded, I believe that this system of template development and it's inherent structure would not just level the playing field for all the proposers, but also raise the bar for everyone. The result would be that the advisers and community Voters would be able to focus their energies on debating the merits of the ideas rather than spending time getting clarity on the actual nature of the ideas themselves.\n\nUltimately, investing in this proposal is investing in the future roadmap of Project Catalyst. This project optimizes the possibility of greater success for the proposers, the stakeholders, the entire community, and I would argue, the value of ADA itself.\n\n \n\nIn Closing\n\nThank you for the opportunity to propose for this exciting project at an equally exciting juncture in the companies evolution.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369958-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369960-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.\n\nOur business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.\n\nThis approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services\n\nCOST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.\nMATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.\nTRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?\n\nWe solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. \n\nWe solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a the decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.\n\nAnother great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.\n\nThe key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.\n\nTechnical approach\n\nThe web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.\n\nFounder bios\n\nGabe Gralla is a software engineer, data scientist, and technology leader based in Boston. He most recently served as Chief Information Officer at Zero, a non-profit building COVID safety apps. Before that, he was Director of Data Engineering at Lyte, an early engineer at Moat (acquired by Oracle), and an independent consultant with clients ranging from enterprise healthcare companies to crypto startups.\n\nSam Gralla is a physics professor at the University of Arizona known for his work on black holes. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award and the IUPAP young scientist prize in General Relativity and Gravitation. He is an accomplished teacher and public speaker. Check out a popular public lecture he gave on gravitational waves (https://youtu.be/Dn33_ySzB-w).\n\n(We are cousins.)\n\nTimeline\n\nDevelopment of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.\n\nThe definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.\n\nThe definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.\n\nThe definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!\n\nCampaign suitability\n\nSince our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal will support our efforts to customize Tutorchain for use with the Catalyst process. Interacting with the Catalyst community, there is clearly a need for expert proposers to connect with newcomers, but it is relatively disorganized (mainly some scattered discord servers and channels) and mainly limited to volunteer efforts. While we are all for pro-bono, community-based work, we think that injecting a modicum of capitalism may lead to huge improvements in results. We think a properly-incentivised expert marketplace could really help. The success of an expert marketplace relies on an initial critical mass of high-quality experts, good marketing to in-need learners, and good customer service to work out the kinks. We are requesting $5k to support these efforts for Catalyst.\n\nWhy should Catalyst voters support this project?\n\nWhile the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good \"geek out\" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.\n\nWe think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common \"lack of developer buy-in\" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.\n\nMore information\n\nWe will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824.

We warmly welcome you to join if you have perspectives/ideas/skills to bring to the table.  \n\nWho do we need on the team for Fund6?  This project involves networking individuals who are not crypto savvy and making it easy for them to participate, so there will be an emphasis on user-friendly front end.  We may (or may not) need to deploy sound smart contracts that are adapted from e.g. Marlowe and execute on block chains/side chains (TBD).  While we may not begin the \"build\" in this funding round, it would be extremely helpful to have the developer expertise there to help us understand what is possible.  Because we may be stepping into the waters of financial regulations, we also need a legal expert in this field to assure that we aren't opening a can o' regulatory worms.\n\nWe also look forward to piggybacking on the great work happening in the Cardano NFT marketplace world.  Some of the biggest open questions in the project are related to how NFTs are bought and sold, both initially and in the aftermarket.  Looking forward to exploring our options with this exciting community!\n\nSTEP 1: COLLECT THE GENES\n\nThe first step in any breeding program worth its muster is to amass a collection of wild strains, preserved as mycelial cultures.  These cultures can be held at any of the participating mycological Culture Libraries.  For now, these culture libraries simply back up copies of the culture and keep them in safe long term storage.  Down the road, the culture libraries will be responsible for cloning and distributing strains to growers involved in the breeding program.\n\nWho collects the genes?  Foragers!  For a forager to participate they must a) open an ada wallet,  and share b) a photo of the wild mushroom c) metadata associated with the wild strain (location and time of harvest, species of tree host etc.) , and d) a name for their strain and most importantly they must e) send a viable culture of their strain's mycelium to a participating culture library.  For now, we will leave out f) the smart-contract piece.  \n\nWhy would a forager want to participate?  Besides the desire to participate in a fun passion project?  Here's where NFTs make their entrance.  A forager that goes through all required steps is issued a token that symbolizes or represents their strain(s).  This NFT, either through natural market forces or executable smart contracts gives them a potential \"stake\" in the final product.  If a strain they provided goes through the decentralized breeding program and ends up contributing genetics to a final commercial strain, then the value of their NFT goes up, either organically, or through executing their equity.  Before we proceed, it's important to make a distinction between two types of NFTs that we can deploy:\n\nWild-Type vs Executable NFTs pt. 1\n\nMy understanding is that we can break NFTs into two categories: one I'll call \"wild-type\" and the other I'll call \"executable\" for lack of better words.  There may be better terms for these concepts floating out there.  Wild type NFT is one that functions solely as a collectible.  While there may be basic smart contracts that enable more functionality than standard collectibles e.g. splitting up ownership, or even royalties paid out during aftermarket activity, these smart contracts pertain only to the collectible itself.  An executable NFT on the other hand represents other assets beyond the NFT itself.  Smart contracts can execute functions that relate to the underlying assets.\n\nIn my view, if we have a shot at accomplishing what we want with a Wild Type NFT, we should give it a shot.  In other words, if we can rely on the raw \"collectability\" of a token, we can perhaps achieve our goals with limited regulatory contact.\n\nIn the wild type, the NFT is a collectible that functions as a \"symbol\" of a wild mushroom strain.  In the executable type, the NFT represents a physical asset (the genes of a wild mushroom).\n\nIn the latter type, smart contracts define the owners equity in the final product (the commercial strain(s)) should they be lucky enough to contribute genetics.\n\nBut, wouldn't it be cool if the game theoretics of the marketplace play out such that a wild-type NFT owned by a forager (a collectible that chronicles a wild strain rather than represents it)  would organically demand a higher price on the open market thanks to its scarcity, uniqueness, and the story around it?\n\n****Please see comments from @solarcatzshelley below for more relevant info on the Howey Test and how this applies to the NFTs in this proposal and others.***on to step 2:\n\n \n\nSTEP 2: GROW OUT AND BREED THE STRAINS:\n\nAt this point we have culture libraries filled with backups of unique strains.  We have the gene pool we need to begin actively growing and breeding the strains.  Now it's time to activate the Growers!\n\n A mushroom like chicken of the woods is going to have only a small fraction of wild strains produce even a tiny fruit indoors.  A strain that produces a fruit, any fruit, is a viable candidate for further breeding, especially if the fruit matures healthily and produces spores (generating even more genetic potential).  Other characteristics that might \"level up\" a strain in the program would be flavor, promiscuity of tree host type, or other phenotypic indicators.\n\nWhat would incentivize a grower (farmer, hobbyist, research company) to work with the strains?  Well. the hope of breeding something good!  If a forager is incentivize to contribute viable wild strains, a grower is incentivized to advance the breeding program by identifying which wild strains fruit, crossing spores of fruiting strains to yield new strains with e.g. higher yields.  New strains are new NFTs, whether from the wild or from the lab.  \n\nHow does a grower gain access to the genetic library?  First, they must pledge to share any new viable strains that they develop with culture libraries, to be shared with other growers.  We hope that social pressure will prevent them from going rogue and conducting a proprietary breeding program; i.e. if they come out with their commercial strain without sharing it, we shame them for being bad actors in the community, and they are unable to participate in the co-branding opportunity (see below).  If there is genetic analysis done on strains, there may even be evidence of wrongdoing.  Anyway, to facilitate the economics of the whole thing, growers may also pay the culture libraries for their strains.  This is how culture libraries traditionally make their money, so this is pretty close to business-as-usual.\n\n \n\nSTEP 3: ACHEIVING COMMERCIAL STRAIN STATUS\n\nSo now we have wild strains backed up by NFTs, we have cultivated strains backed up by NFTs, and we are beginning to make headway.  With every generation, new, better strains are coming out until eventually a grower makes a big hit.  They grow a mushroom that is commercially viable, meaning it's high yielding (enough), tastes good, has decent shelf life, and growth parameters that are fairly easily duplicated.\n\nIf you are the grower who hits the jackpot, your NFT represents a commercially viable strain, the metadata includes any important information related to substrate, temperature, fruiting platforms, incubation time etc.  You submit an early-generation culture to a culture library, and that culture library backs up versions of this to go out to other culture libraries, so the entire community of growers involved in the project has access to the youngest, least senescent version of this strain to begin growing the strain for market.\n\nTo incentivize the project as a whole, we will try and keep the strain \"in the family\" at first while we keep things quiet on the marketing side, giving the network of growers a chance to be the first to get chicken of the woods to their customers.  Inevitably, someone will clone the mushroom from a store and the commercial strain will get out into the public, albeit not backed up in its youngest form.  But that's ok, because the project was a success!\n\n \n\nFURTHER DISCUSSION\n\nWild-Type vs Executable NFTs pt 2.  equity chain of custody vs co-branding\n\nMaking our way back to the question of wild type vs executable NFTs.  Culture libraries, spawn companies make their money by selling commercial strains and spawn made from these strains.  This is an established income stream.  Perhaps there is incentive for culture libraries to be involved to give them first dibs on selling the cultures and spawn to buyers. \n\nChain of Custody via Executable-Type NFTs.  If this is the case, the executable-type NFTs could all connect up to this company itself to the point that all sales of the strain distribute profit down the chain- to the grower that developed the final strain to all the growers who contributed genetics to that strain to all the foragers who contributed genetics to those strains.  All through  smart-contract-backed-NFTs.\n\nCo-Branding via Wild Type NFTs. On the other hand, if we go the wild-type NFT route, we may be able to leverage the story in an ongoing way to encourage value to flow organically through to members in the chain of custody.  Growers can co-brand the chicken of the woods products they sell to end-consumers, plastering the packaging with a collage of all the images of the NFTs that contributed to the final product.  Future fans of the product will see those images, read up on the backstory and find out that they too can play along by becoming the proud owner of one of those NFTs.  They visit the project's NFT marketplace (auction??) and pay up. \n\nnon-NFT-based profit sharing\n\nThere can also be smart contracts deployed in the project not connected to NFTs.  There can be, for instance, some level of profit sharing for all participants, whether they contributed to the final strain or not.  This might look like future \"releases\" of NFTs by the project as a whole, where % proceeds go out to all participants.  \n\nonboarding a new network to Cardano\n\nA valuable \"bi-product\" :  We now have a network of foragers, growers, labs etc with Ada wallets and a track record of participating in real-life applications.  We can use this network to tackle new challenges.  The network of foragers and farmers and their markets can drive new innovation in areas like establishing incentives for responsible stewardship of forests  (sorely needed, blog post coming out eventually on this topic).  We can take on new species for similar breeding programs.  The sky's the limit.  And with more activity, we drive more adoption, more wallets opening up and a strong network effect.  \n\nThe end result?  Cardano is the digital ecosystem for Mushroom people.  And mushroom people are the coolest :)\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nShould we be fortunate enough to earn funding for this project, the next step is to actually build it out!  The front end, the marketplace, smart contracts, marketing team etc.  This will be a much larger undertaking than the proof-of-concept we hope to develop with funding this round.  \n\nBut a breeding program takes time.  It's likely 2+ years until a given commercial strain comes to fruition.  There is no reason to wait 2 years to begin taking action on the product side.  Using our network of foragers (and onboarding yet more with this:) we can begin marketing different \"decentralized\" product(s).  I have a delicious, nutritious, warm, creamy, rich, chaga-full beverage recipe that tells a story of the forest and which utilizes 4+ wild-crafted products.  I would be more than happy to \"decentralize\" this recipe in order to get a jumpstart on answering first-principle questions related to \"what is a decentralized product?\" A recipe clue: the main ingredient is chaga.\n\n \n\nTIMELINE (no later than...)\n\n3 Months: Establish the core team responsible for releasing the \"proof of concept\"\n\n6 Months:  produce a white paper/ white board + initial build outs / mock ups.\n\n9 Months:  seek additional funding proposal for the build-out (via catalyst and/or issuance of Cardano Conk NFTs and/or traditional financing)\n\n12 Months: Public Launch, by September 2022 40+ unique wallet addresses from foragers and 2+ culture libraries so we can begin collecting wild strains.\n\n \n\nBUDGET\n\n2500 for telling the story, white paper, white board, networking in the mushroom world (that's me and those who want to help)\n\n3000 for developer consultation and mock-ups (front-end, smart contracts, user experience)\n\n500 for legal consultation as relates to regulations and NFTs.  \n\n \n\nMy Commitment:  Whether this proposal receives funding or not, I am committed to helping to make Cardano and Catalyst as strong an ecosystem as possible, and I will continue to share my general and proposal-specific thoughts on the blog regenseed.io\n\n \n\nThank you for your consideration.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369962-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369964-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n*** Our philosophy ***\n\nBitcoin gave us free-circulating money. Ethereum established a framework for decentralized engineering. Cardano upgraded and formalized scalability and robustness. The next evolution, we think, is an NFT-enabled free-circulation, traceability and marketization of intellectual property rights. And by extension, knowledge.\n\n \n\n*** Consultants/Advisors ***\n\nTariq Daouda, PhD\n\nMachine learning specialist\n\nCEO of Bluwr, a calm plateform for sharing ideas freely and easily.\n\nhttps://www.bluwr.com/\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tariqdaouda\n\n \n\nRoger Palou, PhD\n\nMicrobiome engineering specialist\n\nResearch associate and science communicator\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-palou-phd-b963622a\n\n \n\n*** Our media links ***\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sciwalkart/\n\nhttps://sciwalkart.bigcartel.com/\n\n \n\n*** Problem definition ***\n\nAcademic publishing primarily happens in closed-access journals (dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375) and is the only system in which authors lose all rights to their creations. The current system is certainly not ideal, especially when contrasted with other publishing fields such as newspapers, biographies, scripts, plays and novels.\n\nScientific publishing is a multi-billion dollar industry in which scientists generate the product and receive no benefit. In addition, the top-ranking companies have profits that can go up to 40%, meaning there is a big margin to redirect some of these benefits to the scientists. The problem is that there is no platform currently in place that would allow a connection between the producer (scientist) and the profits generated by the product (scientific content). What is lacking is a bridge for profits to flow directly to the scientist, without the need for a middleman.\n\nWith the growing popularity of open access journals (PLOS publisher), the scientific community seems to recognize that the marketization of research has reached a state of oligopoly (few journals with massive influence are able to overprice access to research).\n\nFree-circulating knowledge would allow for different monetization schemes for scientists, something researchers in every domain needs. The more funding for research, the better.\n\nFor knowledge to truly become free-circulating, the following 3 criteria need to be met.\n\nResearchers should keep ownership of their products.\nThey should be able to reap the benefits of those products when/if they become popular/impactful.\nThe public should have a right to transparent and easy access to the science they helped fund.\n\n \n\n*** In depth ***\n\nThe current distribution of scientific knowledge to the world is based on a dual system: (1) Through private publishing groups that are in large part closed-access, and (2) with a patent-oriented system which is even more restrictive. We tend to believe that there is a better way.\n\nScientific results and documents are perceived by scientists as tools used to communicate new discoveries. However, they have an additional value for society. Compared to how a biography is a means for an individual to share their thoughts and experiences to the public, a scientific article is a tool scientists use to communicate with other scientists, almost exclusively, unfortunately due to the very nature of the medium itself. In fact, articles contain opinions, notably in the discussion section of a paper. Thus, scientific knowledge has intrinsic value beyond its logical conclusions, meaning a manuscript can be conceptualized as a literary document (such as a novel, journal, opinion article or poetry) or even a piece of art (such as photography, paintings) crafted to present results in the most honest and unbiased fashion. Like a vintage piece of literature or an art collectible, it could be acquired and traded.\n\nJust as the first X-ray crystallography of DNA by Rosalind Franklin (https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XHZX.jpg) is viewed by many as a highly valued collectible, right now, digital content of this sort cannot enjoy the same properties. NFT technology is the missing link that would make this possible. How cool would it have been if the first paper that coined the name 'CRISPR' (dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x) was minted as an NFT ?\n\nManuscripts and other science collectibles can be minted into open science NFTs (osNFTs) and made available to society.\n\n \n\nIn this model, a scientific document or image would be transformed into an osNFT, creating verifiable rights for these digital assets. A system based on osNFTs would simultaneously retain the original author's copyright and make the asset a tradable product. Pre-set royalties would ensure perpetual revenue streams to the author/lab, where legal entities allow.\n\nTransforming scientific results into osNFTs would effectively create a bridge between science and society. An asset can be acquired from the scientist and traded, establishing a market that would help identify which scientific questions are most relevant to society. In other words, supply and demand would generate a new metric by which we measure how society perceives a given scientific challenge. Creation of scientific content in this context would now be subject to quasi free-market conditions, unshackled from the selfish expectations of centralized entities. It would be a place where the public can have a say in the direction of science, effectively leading to a better democratization of it.\n\n \n\nWhat is needed is a marketplace to make all of this possible.\n\n \n\nWe believe that value can be generated with \"Pay-per-own\" and \"Pay-per-view\" monetization strategies:\n\n\"Pay-per-own\": as a collectible, there is inherent value in a document that first reports a new method or discovery (historical, legal or religious documents have economic value as collectible items). An original scientific digital asset can be owned by someone who either (1) sees value in this item and expects its value to grow or (2) wants to donate to the field, and thus receive a 'stamp' which would effectively serve as a proof-of-donation. In the latter scenario, a re-sell of the osNFT would not generate income for the buyer (person who donated the money), the money would go instead to a treasury that would be used to fund additional research.\n\"Pay-per-view\": the current publication system requires authors to pay to publish and readers to pay exorbitant fees to access the document (tens of dollars for just one paper, or via subscription through universities, who pay fees so high, that the journal often times prohibits the university from publicly declaring the amount paid in subscriptions, money that very likely also comes from tax money and donations). In the case of open-access publications, readers can access the document for free, but the authors need to pay thousands of dollars to publish (https://plos.org/publish/fees/). In both cases, someone is at a huge financial disadvantage. With the \"pay-per-view\" strategy, for a very small price, anyone can get virtual access to the document, with the funds going to the author. The fee would be counted in cents, so that the user is not impacted when, say, they access hundreds of papers, but for the author, the sum of those small fees would add up to a substantial amount. A high-impact paper, with say 100k views a year, would yield 1000$/year if the price for viewing it is only 1 cent. Sadly, with the current web2 publishing standards, this model is not enforceable. However, with decentralized web3 open access journals that will inevitably come into existence, \"par-per-view\" has the potential to revolutionize the way science is funded, leading to true decentralization of research. We would love to address this point following the hopeful success of this proposal.\n\n \n\nWith all that, we strongly believe that the Cardano ecosystem, coupled with the osNFT model, would be the ideal platform to monetize digital content that is currently not being exploited by the scientific community, i.e., open access papers with copyright retention for the authors.\n\n \n\n*** Concrete plan ***\n\nAs fun and revolutionary as our ideas might be, we are strongly of the view that being effective with a focused plan is better than having a great idea that is unable to gain traction. We do not wish to wait for a decentralized peer-review publishing platform to exist before we can apply our monetization strategy (Pay-per-own and Par-per-view). Instead, we will pour all our efforts in making the osNFT appeal to the public. This will give us our proof-of-concept that we will be able to build upon. After all, bitcoin itself was developed as a proof-of-concept before worldwide consensus decided to make it a global currency :).\n\n \n\nIncreasing public interest in science is our first and foremost priority, we are aware that NFTs are a concept that can be very abstract to people outside the crypto space. People can generally understand NFTs when applied to pictures, music, and other traditional art. Applying it to a high-level concept, such as knowledge, in the sense that we refer to here, would need a break-in period for most people to get a good grasp on its utility. For these reasons, will be focusing on 4 things:\n\nEstablishing a clear standard with visual examples of what an osNFT is.\nConverting scientific content into art pieces while applying scientific rigour.\nIntroducing open-access papers into the system, asking authors to create or assist in the creation of visual representation of their paper's conclusions.\nBuild a marketplace for osNFTs that is visually appealing to most people.\n\n \n\n*** Challenge metrics ***\n\nStrategically, as science is heavily based on funding and more and more scientific research is purely 'dry' (informatics and data analysis), this project would most definitely expose a substantial number of highly skilled individuals to the Catalyst project and to the whole Cardano ecosystem, resulting in a net inflow of brain power to Cardano.\n\n \n\n*** Execution steps ***\n\nPhase 1 (1 month)\n\nFormally define the osNFT standard and its underlying legal component (Open-Source, CC-BY, etc.).\nAmass high-quality data and constructive feedback from high-profile PIs (Principal Investigators), from contacts at our workplace (academic high-tech research center).\nGenerate primitive osNFTs from PhD student's work (beautiful microscopy photos, sexy graphs, etc.) as a proof of concept.

As with NFT art, the data itself can be stored permanently in a blockchain (see Arweave), with the digital signature of authenticity connected to the data via a hash check tied to the Cardano NFT. NFTs can also be used as a funding model, via sales of artistically rendered trading cards.\n\n##  Current Situation\n\nFor the past 5 years I have worked with the Digital Life project, and our partners, to scan and share 3D models of life on earth for the purpose education, conservation and open access science. We collected many terabytes worth of data, from written measurements, to photographs, to CT scans, photogrammetry scans and finalised much of this data in scientific papers and animated 3D models. To simplify collaboration and ensure that our process can be shared, we use open-source tools for the processing of the data. Our partners agree to the sharing of this information with the rest of the world.\n\nTherefore, our finalised models are put online, and free to use for non-commercial purposes.\n\nOur current animal library: https://sketchfab.com/DigitalLife3D\n\nExamples of some of our project processes include:\n\nGreat Hammerhead Shark - Nemesis\nhttps://angari.org/3dgreathammerheadshark/\nsea turtles\nhttps://digitallife3d.org/stories/2018/3/27/creating-3d-models-of-sea-turtles-1\nSouthern White Rhino - Bakari\nhttps://perthzoo.wa.gov.au/article/bakari-360\n\n##  Challenges\n\nThe biggest challenges with such a project involve team scalability, proof of authenticity and accessibility.\n\nWe also require an immutable *permanent* storage for the data. Currently, most of this data exists on centralized servers that are owned by third parties. There is no guarantee that this data will survive 50+ years, much less the next 10.\n\nIn order to progress towards a goal of digitally capturing life on our planet, we need a massive team, and systems that permit the flexibility to handle the various scanning scenarios (in the lab, in the forest, on the beach, under water, etc.) This requires a large and *diverse* team.\n\nDigitizing and cleaning up these 3D models require weeks and/or months of work, requiring budgets that can put pressure on a project, which could result in compromised quality or unpaid work for time invested. Payments often flow through a third party, with payments being delayed for weeks or months.\n\nMany of the artists working in these projects, including myself, do not have a science degree from an accredited academic establishment. Our reputation is based on our work and our relationships. Unfortunately, this information is not easily accessible or verifiable. Additionally, some of our work is of a very sensitive nature, and there might be a scenario where one would be uncomfortable with putting their home addresses on publications. Without an official role at an accredited establishment, or a home address, this could affect reputation of the data or publication.\n\nHow can we \"pass the torch\" for our research? How can we ensure we are using best ethical practices. How can How does an anonymous researcher collaborate, create reputation or receive funding without association to a *physical* establishment? How can we ensure that the work is authentic, immutable and ethical?\n\n###  Solutions\n\nNFTs are (literally) the missing link in all this. Like a web, they connect the data to an immutable record of the individuals involved in the research. Utilizing blockchain storage technologies like Arweave, the data can be stored in an immutable state with a connection to the NFT via verifiable hash. Currently, this method of storing artistic JPGs is being used, more and more, by the various NFT platforms.\n\n*see arweave.org\n\nNFTs can be awarded to patrons as a \"trophy\" to publicly demonstrate their contributions. If these trophies are ever passed on, a portion of the sale can be shared with the creators and partners, to seed future projects.\n\nNFTs can also be used as entry tickets to patrons, granting access to \"work in progress\" data, enabling them to follow the process of the project prior to the final model being released to the public.\n\nReputation is established via association, visible in the blockchain. Connections can be made between the artists, scientists and patrons. This creates a transparent record of partnerships which can be used to determine effective partnerships. Perhaps PRISM could even be helpful in this scenario, though with the option to give reputation to an artist, researcher or patron that wishes to remain anonymous, while still receiving reputation.\n\n###  Moving Into the Future\n\nThough outside the scope of this proposal, I would like to touch on some of the other solutions for the future.\n\nIn regards to payments: smart contracts could be used to enable partnerships to funded via escrow accounts. This could also allow for the transparency of project funding.\n\nTeams could integrate these smart contract methods with projects like Swarm, where temporary storage could be used for works in progress, triggering payments when milestone deliveries are made.\n\n*see https://www.ethswarm.org/\n\nTo improve on the scientific method, the peer review process could be managed by a system like Cardano's Catalyst. When working with animals, ethics is always a major concern, and involving peers in a way where they can vote on methods used, can hopefully steer us into the most sustainable and compassionate procedures.\n\n##  Summary\n\nHaving spent years pondering these problems, the biggest challenge tends to be the speed and reliability of non-democratic centralised systems, the immutability permanent storage, and archaic funding models.\n\nAdditionally, as we work in conservation, there will always be concerns that many of the decentralised systems are inefficient, inaccessible and the massive amount of energy consumed is dangerous to the planet.\n\nCardano solves many, if not *all* these concerns.\n\nCardano is built to be a scalable system that allows for the use of NFTs, hash checks, smart contracts, voting, wallets and integration with outside decentralised data storage solutions.\n\nI believe this system could act as the foundation for the preservation of science and culture (but am starting with what I know).\n\nAdditionally, I believe the strong visual element to this work allows others to bridge their current concepts of what NFTs are for (artwork) with something new (science).\n\nFor more information on the details of our project, see the linked video or see our contribution on page 54 of CLIR's 3D/VR.

The world is becoming FLATTER.\n\nWhether American, Russian, Ethiopian, or Vietnamese...through the Internet (Google, Youtube, The Moods...and other free platforms), through global cooperation programs, ...we will gradually have the same ability to access and exploit the vast resources of human knowledge, we will have equal opportunities to access the most advanced educational systems in the world...\n\nTherefore, the gaps in technology, techniques, culture, services... will gradually narrow and be equal among all countries and regions .\n\nThe faster something grows, the stronger it grows, the faster it flows to the \"valleys\"\n\nBlockchain technology in general and the Cardano platform in particular is no exception, will also \"MUST\" flow into the \"valleys\".\n\nAnd Vietnam is one of such \"valleys\".\n\nWe are facing a great opportunity to enter the Blockchain market:\n\n- In recent years, Blockchain is developing strongly all over the world, gradually showing its practicality in the economy, health care, education...\n\n- On December 16, 2020, the Prime Minister of Vietnam officially included Blockchain Technology in the List of Digital Technology fields that need to focus on research and development to actively participate in the revolution of Industry No.4.\n\n- Vietnam is still in the golden population period, young people are enthusiastic, passionate about technology, ready to accept new challenges, desire to change their personal lives, raise the national position...\n\nNow or never.\n\nWe need to win a \"place\" in this \"historic technological revolution\".\n\nOtherwise, we will be left behind the rest of the World.\n\n\"Vietnamese can run 500 mph or 5 mph. It is fine. But the important thing is that you have to run. If you stand still, the world will ignore you.\" – Thomas Loren Friedman (author of \"The World Is Flat\")\n\n--> Blockchain technology in general and Cardano in particular will \"flow\" into Vietnam, irresistible. But in order to accelerate, we need a \"Canal\" – that is Cardano Vietnam Information Center (1)\n\n5.2. The need to access information of the Vietnamese community\n\nOnly Cardano Community in Vietnam, we have about 40,000 members (Telegram and Facebook). This number will be much larger when Cardano is getting hotter and hotter. Most of them want to find out information about the project they are interested in, but have language barriers, expertise, and time constraints.\n\nSpontaneous individuals/groups form their own communities, resulting in inconsistent and non-standardized, repetitive, and uncensored sources of information and documents; follow the same Cardano project but the community will have to join a lot of different groups, causing time consuming, and confusing information…\n\nAfter nearly 4 years of taking care of and following the community, and most recently, surveying the Vietnam Cardano community through asking basic questions (about 20 questions) about Cardano as well as the Cardano ecosystem. I found that only about 1/5 of the participants answered the question correctly. The rest answered wrong or did not know. This result shows the sad reality: Cardano has been introduced since 2015 (ADA- a native token launched in 2017), but most of the Cardano Vietnam community doesn't know the basics. So what are they investing in? What type of investment? Honestly, they're investing in something they don't know what it is. This is the biggest risk when investing in finance.\n\nThe results of the investigation show that the main reason for 90% of them not knowing or answering the question incorrectly is: they want to understand more about Cardano but do not understand English, especially Blockchain English. Without English skills, it is difficult for them to access official information and documents from Cardano. And even if they have official sources of information and documents, they can't read &understand it.\n\nDuring nearly 4 years of establishment, Cardano Vietnam team has been translating information and documents (IOHK' blog, Video, Event...) into Vietnamese to share with the community. We have also built a database to create Bots to help the community look up information on their own (May 2021); we've editted Cardano related videos for the community to understand; we've participated in IOHK's programs ( Shelley Summit 2020, Cardano 360, Catalyst TowHall...), Cardano Foundation's (like The Cardano Foundation's Strategy...) ...\n\nBut we only shared directly on Telegram, You can check out some of our translations and Bot here:\n\nhttps://t.me/CardanoVietnam/189793\n\nhttps://t.me/CardanoVietnam/188645\n\nhttps://t.me/CardanoVietnam/188062\n\nhttps://t.me/CardanoVietnam/177707\n\nhttps://t.me/CardanoVietnam/184235\n\n.....\n\nThat was a mistake, because the community will be very difficult to find them again for reference.\n\nThe community wants to understand Cardano but doesn't understand English. We understand English, translates information & documents for the community, but only saves it on Telegram, but has not been centrally saved on the website, youtube, or blog...(2)\n\n(1) & (2) -->We realize that it is necessary to establish Cardano Vietnam Information Center as a center to store official information & documents about Cardano in Vietnamese.\n\n5.3.

Additional partners in Africa e.g. Kumasi Hive in Ghana, MRC Gambia, pioneering labs participating in the \"Africa Grand Challenges\" drug discovery initiative) will be onboarded onto the Fleming ecosystem by the end of this year, or early next year. We will add it in the comments section and our Discord for review.\n\nPlease also join our Discord as we would love to actively work with the Cardano community to ensure the success of Fleming Protocol in Africa. This is where you can keep up with our latest progress, and where we plan to share our revised whitepaper, plans/timelines for an****Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISO), and tokenomics/govenrance proposal.\n\n \n\nFleming Protocol was recently selected to join the highly competitive Outlier Ventures Base Camp accelerator (https://outlierventures.io/base-camp/), who believe strongly in our vision for drug and medical discovery in Africa. This is exciting news as this will allow us to access their wealth of expertise/experience in the blockchain/Web 3 space (e.g. expertise in go to market strategies, token sale structuring, technical, tokenomics and legal expertise etc) and will open up many doors for more funding amongst other things. As we are likely to incorporate IPFS decentralised data storage as part of Fleming Protocol, we'll also, as a result of the accelerator, have access to the support and expertise of Protocol Labs (https://protocol.ai/), who have extensive and valuable experience building the next generation of decentralised internet applications (e.g. Filecoin, IPFS etc). The accelerator started in early September 2021 and lasts until the end of the year.\n\n \n\nOverview of Fleming Protocol\n\nFleming Protocol is a decentralised, open-source drug discovery ecosystem that connects scientists, crowd investors and institutions, enabling the most impactful research to be translated into real-world therapeutics and devices. We believe that such a platform will have tremendous utility in helping Africa overcome its shortfall in pharma/medical R&D and production.\n\nThe open-source nature will allow open access to trained scientists within Africa, who can share their expertise in one central respiratory, but also utilise a growing global network of leading scientists/institutions e.g. Inserm, Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), University of Paris, independent scientists from the citizen science-based JOGL platform, and members/institutions associated with the Open Source Pharma Foundation.\n\nFleming's cryptoeconomics will present new funding opportunities for open-source R&D, making such efforts sustainable over the long term. Our focus on Africa will allow Cardano stakeholders, with an interest in the region, to support R&D projects that have the potential to create a self-sustaining industry within the continent, and thus reducing Africa's disease burden.\n\nOur ambition is to leverage capital generated from the Fleming ecosystem to jump-start local R&D, provide generic drug manufacturing capabilities and ancillary methods to create safe, effective and available local sources.\n\nWe are developing this ecosystem in close collaboration with academic scientists as well as citizen science organisations, e.g. the University of Cape-Town/H3D and the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) in Paris. This will allow us to build and adapt the infrastructure to host projects ranging from small community-based solutions to large academic drug discovery efforts. These R&D projects would be within the realm of conditions that burden the continent the most.\n\nPlease, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/kxmHu5HE\n\nHow do we plan to spend Fund 6 funds?\n\nThis will go almost exclusively to paying our engineering team, who have a wealth of experience in Haskell and are working extremely hard to develop and launch our MVP on Plutus.

The importance of the Catalyst Project in the development of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nAt the end of September 2021 it is expected that we will activate Smart Contract. That will be the time to mark the landing of a series of projects running on the Cardano platform, contributing to the expansion of the ecosystem in the future.\n\nAnd the Catalyst Project is a very important part of the expansion of that ecosystem.\n\nBut, the results of the Cardano Vietnam community survey show: about 89% don't know Catalyst, or don't care about Catalyst... The numbers showed the problem.\n\nThrough the investigation, we once again found that the language barrier has restricted the Vietnamese community from accessing Catalyst in particular and the Cardano ecosystem in general.\n\nThat's why we wanted to Design an online course about Catalyst in Vietnamese.\n\n5.2. Implement Plan:\n\n5.2.1. Month #1\n\n- Building White Paper (status, problems, goals, causes, solutions...)\n\n- Develop a specific work implementation plan based on 5W2H.\n\n- Build infrastructure: domain, host server, design website on wordpress, design intro/outtro for Youtube channel... hire experts for post-processing.\n\n- Organize and synthesize advanced and official information sources about Catalyst.\n\n- Develop specific lesson plans of the course.\n\n5.2.2.

Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.\n\nOur business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.\n\nThis approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services\n\nCOST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.\nMATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.\nTRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?\n\nWe solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services.\n\nWe solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.\n\nAnother great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.\n\nThe key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.\n\nTechnical approach\n\nThe web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings.

Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.\n\nThe definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.\n\nThe definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.\n\nThe definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!\n\nCampaign suitability\n\nSince our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal supports the digital identity side of our business: To use the system, tutors/experts must be confident that they will grow a valuable reputation, and students/learners must trust the reputations they see. (Students can also grow a reputation in order to secure the best tutors.) This means that our network must be independently sybil-resistant (zoom recordings give us good access to data, but simple social network analysis might be enough), or we must partner with a complete digital identity solution like Atala prism. We are requesting $10k in funds to test both approaches to digital identity.\n\nWhy should Catalyst voters support this project?\n\nWhile the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good \"geek out\" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.\n\nWe think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common \"lack of developer buy-in\" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.\n\nMore information\n\nWe will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824. You can also contact us using the contact form on our website tutorchain.io.\n\nWe hope to earn your trust in this exciting experiment in decentralized grantmaking!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369840-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nExpanded Problem Statement\n\nMillions of people pay billions of dollars for housing each year across Africa. However due to the informal nature of both the local affordable housing sector and its customers, those consistently making payments are largely unknown. Despite contributing the largest proportion of their income to reliably pay for housing, not being able to prove this history prevents the majority of Africans from establishing reputations of trust used to gain access to other financial services. The informal nature also creates lack of transparency and data required to codify and legitimise this direct route of housing finance to attract funds from other sources.\n\nA Collaborative Approach\n\nThe Affordable Housing Company (Nigeria) and Casa Real (Mozambique) have partnered to help provide a solution to this problem, so that different perspectives from across the continent are taken into consideration. While we are both already delivering innovative solutions to allow more Africans currently excluded from the formal financial system, to access affordable housing through programs like lease-to-own, we would also like our customers (and those of our competitors) to benefit from the trust they establish through reliably paying for their housing.\n\nWhy Decentralised?\n\nThe unfortunate reality of economies in most African countries, means that long term stability is not certain. So while many landlords, housing or informal financing businesses may already be recording information about their customer's payment history, getting access to this information months or years into the future may be difficult if the customer moves or there are changes to the business or it ceases to exist. By recording payments on the Cardano blockchain that are associated with a customer's decentralised identity, the customer retains ownership of this information and can continue to access it in the future, regardless of whether the business they made the payments to is still operating.\n\nExpanded Solution Description\n\nOur proposed identity and payment tracking solution will be broken into two components, as follows:\n\nCustomer Facing - Mobile App\n\nMobile applications are accessible to most Africans and therefore a better option than providing access via a web browser. The following functionality will be implemented for the customer mobile app.\n\nCustomers create a decentralised identifier (DID) through Atala PRISM.\nCustomers enter their identity and contact information and submit an application to be considered for access to an affordable house through the lease-to-own program. NOTE: This information is not stored on the blockchain.\nCustomers can track the status of their application.\nSuccessful applicants can access their account information, such as payment history, amount outstanding, etc.\n\nBusiness Facing - Web App\n\nThe following functionality will be implemented for the customer account management application.\n\nBusinesses create a decentralised identifier (DID) through Atala PRISM.\nBusinesses review customer applications, submitted via the mobile app.\nBusinesses update the status of customer applications after assessing their eligibility.\nBusinesses issue a verifiable credential (a decentralised identity artefact) through Atala PRISM to successful applicants, after verifying the customer's identity using methods specific to their region (e.g. physical identity cards).\nBusinesses record payments received by customers, which are written to the blockchain against the customer's DID and updated in the mobile app.\n\nFuture Extensions\n\nAs adoption of the capabilities made available through this solution grows, additional features could be introduced to further improve the customer experience. Some examples are:\n\nDecentralised identities introduced through trusted housing development partners are able to be used by traditional funding institutions and on emerging decentralised finance platforms, such as Empowa.\nCustomer identities can be verified by other trusted institutions, such as local government agencies. As agencies see adoption for Decentralised Identity solutions, they may be driven to support this through the issuance of verifiable credentials.\nEvolve from tracking cash payments, to support for making payments using cryptocurrencies, such as ADA.\n\nApplication Ownership\n\nThis application will be developed as open source source software to allow other similar housing providers across Africa to leverage its capabilities for their customers.\n\nProject Timeframes & Budget\n\nThe estimated time to completion for this project is 3 months from Atala PRISM availability. The following budget breakdown is included to support the requested funding amount.\n\nProject Manager - 10 days: $5000\n\nBackend/Blockchain Developer - 20 days: $15,000\n\nFrontend/Mobile Developer - 40 days/week: $20,000\n\nTester - 5 days: $2,500\n\nTotal: $42,500","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370012-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n-\n\nIntroduction to Offsite Modular Construction of Housing which is \"Faster, Better, Cheaper & Greener!\"\n\n(Please watch the Video Below)\n\nThe fastest & most cost-effective way of building housing is offsite modular construction in factories, because production line techniques can be used & there are no delays for events like bad weather.\n\nBenefits of the Cardano Blockchain with modular construction.\n\nModular Housing Factories can be built anywhere in the world that has a housing shortage & needs employment, using a standard basic model we save money, then exterior & interior finishes will use local materials suitable for budgets and the environment.\n\nCardano Blockchain would control the materials supply-chain, transportation & assembly of the modules, each housing module can be held in an NFT, an NFT can be created for the plot of land and finally there would be an NFT that would record the marriage of the modules and the land in the package.\n\nThe land & building ownership would be held in an NFT and registered on the blockchain, there will be a tangible uplift in value as the parts are being put together and then the \"marriage-value\" of the modules with the land will create profits.\n\nHousing factories can be created all over the world, materials and pricing can be tailored to the local economy.\n\nReal time tracking will be displayed online to co-ordinate works in the factory and on the building plot of land to ensure a smooth installation on the day of delivery.\n\nBenefits of Offsite Modular Construction\n\nFaster – Quicker delivery\n\nThe Modules and pods can be installed on site in a matter of days for smaller homes and a few weeks for say a block of flats, the upside is obvious but I would highlight the number of lost working days with traditional building methods due to bad weather – this is not an issue with offsite modular construction particularly as the modules are normally weather proof on delivery.\n\nAs our buildings are constructed inside factories we are not effected by delays caused by bad weather, bad light or theft.\n\nBetter – Higher Quality\n\nAs the modules that make up our buildings, and the fitting out of them, is completed inside a factory the quality can be monitored more easily and quality control maintained.\n\nAlso as we primarily use steel to build our modular building units we can achieve millimeter accuracy in the construction and fitting out. This accuracy is maintained through the life of the building due to the higher strength of steel as our primary building material.\n\nCheaper - Lower prices\n\nMass production of standardised modular units and pods which are assembled on a production line basis will drastically reduce the overall cost, the reduced time for workmen to be on site is also a hidden cost benefit along with theft of materials and equipment which is identified as a significant cost with traditional building methods.\n\nGreener - Ecological & sustainable\n\nAs mentioned, before we can employ the very best recyclable materials and finishes which will be mounted on steel modular frames, these materials offer the best thermal resistance in both the heat and cold making the resulting home much better and efficient to live in.\n\nBetter water management\n\nDue to the flexibility of design, we are easily able to collect rain water and run it into a grey water management system which can be used to flush toilets etc. reducing the demand on the main water supply which in turn reduces costs to the home owner.\n\nEfficient use of utilities\n\nOverall, the above benefits will reduce the usage of heating & cooling within the home, it will allow the easier maintenance of the ideal ambient temperature. We can also add elements of solar power generation to reduce the reliance on external power sources. \n\nStandardisation\n\nThe modules are built with special module measurements with a steel frame to withstand shipping and strength requirements, manufacturing takes place in the factory.\n\nStructural integrity\n\nCurrently, the modules can be built up to 6 floors without additional structural support.\n\nDesign Flexibility\n\nOpportunity for different expressions, due to the modular elements you have a greater variety of optional layouts that are quickly implemented.\n\nEnvironmentally Friendly\n\nEnvironmentally friendly production as the materials and modules can be recycled after use and reused.\n\nEfficient Energy Solutions\n\nWell insulated using the most up to date efficient materials which are constantly reviewed. We can easily incorporate the very latest ecologically beneficial facilities such as solar power generation and grey water management, all installed in the comfort of our factory.\n\nSmart Technology & Internet of Things\n\nIt is much easier to incorporate WiFi, Solar panels, internet access wiring etc. in a factory setting.\n\nFulfills Planning Requirements\n\nThe modules are built according to national and local planning regulations resulting in stronger more durable buildings, new homes are also insured for up to 10 years.\n\nAdvantages of offsite manufacture for construction\n\n1. What are the opportunities offered by offsite manufacture for construction? What are the likely drawbacks? What factors are likely to influence clients, architects, design engineers, contractors and the supply chain in deciding whether to choose offsite manufacture?\n\na. OPPORTUNITIES: \"Deliverability\";\n\ni. Affordable residential housing\n\nii. Filling the UK housing shortage needs\n\niii. Providing jobs in highest areas of unemployment\n\niv. Positioning offsite factories where there are skilled people\n\nv. Better comfortable working environment for employees\n\nvi. Efficient production line techniques can be employed\n\nvii. Develop efficiency by standardisation of many elements\n\nviii. Robotics can be used to complete repetitive actions\n\nix. Potential to develop specialist factories as part of supply chain\n\nx. Just-in-time delivery schedules can be employed for materials\n\nxi. Bulk delivery of components and materials possible\n\nxii. Reduction of pollution due to less transport movements\n\nxiii. Factories can be positioned to take advantage of both road & rail\n\nxiv. Intermodal transportation can be used by designing to ISO sizes\n\nxv. Reduce negative impacts around building sites\n\nxvi. Certainty of development completion timescales\n\nxvii. Reduction of delays caused by bad weather\n\nxviii. Ground works completed at the same time as the building is built\n\nxix. Centralisation of components and materials\n\nxx. Inclusion of more recyclable & sustainable materials such as steel\n\nxxi. Opportunity to supply modules both B2B and directly B2C\n\nxxii. Websites can be created where people can \"design your own home\" and a full quotation automatically created (excluding the cost of land) and payment taken.\n\nb. The cost of a modular home does not vary because of the geographic final location, the only geographic variable is the cost of land.DRAWBACKS: \"Education\";\n\ni. Resistance by traditional (House) builders\n\nii. Resistance by the brick & slate industries\n\niii. Acceptance by the public\n\niv. Acceptance by the mortgage market\n\nv. Incorrect perception that this is lower quality construction\n\nvi. Memories of post-war \"prefab\" housing.\n\n2. Offsite manufacture of housing can lead to;\n\na. lower costs, faster delivery and increased quality;\n\nb. increased productivity;\n\nc. improved health and safety;\n\nd. greater provision of new, affordable housing.\n\nWhat is the evidence for this?\n\na. lower costs, faster delivery and increased quality; Generally through centralisation of labour and materials with reduced transportation of employees and materials. The key to faster delivery is that groundworks and the creation of the building take place in parallel resulting in a potential saving of 50% of the time required to complete. As all buildings are completed inside factories the conditions are totally controlled; heating, lighting and employee's facilities. With the availability of specialist equipment, leading materials available and production-line techniques the highest quality can be maintained.\n\nb. increased productivity; Due to the totally controlled working environment potential stoppages and downtime due to weather are eliminated also better working conditions leads to happier more productive workers.\n\nc. improved health and safety; Once again through the controlled working environments possible matters such as visibility is increased, errors caused by cold or wet hands avoided and systems and processes can be put in place more easily in a factory environment.\n\nd. greater provision of new, affordable housing; As our evidence is titled offsite modular construction of housing is: \"Faster, Better, Cheaper & Greener!\"\n\nGenerally taking 50% of the time, Higher quality in structural and thermal qualities, due to time saved, transportation reductions, reduced financing periods and quicker delivery to the open market a minimum of 25% can be saved which can be 'passed on' to the open market & local government (Only land value will fluctuate around the country).\n\nModular construction will allow a wider range of housing solutions, infilling on small sites (uneconomic for traditional builders), self-supporting housing using air-rights (over shops, commercial buildings, carparks), both temporary and permanent housing (Houses and flats) can be provided to suit special situations or local authority requirements. Land can be developed quickly and efficiently avoiding the requirement for land banking to create a \"pipeline\" of developable land.\n\nPotential barriers to wider use of offsite manufacture\n\n3. What are the drawbacks to offsite manufacture for construction?\n\na. We do not see any drawbacks to the efficiencies provided by this method of construction.\n\n4. What re-skilling of the construction workforce is required to facilitate a change to more off-site manufacture for construction?\n\na. A large part of the industry will have to get used to working inside in clean and efficient factories.\n\nb. The industry will have to get used to using new more efficient materials.\n\nc. Builders will become more technical and use more specialist tools and automated systems on production lines.\n\n5. Can the benefits of standardisation and factory manufacture be realised without hampering architectural ambition? If so, how?\n\na. Due to the wide range of construction materials and finishes architects will be more liberated and have a wider scope for design creativity.\n\nb. Many more ecological and energy saving technologies can be incorporated into the very fabric of the buildings, even becoming part of the structure.\n\n6. What R&D is needed, and by whom, to realise fully the potential benefits of off- site manufacture?\n\na. Entrepreneurs running private organisations will be the very best to develop this opportunity.\n\nb. Passion, dedication and competition within the market place will produce the best results.\n\n \n\nThank you for reading this proposal, I hope you see the need for a better approach to housing supply.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCarl Henry\n\nTo be Powered By: https://carlhenryglobal.com\n\nCarl Henry Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\n \n\nRoad Map - Overview\n\nThis project has been ongoing for some years, funding from Catalyst will help to accelerate the adoption and integration of the Cardano Blockchain and tokens.\n\nRoadmap - 3 Months\n\nBuild upon existing website assets and add in new functionality for quotations and specification.\nUpdate lists of suppliers and other housing manufacturers UK & Europe.\nUpdate worldwide data on housing needs and requirements.\nUpdate current modular designs and costing models with architects.\nNegotiate new supply contracts with existing manufacturers & suppliers.\nPrepare to launch a new Cardano Native Token for long term funding.\nScout potential manufacturing factory sites in UK & Europe.\nStart the translation of the website and documentation into key languages.\nPlanning of marketing campaign & initial rollout.\nManagement & team building.\n\nRoadmap - 6 Months\n\nUpdate lists of suppliers and other housing manufacturers worldwide.\nlaunch a new Cardano Native Token for long term funding.\nResearch potential sites for housing manufacturing in Africa and elsewhere.\nFinalise modular designs and costing models with architects.\nStep up the marketing campaign.\n\nRoadmap - 12 Months\n\nSetup the first manufacturing factory.\n\n \n\nSocial Media - Carl Henry Global\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CarlHenryGlobal\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/carl-henry-global/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/carlhenryglobal/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@carlhenryglobalsa/\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/CarlHenryGlobalsa/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/channels/871290918693658624/871290918693658627\n\nIdeaScale: https://carlhenryglobal.ideascale.com\n\n \n\nCardano IdeaScale - 27 Insights & 10 Projects Submitted\n\nCarl Henry Global is committed to working with the Cardano Ecosystem and working to improve it, if you would like to see our other submissions please visit our profile: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3097499-48088\n\n \n\nBudget Line Items (Phase 1 Development)\n\n$15,000.00 Website with design and specification software\n\n$8,000.00 Administration, data entry & Research\n\n$2,000.00 Translations\n\n$2,000.00 Consultation fees for launch of a Cardano Native Token\n\n$10,000.00 Marketing & social media costs\n\n$11,000.00 Content writing, publishing & posting\n\n$20,000.00 Architect update modular housing designs\n\n-","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370015-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370010-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations.

We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.\n\nThe definition of success after 3 months is a complete REST API with working wallet integration.\n\nThe definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.\n\nThe definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!\n\nCampaign suitability\n\nSince our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple campaigns. This proposal will support our efforts to customize Tutorchain for use in the Cardano ecosystem. Interacting with the Cardano community, we have repeatedly received the comment \"I would use the service if it existed!\" So we will try to bring it to you. The success of an expert marketplace relies on an initial critical mass of high-quality experts, good marketing to in-need learners, and good customer service to work out the kinks. We are requesting $15k to support these efforts. A successful tutorchain for Cardano will mean that new developers can quickly get the advice they need at an affordable price, and that existing developers can monetize their expertise. This will help grow the ecosystem.\n\nWhy should Catalyst voters support this project?\n\nWhile the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good \"geek out\" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.\n\nWe think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common \"lack of developer buy-in\" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.\n\nMore information\n\nWe will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824. You can also contact us using the contact form on our website tutorchain.io.\n\nWe hope to earn your trust in this exciting experiment in decentralized grantmaking!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369841-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370128-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n-\n\nWelcome! Thank you for visiting this proposal,\n\nThe objective is to get more developers building the ecosystem on Cardano, OK! Let's make it easy for them.\n\nLanguage barriers\n\nOne barrier to entry for Ethereum based developers is learning the Haskel Language, the answer would be to give the main code blocks for popular applications fully ready. This would allow the developers get a basic application up and running on the blockchain quickly.\n\nThen instructions could be given showing how to customise the user experience, look and feel.\n\nIf additional functionality is required, they could hire a Haskel/plutus developer to finish the work, which would be more efficient in time and finances.\n\nBasic Code Templates\n\nAs there are only so many application models it should also be possible to give complete basic templates for example stand-alone wallet, browser wallet DEX, NFT platform, retail point of sale, online checkout payments, smart contracts (with different features), stable coin etc.\n\nCustomisable platform\n\nAnother approach would be to create a foundation framework, like an open source content management system for websites, where modules could be uploaded to increase and add certain functionality.\n\nDeveloper Contracting Platform\n\nThe other way to build the number of applications operating on the Cardano blockchain is to create an easy way for people to contract with trained developers in the crypto space, some people have more money than time or skills.\n\nThese people may be very creative or recognise a problem to solve, so a platform similar to Upwork or Fiverr would facilitate the linkup and development of multiple ideas & projects.\n\nThe way forward\n\nI am happy to work on this with my team & contractors, work with others in the Cardano space or develop the foundation and then step behind a decentralise team. Let me get started building a team of like-minded individuals and then decentralise the operation for maximum efficiency.\n\nThank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCarl Henry\n\nTo be Powered By: https://carlhenryglobal.com\n\nCarl Henry Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\n \n\nRoad Map/Action Plan\n\nThis project is ready for immediate development, available to the public within 2 months. long term funding will be by launching the \"CHG\" Cardano native Token.

Before going to the implementation plan, we would like to present some reasons for Establishing Vietnam Technology Startup Club on the Cardano blockchain platform.\n\nAs international integration deepens, all products on the market face stiff competition from domestic and foreign competitors. It is extremely important to ensure goods of good quality, clear origin, and reputable brands, directly affecting competitiveness. And the search for technological solutions to help trace the origin as well as protect the brand quickly, accurately, etc. has become a trend in the manufacturing field in general.\n\nWe will never forget the painful lessons of Vietnamese agricultural products when being \"victims\" of \"brain thieves\".\n\nIn 2000, Trung Nguyen coffee had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get the domain name back in the US.\n\nIn 2008, Ben Tre coconut candy was branded stolen in China, causing export volume to plummet, from 900,000-1,000,000 tons/year to only a few tens of thousands of tons/year.\n\nIn 2011, Buon Ma Thuot coffee was registered for exclusive protection by China for 10 years in China, and was registered for exclusive protection by France in 10 other countries.\n\nIn 2011, Phu Quoc fish sauce was branded stolen in China, Thailand, Europe, and Australia.\n\nAnd most recently, right in this 2021, are the pressing concerns related to the ST25 rice brand that 5 US businesses and 1 Australian business applied to register for \"protection\" of the brand.\n\nThe ST25, the Trung Nguyen coffee, the Phu Quoc fish sauce... are the clearest proofs of the disadvantage of Vietnamese agricultural products.\n\nBut it also shows the weakness of enterprises when they do not know, or do not drastic in \"asserting themselves\", \"protecting themselves\" in the domestic as well as international markets.\n\n--> That is also the basis for us to help them find solutions based on Cardano in particular and Blockchain in general. For example, Traceability solutions and services for Vietnamese exports, or applications in the fields of Education and Health...\n\nTo do that, we should gather together into a Startup Club on the Cardano platform.\n\n5.2.

Part of my motivation is to better understand the core semantics of Plutus, and the other part is to provide a way to use the high performance actor model capabilities of the Pony programming language for applications on the Cardano platform.\n\nMy other proposals this round could benefit from this:\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Collaboration-Protocol/369937-48088#\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Elm-Integration-with-Plutus/370150-48088\n\nWorking on distributed collaboration would benefit from the types of simulations that are made easy with Pony's concurrency model, and the flexibility of Pony's type system. Pony also has lock-free memory safety and object capabilities that can protect different parts of a system from gaining access to functionality they shouldn't have.\n\nThe possibility of compiling Elm code to Plutus Core would open the door to tightly coupling frontend code with on-chain code, and integration with a highly scalable backend that's possible with this project.\n\nTimeline:\n\nThree Months: There are different ways to interface Pony with Plutus. My current thought is that writing a Plutus Core interpreter would be the most useful way to do this, but I'm open to suggestions. This would require expressing Plutus Core semantics in terms of the Pony type system, which is what I'd be spending the initial phase of this project working on. This would open the door to running Plutus code in Pony for use as a side chain, or generating Plutus code to be run on the main chain. I'll probably drop the Haskell implementation of the Plutus Core interpreter into my codebase to test against the output of the code I write. It's also possible that I could import the Haskell code as a library into Pony, which would probably be less work, but the current story of how to load Haskell code into a C-style FFI isn't ideal. I'm not sure about loading a Pony module into a Haskell codebase. The first phase of this project is about research and setting an optimal plan in place.\n\nSix Months: At this point, I should be well on my way to producing a library for interfacing Pony and Plutus! All the code and documentation that I write will be open source, and pushed to the git repository attached to this proposal. I'm open to any feedback and help that the community might want to provide.\n\nTwelve Months: Hopefully, there will be a working library that developers can use to add distributed stream processing and actor-based simulations to their Plutus applications... for side chains or off-chain code.\n\n(Depending on the acceptance of my other proposals, timelines would be subject to change, and I reserve the right to interleave work on each project as I see fit. Some of the research I do for the other projects could give direction to this one and vise versa.)\n\nI'm currently living in Malawi, in southeast Africa, and can easily live off of $1000 a month if I need to ($1000 * 6 months). The budget is for six months of work, beyond that, I'll probably just continue working on this project for free, because it will be useful for other things I want to do in the future. I've been living off of my savings in Ada since April and devoting most of my time to studying the Cardano platform and related topics. It would be nice to have an income besides bull runs in the price of Ada, so that I can focus on building free tools.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370089-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nUsing a combination of metadata and native assets, we will create a \"freelancers\": agreement based off a statement of work.\nThe contracts are already provided in solidity. \nA guarantee can also be included which protects the escrow/deposit should one party default.

Before going to the implementation plan, we would like to present some reasons for Creating Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide\n\nAt the end of September 2021 it is expected that we will activate Smart Contract. That will be the time to mark the landing of a series of projects running on the Cardano platform, contributing to the expansion of the ecosystem in the future.\n\nAnd the Catalyst Project is a very important part of the expansion of that ecosystem.\n\nBut, the results of the Cardano Vietnam community survey show: about 89% don't know how to evaluate and vote for Catalyst Proposals. In fact, not only the Vietnamese community, but many people in the Cardano communities around the world are also facing the same situation. The total circulating supply is about 32B ADA but only about 2.3B ADA (less than 10%) participated in the voting of Catalyst Fund4 Proposals (taking place from 15-25 June 2021). If we compare this to the election of The Council of the People's Deputies, then 90% of the population does not participate in the election.\n\nThis is really a big problem for the community as well as for the Catalyst project, but it is also the basis for us to create the \"Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide\".\n\nThe goal of the \"Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide\" is not to find projects and recommend the community to invest, but to help the community to evaluate proposals by themselves. That's what's best for the community, so they can move on their own later.\n\n5.2. Kế hoạch thực hiện:\n\n5.2.1. Month #1,2,3\n\n- Develop a set of evaluation criteria including: General Criteria and Specific Criteria (Dapps, Defi, DEX...)\n\n- Completing the \"Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide\" (Details of each job will be updated and added before October 7, 2021).\n\n- Deploy the \"Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide\" for at least 200 people.\n\n5.2.2.

This will build adoption and uptake around the world.\n\nWebsite Software\n\nWe need more applications that bridge between the Crypto/blockchain world and currently popular website software, that can be easily installed into Websites as components, modules or plugins.\n\nThese applications would bridge between PHP code and integrate the code required to talk to the Cardano Blockchain. They would be installed using the standard content management system installer.\n\nWebsite Creation & Website Builders\n\nApplications need to be built for Popular open-source Website Content Management Systems (CMS) like, Wordpress Drupal, Joomla and Magento, here are the approximate number of websites built on the top 10 Content Management Systems:\n\nWordPress 28,000,000\n\nWix 4,500,000\n\nProgress Sitefinity 3,100,000\n\nSquarespace 2,500,000\n\nShopify 1,800,000\n\nJoomla! 1,500,000\n\nGoDaddy Website Builder 1,500,000\n\nWeebly 1,000,000\n\nBlogger 632,000\n\nDrupal 588,000\n\nAs you can see there is a large existing market, which work on both computers and mobile devices, where digital payment systems will become required in growing numbers, with the speed and transaction volume of Cardano this will be a good selling point (pun intended!).\n\nUse cases\n\nApplications will be required for these main financial transactions carried out on websites:\n\nRetail payments - so the ability to pay with Cardano tokens at the checkout of an online store, this would require communication between the website component the block chain and of course the user's wallet.\n\nDonations - the ability to accept one-time payments, these may be carried out by offering simple buttons or as part of the checkout procedure.\n\nSubscriptions - Subscriptions would be used for membership sites, software as a service or maybe recurring donations.\n\nShopping Carts\n\nPayment solutions for a wide a wide range of shopping carts such as Virtuemart, WooCommerce, Opencart, Shopify HikaShop etc. can be written that seamlessly integrate Cardano digital payment facilities.\n\nWebsite Functionality\n\nIn addition to processing payments with Crypto, there are other applications that would be useful such as easy ways to use Blockchain to track stock, deliveries and even activities like recycling using bar codes or QR Codes.\n\nOur proposal is to develop a team within Carl Henry Global to build and distribute the necessary applications through the various repositories.\n\nRetail In-Person Point-of-Sale\n\nAs part of this proposal, we would start the research and preparation of plans to launch a viable payment processing method that could be used by retailers of all sizes.\n\nWe also envisage the acceptance of multiple Cardano Native Tokens, particularly if there are country specific tokens launched on the exchanges.\n\nUnbanked Retail Point-of-Entry\n\nWe will incorporate a facility for the unbanked to use retail shops, cafes etc. to convert their fiat currency into Cardano based tokens that can be used for remittances and online commerce.\n\nIf the user is buying items from the business, they will be able to \"over-pay\" with fiat currency, the over payment would be credited to their Cardano wallet. If local laws allow, we could also include a simple \"Cash-Converter\" facility where the retailer would get a fee for accepting fiat and crediting it to their wallet.\n\nWe would encourage participating retailers to also accept Cardano ADA and other native tokens for goods & services.\n\nThank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCarl Henry\n\nTo be Powered By: https://carlhenryglobal.com\n\nCarl Henry Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\n \n\nRoad Map/Action Plan\n\nThis project is ready for immediate launch, long term funding will be by launching the \"CHG\" Cardano native Token.\n\nCardano Native Token Created \"CHG\"\n\nLink: https://cardanoassets.com/9823f946d1ac791a9ffc4d04811d4fe39df1931560402d1b4b2a4527\n\n3 Month - Roadmap\n\nBuild a development team to create the initial application.\n\nAppoint administration, research & marketing personnel.\n\nFinalise research into existing point-of-sale solutions around the world.\n\nProduce a written plan & support documentation together with the development team.\n\nPrepare a marketing campaign in multiple languages for in-person & online sales.\n\nStart creating in-person & online versions to test.\n\nStart a marketing campaign in multiple languages to raise awareness & adoption.\n\nAlign outreach with the development of Cardano features & benefits.\n\n6 Month - Roadmap\n\nFinalise in-person & online versions of the software applications.\n\nEstablish an upgrade & new features roadmap for the software & applications.\n\nStart distributing the software applications through various platforms for online.\n\nStart approaching retailers to incorporate the facility and services (Target 100 Retailers).\n\nHeavily promote the use on content management systems (Target 1,000+ installs).\n\n12 Month - Roadmap\n\nUpgrade and add new features to the software & application.\n\nApproaching retailers to incorporate the facility and services (Target 1,000+ Retailers).\n\nHeavily promote the use on content management systems (Target 10,000+ installs).\n\n \n\nSocial Media - Carl Henry Global\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CarlHenryGlobal\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/carl-henry-global/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/carlhenryglobal/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@carlhenryglobalsa/\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/CarlHenryGlobalsa/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/channels/871290918693658624/871290918693658627\n\nIdeaScale: https://carlhenryglobal.ideascale.com\n\n \n\nCardano IdeaScale - 27 Insights & 10 Projects Submitted\n\nCarl Henry Global is committed to working with the Cardano Ecosystem and working to improve it, if you would like to see our other submissions please visit our profile: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3097499-48088\n\n \n\nBudget Line Items\n\n$30,000.00 Code & software development team\n\n$8,000.00 Administration, data entry & Research\n\n$2,000.00 Translations\n\n$10,000.00 Outreach, Marketing & social media costs\n\n-","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370143-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nSummary\n\nhttps://www.cornucopias.io\n\nCornucopias 'The Island' is a blockchain based play-to-earn, build-to-earn game where players own characters, land and other NFT (non-fungible tokens) based assets that have real-world value, all hosted in a fun and expanding metaverse (a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users).  It was inspired from Charles Hoskinson's video - \"The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\".\n\n'The Island' is split into a number of themed zones such as the 'Wild⋆West' zone, 'Farm Life' zone, 'Age of The Samurai' zone, etc where people of all ages can play a series of mini-games, getting lost in the play-to-earn ecosystem where they can earn real-world value as they explore and build in our safe and secure world.\n\nThe more creative players can design their own items such as coffee tables, beds and other household furnishings which can then be minted into an 'Island Blueprint' that other players can then buy, gather the materials, and then craft in-game into a brand new NFT. Once created, the crafter can play with the items in their virtual dwelling or sell them onto other players to enjoy or sell on again.\n\n'The Island' combines gaming with real-world commerce and gives opportunities for traditional and ecommerce companies to sell and promote their real-world brands, goods and services, to a hard to reach audience they have potentially never had access to before.\n\nAvailable worldwide, 'The Island' is built on the Unreal Engine 5 games engine which is compatible with the PC, mobile phone, games consoles and smart TV's, and will be powered, governed and be forever evolving thanks to a growing number of communities including blockchain, Unreal game developers, Voxel, 3D artists and modelers and general game enthusiasts.\n\nCreators and players will discover a new form of currency economics where they can create and trade their own NFT's in-game or on 3rd party marketplaces, and no longer will their purchased game assets be trapped inside a single game again.\n\nA disruptive gaming revolution is upon us and Cornucopias 'The Island' awaits everyone to come and join in the fun of changing gaming forever!\n\nCardano Background\n\nAs a member of the Original 50 Cardano Project Catalyst I have been active in the community and have been working on the Cardano network for over a year - I have successfully delivered a project in Fund 3 https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Smart-Contract-Plugin/333827-48088 and I am working on a project for Fund 4.\n\nKnowing the eco-system and community so well I formed a new company in January 2021 dedicated to writing a blockchain game on Cardano. Self-funded with 4 other Cardano pioneers to date we have been busy planning the game, building the team and putting together the Whitepaper and a series of demos to show the community how the game may work.\n\nCornucopias 'The Island' Game could not have been possible without Project Catalyst introducing me to Cardano however to date it has all been bootstrapped and has had no Catalyst funding.\n\nI want to continue to build Open Source software for the community to use alongside building the game, and if this project is successfully funded I will produce the following using members of the Plutus Pioneer courses to both help my project and to help others in the community to put their new skills to work.\n\n'The Island' is powered by NFT's as players build upon and own the land, characters items and real estate. The game will allow community members to own their own NFT shop and allow them to sell their NFT's.\n\nI therefore need Smart Contracts to help many transactions occur.\n\nThe first open source project I need Smart Contracts for is an NFT Auction House. This will be a key feature to help community members to auction their NFT's and in addition the software will be usable away from The Island to help others grow their own software companies.\n\nWhy gaming on Cardano?\n\nThere are so many reasons to build an NFT game on Cardano, don't look at the network in August 2021 look where it will be in August 2022. We will have:\n\n- lots of DeFi applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.\n\n- lots of NFT applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.\n\n- lots of Plutus developers we can offer full time jobs.\n\n- Atala Prism will allow us to verify players age which is really important to parts of the game and something no other Blockchain can offer.\n\n- Hydra will offer 1 million transactions per second\n\n- scalability and reliability is critical for a game that is aiming to attract 1m+ players\n\nWhat does success look like?\n\nSuccess will be judged on the games popularity and to date we are growing a very good reputation on social media and a lot of positive 'buzz' is happening around the game.\n\nWe are looking at bringing over 1 million gamers to the Cardano Network within the first 3 years of launch and are looking to recruit many people from inside the Cardano community.\n\nThe Play-to-Earn and Build-To-Earn features of the game will bring prosperity to gamers like never before and has the chance to change lives in many countries.\n\nWe have recently teamed up with an Education Centre that holds virtual lessons in Africa and the Learn-To-Earn aspect of the game will help that eco-system grow further.\n\nStake-To-Earn aims to simplify staking and yield farming using a gamification style interface.\n\nSuccess will also come in the form of recognition that Cardano is an amazing platform to build NFT Gaming on.\n\nWhat does the current team look like?\n\nI have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I started building the game alongside my full-time job in January and in July I went full-time working on the game - a huge leap of faith as I have no means of making an income until the game launches. Currently there are 9 members of the team.\n\nRob Greig – Founder\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-greig-2076b053/\n\nRob is a serial entrepreneur, building businesses and developing software for 20 years in various industries. Highly skilled developer and Business Analyst. Previously built an estate agent monitoring system and an advanced automated backend/cloud API business that was sold to one of the largest UK estate agent portals (Fish4) and media company 'Trinity Mirror'.\n\nExcels in software planning, development, management along with building and mentoring small to medium development teams.\n\nDelivery Team\n\nEveryone in my team will be working on Cornucopias 'The Island' game.\n\nIn addition - we will be recruiting on a contracting basis between 1 and 3 Plutus Pioneer graduates which is where the funds for this proposal will be mainly going towards.\n\nDevelopment Costs Estimate:\n\nDelivery:\n\nThe final game will take years to build however a series of Milestones will be achieved over the months to bring the game to life using the Agile delivery method, with the first Web Browser version available in Q1 2022.\n\nThis project is to fund Plutus Pioneer to convert our Cardano CLI NFT scripts into Smart Contracts and to build additional Smart Contract functionality.\n\nCosts:\n\n90% of the funds will be paid to Plutus Pioneer graduates and the rest will be used to integrate the Smart Contracts built into 'The Island' game.\n\nPlease see our White Paper and our website to find out more .. https://www.cornucopias.io/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370147-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nAll the progress I make on this project will be available in the linked git repository under an open source license.\n\nTimeline:\n\nThree Months: Some work on defining how Elm code could translate to Plutus. How can the Elm Architecture be adapted to the EUTxO model and interact with the different components of the Plutus library. \n\nSix Months: Some working code that either translates an Elm project into a compilable Plutus project, or that compiles directly to Plutus Core based on whichever path my research takes me.\n\nTwelve Months: People should be able to write their Plutus applications in Elm if they want to, and run them on Cardano. I'm hoping to, eventually, look at ways this project could be used in conjunction with my other proposals in this round:\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Plutus-Integration-with-Pony-Lang/370089-48088\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Collaboration-Protocol/369937-48088\n\n(Depending on the acceptance of my other proposals, timelines would be subject to change, and I reserve the right to interleave work on each project as I see fit. Some of the research I do for the other projects could give direction to this one and vise versa.)\n\nI'm currently living in Malawi, in southeast Africa, and can easily live off of $1000 a month if I need to ($1000 * 6 months). The budget is for six months of work, beyond that, I'll probably just continue working on this project for free, because it will be useful for other things I want to do in the future. I've been living off of my savings in Ada since April and devoting most of my time to studying the Cardano platform and related topics. It would be nice to have an income besides bull runs in the price of Ada, so that I can focus on building free tools.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370150-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nwww.DragonDefender.com developed over the past 10 months and has been undergoing lots of testing with real YouTubers, and is now what we would call at MVP (minimum viable product) level. https://www.dragondefender.com\n\nThe system is comprised of multiple backend nodes that are centrally controlled by a cloud service and presented to the users with a web frontend.\n\nThe independently running nodes scan an on-boarded white list of YouTube channels and using a comment matching algorithm (that has been fine-tuned over 10 months) detects and removes 95% of spam messages and 99% of YouTube channel imposter's messages.\n\nThe cat and mouse fight never stops\n\nDragon Defender is Google YouTube Compliant\n\nGoogle has been auditing our website and our tools to ensure we are using their Google YouTube API responsibly and have rewarded us with the Seal of Approval that means we can use their API with confidence.\n\nWe will continue to be audited and work with Google and together we will offer to our customers the fastest and most reliable service we can.\n\nDragon Defender History\n\nDragonDefender.com was built from seeing a video from Charles Hoskinson back in 2020 stating how much spam and imposters comments he was receiving on his YouTube channel.\n\nNow nearly a year on we have been building and testing the alpha then beta version and now monitor a selected number of Cardano based YouTube channels every 30 seconds and have deleted over 500,000 spam messages.\n\nThe biggest YouTube channel we look after has over 550k subscribers and has Cardano videos 3 or 4 times a week, we also look after other Cardano based channels that are growing at a fast pace such as:\n\n\"Kaizen Crypto\" (22k subscribers) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyf3zGnYK9jcF_mlRc_ztEA\n\n\"Cardano With Paul\" (53k subscribers) https://www.youtube.com/c/CardanoWithPaul\n\nProject Catalyst History\n\nI am proud to have been selected as part of the Founder 50 members in Fund 1 and my team and I have delivered the Fund 3 project https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Smart-Contract-Plugin/333827-48088 and are currently working on the Fund 4 project https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Code-Market-Plugin/341436-48088\n\nRoadmap\n\nPlease see our website for the latest roadmap\n\nhttps://www.dragondefender.com/roadmap.php\n\nCosts\n\nCosts will follow.\n\nWe have self-funded this project for almost a year and although we will continue to fund dragondefender.com to have real impact the infrastructure needs investment. We can only scale about 30 YouTubers with the current model.\n\nThe current design allows for an unlimited amount of nodes so scalability has been built in however we need to incentivize people to run a node. We therefore want to build a Host-To-Earn model where we can reward node hosts to help the system grow.\n\nAnother major milestone is to move away from the central cloud hosting to be completely decentralized. We know how to do this but need funds to build and test.\n\nIt is natural to offer multiple services to our customers and we have started to build and would like to continue building a similar tool for Twitter.\n\nWhat is success?\n\nSuccess will be for the system to be able to expand and help 100's of YouTube channels and other social media platforms to fight the Spammers and Imposters.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to keep the service free to all Cardano Community members that promote the blockchain on the many different social media platforms.\n\nIP\n\nUnfortunately the IP cannot be shared, if the spammer and imposters knew our secrets the service would not work. We are keen to make some elements open source and work with others to help build the tools, and we are exploring ways this can be achieved.\n\nWhat will the funds be used for?\n\nSome of the funds will be used to scale the project and pay for additional hardware resources and the remaining will go towards adding an additional member to our team that will help to develop the software further. The funds will only last 3 months at which point we will continue to fund the \"Free to Cardano Influencers\" project ourselves, but the funding will be vital in allowing the project to get off the ground successfully.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370151-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe Catalyst School is a place to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles.\n\nWe help onboarding and help improving the skills of:\n\nProposers\nCommunity Advisors\nVeteran Community Advisors\nGeneral new Catalyst members\n\nOur main proposal in Fund 5, with more details about the scope and goals of the Catalyst School, can be found here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School/367842-48088\n\nCurrent Problems and Limitations\n\nWorking closely with the Eastern TownHall, the Catalyst-school realized the high potential of the eastern community.

If you guys are willing to do that we can commit resources in two ways, several people that are on my security detail are former law enforcement I can certainly commit their time to assist in whatever group is formed, we also have cyber security experts at our firm, we can certainly commit some of their time there, and we also can commit money.

I am happy to work with other groups & organisations, input ideas to others or simply put this proposal out there for others to implement.\n\nBug Bounty Program\n\nI am aware of the HackerOne bounty program for Cardano Launched in August, learn more here: https://hackerone.com/cardano-foundation?type=team, if I understand this properly they are incentivising to identification of bugs in the existing live blockchain and the live eco-system.\n\nDisaster when all is at stake\n\nIf I understand this challenge correctly it is looking for ideas for the recovery of the Blockchain and to pro-actively identify potential problems before they go live (happy to be corrected in the comments).\n\nShadow Cardano\n\nMy proposal is to create one or more mirror, or shadow, Cardano blockchains, updated in real-time, that can run as \"virtual eco-systems\" where all types of tests can be carried out and scenarios tried with proposed or imagined applications.\n\nBackup & Restore\n\nOne or more of these copies can be held in reserve as backup versions of the entire Cardano Blockchain, a procedure to shutdown and restore the blockchain to be ready in case of a catastrophic event.\n\nWhy call it a \"War Room\"?\n\nIf you speak to any government they will quickly confirm that cyber warfare is a real and present danger, to protect Cardano we need to proactively engage with the digital enemies and take the fight to them before they can learning enough to damage our digital assets.\n\nOnly by having the correct mindset, which a war footing demands, will cyber threats and hackers be put on their back foot and be working more in a defensive fashion than an offensive fashion.\n\nLocation, Location, Location!\n\nThe Cardano eco-system must be monitored from more than one location, ideally from each continent and covering the most popular languages on that continent. Software must be developed to show everything being added to the blockchain in real time. It would be ideal to have a process where new applications submitted a notice to the war room so that potential threats could be headed off, although due to the decentralised nature of the blockchain this is something that needs to be discussed.\n\nBuild a knowledge base\n\nA database would be built up of all known or imagined threats, a bounty system can be expanded for ideas, operatives would stress test everything and quarantine potential threats or risks until clarified. Staying decentralised, final actions to be voted on for further action, unless it is a recognised threat or something potentially critical.\n\nThe wild west\n\nI think that we should be taking a frontier type mentality are so much in the digital space is unknown or unknowable until we see it appear before us. The basic system I am envisaging can be outlined with these colourful titles:\n\nSheriff - the sheriff would be a person in a management position who would have the final say on action to be taken against a scammer or a threat that has been reported via the deputies.\n\nDeputy - A deputy would be a person attached to, or working inside a war room who would be the first point of contact and who would analyse the scam or threat to create a report to be submitted to the sheriff for urgent and immediate action.\n\nBounty hunter - a bounty hunter would be a recognised individual or group of individuals who would be known to the war room and would work remotely seeking out scams and threats in the system, parts of the war rooms task would be to develop tools such as bots to identify anomalies, keywords and key phrases. The bounty hunters would also focus on certain countries and jurisdiction where scams and threats were found to be prevalent.\n\nGunslinger - Once a course of action has been decided upon, and the maximum intelligence has been gathered about the scammer or threat, the gunslinger would be a protected individual that would take the necessary action to close down the scam or threat. These gunslingers need to be protected individuals to ensure there were no repercussions or reprisals.\n\nAnd other parts of the war room's roll will be to develop close connections with all of the various platforms at management level in order to effectively close down scams once they have been identified.\n\nExample Scams\n\nI have personally noted give away ADA scams on telegram in the last seven days, I have used the available reporting facility to report each of these scams, the first one seems to have disappeared but the second one is still carrying on. I have also attempted to put posts with links to Charles Hoskinson's videos onto these channels but of course they are removed instantly by some type of bot, the other proactive way would be to find ways to contact the members of these sites to give them warnings and particularly the warning given by Charles Hoskinson \"we do not give away ADA\".\n\nThese are the scam channels:\n\n\"ADA Cardano Official\" 1592 Members (Seems to be stopped)\n\n28/08/21 Reported: Cardano do not give away ADA Tokens\n\n\"Cardano Official Commuinty\" 765 Members (was still operating 01/09/21)\n\nLink: https:// t.me/ Cardanotoken5\n\n28/08/21 Reported: Cardano do not give away ADA Tokens\n\n \n\nThank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCarl Henry\n\nTo be Powered By: https://carlhenryglobal.com\n\nCarl Henry Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\n \n\nRoad Map Overview\n\nThis project is ready for immediate launch, long term funding will be by proposals to Fund 7 & 8, also by launching the \"CHG\" Cardano native Token.\n\nCardano Native Token Created \"CHG\"\n\nLink: https://cardanoassets.com/9823f946d1ac791a9ffc4d04811d4fe39df1931560402d1b4b2a4527\n\n3 Month Roadmap\n\nCreate initial team to run & build ASTOP\n\nSetup social media & website for ASTOP\n\nEstablish links with the management of all social media.\n\nNegotiate to raise the problem with social media and reach agreements of action(s) & protocols.\n\nReach out to the community with information and recommended actions regarding stopping scams & threats.\n\nReach out to people with skills to create software solutions to scams & threats.\n\nReach out to establish war rooms to cover specific geographic areas and languages.\n\nStart building a database & intelligence gathering of known bad-actors and work to identify them, tracing funds, wallets.\n\n6 Month Roadmap\n\nOffer to work with other high profile individuals and businesses to protect them and create information sharing protocols.\n\nContinue to develop software solutions to root out and attack scammers.\n\n12 Month Roadmap\n\nThis will be an on-going and ever present threat that needs constant vigilance and effort, particularly as cryptocurrencies are adopted increasingly around the world.\n\n \n\nSocial Media - Carl Henry Global\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CarlHenryGlobal\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/carl-henry-global/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/carlhenryglobal/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@carlhenryglobalsa/\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/CarlHenryGlobalsa/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/channels/871290918693658624/871290918693658627\n\nIdeaScale: https://carlhenryglobal.ideascale.com\n\n \n\nCardano IdeaScale - 27 Insights & 10 Projects Submitted\n\nCarl Henry Global is committed to working with the Cardano Ecosystem and working to improve it, if you would like to see our other submissions please visit our profile: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3097499-48088\n\n \n\nBudget Line Items\n\n$3,000.00 Website to educate people and expose scams\n\n$5,000.00 Administration, data entry & Research\n\n$2,000.00 Translations\n\n$4,000.00 Outreach, Marketing & social media costs\n\n$6,000.00 Anti scam developers\n\n-","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370072-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370074-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370077-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n.\n\nGlossary\n\nCooperativa is understood as a decentralized model where membership is open and voluntary; control is executed by P2P democratic processes; benefits are shared through income, participation; education, autonomy and independence; balancing the power of members for a strong commitment taken towards the community.\n\nLocal means a territory composed of both digital and physical resources where nearby people interact according to specific needs and expectations that cannot be reduced to a global framework. Physical spaces are shared by multiple people identified by different communities.\n\nCooperativa Local was founded as a collaborative intention to serve various creative and entrepreneurial communities in Chile, Latin America and beyond; through a Hub website for Local NFTs, as well as P2P educational phygital instances that support the local adoption of various uses for NFTs and DAO.\n\nDAOOH is an acronym we academically propose for \"Decentralized and Autonomous Organizations through Out-of-Home digital displays\". A year from now, into Cardano's era of Basho (scaling) and together with you (other F6 projects).. Cooperativa Local will integrate DAO capability to both its website for minting diverse local NFTs and its OOH infrastructure: 50 recycled digital displays, installed by local communities at public spaces of Chile... Through which they will be able to broadcast their multiple NFT contents and uses; empowering local people by enhancing their access to Cardano, expression, commerce, education and coordination towards the local common good.\n\n \n\nOur first invitation to Cardano Community and every F6 project:\n\nThe following 4th of September, you are formally invited to participate on Chile's first public NFT & DAOOH event, where Cooperativa Local will be leading educative activities to lead the adoption of NFT contents and uses; as well as broadcasting local NFTs to the public.\n\nUpdate: we hosted 120 guests; 100 of which participated passively on our intervention, while 40 did it actively (by interacting with the UX or asking questions. By the end, 20 registered as collaborators of Cooperativa Local and will be available for leading activation efforts on their localities. 10 already created their first NFTs. Have a look at these and the whole live experience on our (alpha) website https://cooperativalocal.org/\n\nSend us a message if you'd be interested to participate on further events; to share (or test) your proposal with chilean citizens!\n\n \n\nProblem\n\nNowadays, NFTs are being validated in global markets. In Cardano's Blockchains they are more accessible than Ethereum's, however, the adoption of everyday applications face -at least- the same exposition and advertising barriers as other traditional contents. Moreover, NFT and Blockchain technologies requiere knowledgeof concepts, interfaces, cryptocurrencies and uses that can be specific for each individual.\n\nBecause of this, the learning curves are particularly steep in Chile and Latin America, resulting in a very slow adoption in the Region. We calculate that less than 200 chileans have minted NFTs.\n\nIn terms of advertising costs for chileans; here, 75% of small and medium businesses depend on the local influx of customers; their target audience. However, only 17% can afford digital or outdoor advertising (OOH); this means that more than 80% close before functioning 3 years. Yearly losses exceed $500 million dollars.\n\nThe reason for the high cost of promoting in a locality is that advertising markets are overly-concentrated by corporations and social networks (73% portion) that do not mind whether who pays its advertising service is an international company (non-local) or a small self-managed local initiative; advertising and exposition market prices are unattainable for the vast majority of world's society.\n\nThis dynamic affects in an even worse manner local initiatives that do have a proven positive impact on the quality of life of communities and their people, such as artistic, cultural, health, recreational, educational, democratic, etc. Thus, losses are difficult to quantify and invaluable in terms of access to a better quality of life provided by diverse local initiatives.\n\n \n\nSolution\n\nOur model recognizes that within each locality there are different issues and inspirations, which NFTs can serve in different appropriate ways. These differences do not only exist within each locality, but also between different localities. In the same way, each particular use for NFTs implies distinguible activation strategies at each location.\n\nTaking into consideration that an important part of the learning curve lies in the difficulty to conceptualize the technology and its daily applications; the education and visualization of practical uses is a vital part of the average citizen adoption process.\n\nThus; altogether we will:\n\n(A) Frequently execute physical and digital participative events; where -in coordination with local collectives throughout Chile- educating about NFT uses and hows; activating our country from within its localities.\n\n(B) Launch a Hub website for Local NFTs where people can promote their NFTs -already published on diverse NFT infrastructures, such as Cardano's- and learn about more of its uses. Letting users to sort the NFTs by territory and community, as well as an interactive map of the territory that displays NFTs, activators, creators, collectors, communities and businesses. \n\nThem, altogether, will share participative functionalities such as voting initiatives and commenting: enabling a more meaningful development of the local NFT ecosystems and wider variety of inspirations around which to co-create collectively; initiating DAO community-testing. Alpha version: https://cooperativalocal.org/\n\n(C) Broadcast these NFT contents (and uses) to physical localities in which we coordinate educative events. These instances will progressively be executed at emblematic physical public venues, where we aim to install permanent digital displays (OOH) for exclusive NFT contents from the Local people, businesses, communities and creators. It has been demonstrated that common spaces such as the main streets serve identity purposes that are broader than 'art'; thus, uses of NFT will sprout intensively in these local-focused contexts where NFTs are tangible and eloquent to the surrounding identities and contingency. Promoting regeneration, tourism and well being that could be valuable for citizens and authorities.\n\nThe installation of OOH will start with the use of recycled TVs and monitors and will also serve as educational and activation totems for local uses of NFTs and ADA; while also promoting the other F6 proposals under developing. Yes, we are together on this.\n\n(D) Provide collaboration, testing, activation and consultancy services to NFT projects and companies willing to learn from the chilean market; which can be interpreted as representative to the rest of Latin America and countries with slow adoption of ADA, NFT and Blockchain.\n\n \n\nFunding and expenses: Our Cooperative model let us to collaborate and gain multiple high-qualified capabilities for our roadmap, in low-cost fashion. The $14.000 F6 funds we are requesting will only be used -over 9 months- to:\n\n(1) Support the coordination and execution of 88 physical -and digital- activities at chilean localities, which will emancipate Cardano and NFT knowledge of use. As well as the installing costs for our OOH (88 recycled TVs) infrastructure.\n\n(2) Pay certified guidance for our team of developers into the path of gaining the following blockchain capabilities: IPFS, NFT (minting and listing) and DAO (specifically: community governance and democratic curation of contents to broadcast through our DAOOH displays at public spaces).\n\n(3) $500 per each one of the 9 months, to insure the project stability, liable to unexpected situations of urgency.\n\nFunding needed for further developments and capabilities will be raised from our service earnings and local co-funding, both from individuals, communities and local governments (without rights)\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nFirst Phase (September - December, 2021): $ 3.500\n\nWe publicly launched our website on September 4th: a digital infrastructure where chileans -sorted by locality and community- are be able to collaborate, learn, promote their NFTs and gain tools to become an activator for their surrounding peers and territory.\n\nIn that day -as in the following 3 months- Cooperativa Local lead (together with cultural and entrepreneurial communities of Chile) a physical-digital event to promote the knowledge, minting and uses of NFTs.. what may be the first public NFT broadcast at Chile.\n\nOn these first 3 months, the 4 major cities of Chile will welcome 8 physical events and 16 online activities; aiming to achieve 150 direct activations (users who mint an NFT on ADA) and 100 P2P (guided by their peers members of Cooperativa Local, using educative resources we will publicly share). On each of the 8 corporeal activities, the NFT contents will be broadcasted using OOH.\n\nBy the time we accomplish this period, Cooperativa Local website will be already displaying 300 NFTs minted exclusively on Chile, using diverse providers such as www.artano.io (when it's publicly launched) or hicetnunc.xyz. Both of these would be chosen because of their low fees.\n\nAlso, we aim to collaborate with at least 3 F6 projects in testing and activation campaigns. This way, we will continue developing a standard methodology to provide adoption-services for other NFT projects, that would be paid in the future.\n\n \n\nSecond Phase (January - April, 2022): $5,500 + Local Government Funding I\n\nHaving defined -on the latter phase- the foundations for our 'Activation strategy for Local NFT uses and contents' (capable of adapting to different territorial needs and collectives), in the next following 3 months we will target to replicate activities in each one of the 16 Regional capitals of Chile. Reaching 500 direct activations and 500 P2P.\n\nFor this phase, broadcastings of NFTs uses and contents will continue to happen to the different events. At least 8 will be in public spaces and 4 become permanently installed. The latter will require we to gain a new functionality on our website, where participants would be able to vote which contents they prefer to promote publicly to these places; in real time. This will serve as a test for practical uses of DAO functionalities in public chilean territory: DAOOH.\n\nBy the time we accomplish this period, Cooperativa Local website will be already displaying 1.000 NFTs minted exclusively on chilean localities.\n\nAt the end of this second phase, we aim to hit the milestone of having provided services (testing, consulting and activation campaigns) to 5 projects developing on this Catalyst F6; ending up with our first paid consultancy, testing and activation service for an  NFT business willing to execute successful activation campaigns on Chile or other similar countries, such as Latin America.\n\n \n\nThird Phase (May - August, 2022): $5.000 + Our Services Income+ Local Government Funding II\n\nFor this phase; we expect to accelerate our activation rate, as the local NFT ecosystem would have been already enhancedenough to concentrate on the P2P activation campaigns.\n\nThus, we will lead local physical-digital events -coordinated with collectives from these localities- on the least adopting regions of Chile. In sum, 32 events would have occurred and 88 public spaces will celebrate their first permanent OOH installation for local promotion and adoption of NFTs contents and uses. We appeal to have reached 1.000 direct activations, 3,000 P2P andpromote at least 2.000 chilean NFTs in our website Hub.\n\nCooperativa Local would need to provide paid consultancy and activation services to 3 NFT companies, and to attain the final milestone of the third phase, will publicly launch our Cooperative NFT model at another Latin American country; ideally, the one with the least developed NFT ecosystem: experience that will enhance a path towards Africa as a potential region of great impact.\n\n \n\nFourth Fase (September +, 2022): Our Service Incomes + Local Government Funding III\n\nA year into the path of Cooperativa Local: activated users, collectives, businesses and the Cardano/F6 Community -from Chile and the other recently-activated Latin American countries- will altogether celebrate the launch of a NFT Marketplace for Local minting, uses and contents.\n\nThe platform will allow that NFT contents and its discovery is differentiated by locality, community and type of user: either it is a person, a collective, a NFT company or a local participative initiative.\n\nThe latter infrastructure would require DAO and NFT-Social Tokenization, through which locals will be able to valuate the  contents; dynamic that will organically define which NFTs should be broadcasted to the public spaces of each activated locality.This DAOOOH milestone will allow Cooperativa Local to offer a broader democratization of the development process of any locality.\n\nThe possibilities after gaining the infrastructure cited could also serve to provide wellbeing phygital platforming for communities that share public and private spaces such as parks, institutions, avenues, touristic places, public transport, cultural centers, stadium, schools, neighbourhoods.. possibilities that would be greatly valued for them and the public and private authorities that control those spaces, but that find themselves on a need to regenerate their relationship with their fellow citizens in meaningful ways.\n\nThese new NFT opportunities will animate the global paradigm of which contents people use NFTs for, evolving from 'art' to social interaction, coordination and expression in general: opening a path for migrating Massive Social Media Corporations.\n\nThe path of Cooperativa Local aims to empower anywhere communities and everyday citizens while emancipating -together with Cardano- the democratization of societies' expression and collectively chosen paths to approach past, present and future.\n\n \n\n \n\nWe are a growing Cooperative, already collaborating with 30+ locals collectives and individuals;  desiring to join forces with every F6 Team!\n\nGon: Blockchain and Cooperative Businesses.

DeFi now has lots of useful applications that are now being used by a growing number of people.\n\nOn the health side, however, progress has been a bit slow given the challenges. For example, on top of building one's app, one has to consider regulatory compliance, data security, interoperability, and much more which could be time-consuming to do.\n\nBut if there is an existing decentralized Healthcare Infrastructure and Platform integrated with Cardano that devs can utilize, this could accelerate more health apps development. Developers can focus on building their health apps on top of the platform, saving months and even years of dev time.\n\n \n\nBut building a Healthcare Infrastructure takes years to build!\n\nRight, that is correct. Fortunately, we have started building this healthcare platform called HAPI Hub (short for Healthcare API Hub) since 2016. You can check its comprehensive API services at www.hapihub.com.\n\nIn addition, we also built frontend applications like Electronic Health Records (EHR), Laboratory and Radiology Information Systems, and other health modules. It's called HAPI Cure (also known as www.mycure.md).\n\n \n\nIf they are already built, what else needs to be done?\n\nWe plan to further enhance HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure by integrating them in Cardano Blockchain, which adds more security and immutability, enhancing the platform furthermore. This integration module will be called HAPI Chain.\n\nIn our estimation, HAPI Chain will take about 8 to 12 weeks to complete.\n\n \n\nHow is it different from other healthcare apps In blockchain?\n\nWell, aside from its already existing HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure platform, it will utilize the significant developments in Zero-Knowlege (zk) proof, a cryptography protocol, where prover (A) can prove that A knows information X to a verifier (B) without sharing any other knowledge to B other than that A knows X. Having this will address the limitation on scalability, privacy, and auditability.\n\n \n\nWhy is the project called HAPI DAO?\n\nHAPI DAO consists of the three aforementioned products - HAPI Hub, HAPI Cure, and HAPI Chain. It will adapt the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, popularized and proven to be effective by the likes of MakerDAO and Uniswap. Doing so will help achieve a truly decentralized organizational setup on top of the decentralized ledger provided by the Cardano blockchain.\n\nWith such in place, the direction of the organization is directed by the right intentions of the community and not by a central figure. This is especially important for projects like this dealing with people's health records which require utmost security, privacy, and accountability.\n\n \n\nSo, what are practical applications?\n\nSecurity & Compliance. Around the globe, there are thousands of health facilities (clinics, health centers, hospitals) that are using Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Many of which are not secure and compliant, meaning the health information of patients is at risk of exposure. HAPI DAO can help in this regard.\n\n \n\nAvailability of Solutions. Many of the health facilities don't even have their own medical records system. HAPI Cure already has available solutions like EHR, LIS, RIS, and other health modules that they can use.\n\n \n\nHealth App Development. If one is building a health app, there is a high chance it would need a module for user health records storage. Instead of doing this from scratch, it can utilize HAPI DAO's comprehensive API services instead without worrying about data security and compliance.\n\n \n\nStandards & Interoperability. Existing systems of health facilities have different providers, meaning they are built differently. Integrating HAPI DAO will make it interoperable with other systems as it follows industry-standard protocols. Imagine a whole town, city, or even a nation's health systems interconnected.\n\n \n\nHealth Information Exchange. A truly decentralized and secure HIE remains elusive, even for advanced countries. But putting Cardano technology + ZK proof with HAPI DAO could ultimately be the holy grail the healthcare industry has long been wanting to achieve. (One great example of this is the Vaccine Passport providers which can use this as a central exchange for validation. In doing so, there would be fewer if no apprehensions at all about data security and privacy.)\n\n---------------------------\n\nFor more details of the idea, a draft of the Decentralized, Secure, & Trustless Health Infrastructure and Information Exchange Platform can be found in this link:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lO6WsUjTzm0x0f2ioK-DsPnB5h1lyMBvnhtQr3gvirI/edit?usp=sharing","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370247-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370248-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nEverstake is ready to create many educational materials about Cardano and distribute them among our customer base.

Currently our social channels (Telegram and Facebook) include and inform more than 4000 Vietnamese community members about cardano and catalyst related news and content. One of our main goals is to include the Vietnamese community into project catalyst and to become part of a diverse and global community. Some very first steps in regard to including Vietnamese stakeholders in project catalyst, is to offer some easy tools with which the Vietnamese community can be included in the catalyst process.\n\nOne of these tools is presented in this proposal and we hope to get your support for our mission. providing tools and access to Vietnamese people to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nRounds of review\n\nTo evaluate submitted proposals in project Catalyst, the process includes 2 separate stages: 2MIN and DETAIL. Each stage consists a different goal.\n\nStage 1: 2MIN review\n\nEveryone can review the proposals within 2 minutes to determine if the proposals are ready to run or not. A proposal that should be funded is:\n\nThe team members are\n\n(1) identifiable,\n(2) interactive,\n(3) carefully prepared for a clearly, and detailed plan.\n\nThe Vietnamese Catalyst voting community will evaluate all proposals on based on 3 criteria:\n\nProfile of members\nActivities of members\nDetailed plan\n\nThis round does not require a profound knowledge about blockchain and cryptocurrencies nor a high level of English language skills. The main task focus on the proof of following criteria:\n\nDoes the Proposal owner(s)\n\nPublish their profile - YES/NO\nInteracts with the community - YES/NO\nWell prepared their proposal - YES/NO\n\nStage 2: DETAIL review\n\nVietnamese Community advisors will evaluate the proposals which gain more than 3 scores in the 2MIN review stage based on 5 criteria:\n\nProblem statements\nSolution\nTeam's background\nMilestones\nBudget plan\n\nReward for CAs\n\nWhat is EP score?\n\nEP means experience power score, the proof of\n\nUsed as a parameter to calculate 2MIN average score and DETAIL average score.\n\nBased on the reliability assessments of the 2MIN round.\n\nEach of your Primary scores that deviate by less than 30% from the Detailed Score Average is considered a reliable assessment.\n\nFor example: A proposal with an average score of 2MIN stage equals 3. If your 2MIN score between 2.1 and 3.9, then you get 1 reliable assessment.\n\nEP levels:\n\nEP=1: achieve 0-100 reliable assessments.\nEP=2: achieve 200-300 reliable assessments.\nEP=3: achieve 300-500 reliable assessments.\nEP=4: achieve 500-800 reliable assessments.\nEP=5: achieve more than 800 reliable assessments.\n\nWhat is AR score?\n\nAR means activity result score\n\nUsed as a parameter to calculate reward for CAs, vCAs.

DeFi now has lots of useful applications that are now being used by a growing number of people.\n\nOn the health side, however, progress has been a bit slow given the challenges. For example, on top of building one's app, one has to consider regulatory compliance, data security, interoperability, and much more which could be time-consuming to do. \n\nBut if there is an existing decentralized Healthcare Infrastructure and Platform integrated with Cardano that devs can utilize, this could accelerate more health apps development.  Developers can focus on building their health apps on top of the platform, saving months and even years of dev time.\n\n \n\nBut building a Healthcare Infrastructure takes years to build!\n\nRight, that is correct. Fortunately, we have started building this healthcare platform called HAPI Hub (short for Healthcare API Hub) since 2016. You can check its comprehensive API services at www.hapihub.com. \n\nIn addition, we also built frontend applications like Electronic Health Records (EHR), Laboratory and Radiology Information Systems, and other health modules. It's called HAPI Cure (also known as www.mycure.md).\n\n \n\nIf they are already built, what else needs to be done?\n\nWe plan to further enhance HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure by integrating them in Cardano Blockchain, which adds more security and immutability, enhancing the platform furthermore. This integration module will be called HAPI Chain. \n\nIn our estimation, HAPI Chain will take about 8 to 12 weeks to complete.\n\n \n\nHow is it different from other healthcare apps In blockchain?\n\nWell, aside from its already existing HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure platform, it will utilize the significant developments in Zero-Knowlege (zk) proof, a cryptography protocol, where prover (A) can prove that A knows information X to a verifier (B) without sharing any other knowledge to B other than that A knows X. Having this will address the limitation on scalability, privacy, and auditability.\n\n \n\nWhy is the project called HAPI DAO?\n\nHAPI DAO consists of the three aforementioned products -  HAPI Hub, HAPI Cure, and HAPI Chain. It will adapt the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, popularized and proven to be effective by the likes of MakerDAO and Uniswap. Doing so will help achieve a truly decentralized organizational setup on top of the decentralized ledger provided by the Cardano blockchain.\n\nWith such in place, the direction of the organization is directed by the right intentions of the community and not by a central figure. This is especially important for projects like this dealing with people's health records which require utmost security, privacy, and accountability. \n\nSo, what are practical applications?\n\n \n\nSecurity & Compliance. Around the globe, there are thousands of health facilities (clinics, health centers, hospitals) that are using Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Many of which are not secure and compliant, meaning the health information of patients is at risk of exposure. HAPI DAO can help in this regard.\n\n \n\nAvailability of Solutions. Many of the health facilities don't even have their own medical records system. HAPI Cure already has available solutions like EHR, LIS, RIS, and other health modules that they can use. \n\n \n\nHealth App Development. If one is building a health app, there is a high chance it would need a module for user health records storage. Instead of doing this from scratch, it can utilize HAPI DAO's comprehensive API services instead without worrying about data security and compliance.\n\n \n\nStandards & Interoperability. Existing systems of health facilities have different providers, meaning they are built differently. Integrating HAPI DAO will make it interoperable with other systems as it follows industry-standard protocols. Imagine a whole town, city, or even a nation's health systems interconnected. \n\n \n\nHealth Information Exchange. A truly decentralized and secure HIE remains elusive, even for advanced countries. But putting Cardano technology + ZK proof with HAPI DAO could ultimately be the holy grail the healthcare industry has long been wanting to achieve. (One great example of this is the Vaccine Passport providers which can use this as a central exchange for validation. In doing so, there would be fewer if no apprehensions at all about data security and privacy.)\n\n \n\n \n\n---------------------------\n\nFor more details of the idea, a draft of the Decentralized, Secure, & Trustless Health Infrastructure and Information Exchange Platform can be found in this link:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lO6WsUjTzm0x0f2ioK-DsPnB5h1lyMBvnhtQr3gvirI/edit?usp=sharing","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370215-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n#######################\n\n#What is an API service about?\n\nFor developers to build dapps, wallets, NFT marketplaces, etc, they require to query the Cardano blockchain. This is currently done via a database syncing tool called db-sync. The developers have to run their own infrastructure for this and that they end up wasting a lot of time on infrastructure than the actual product. An API service provides serverless highly scalable APIs for the developers to use and build apps without relying on their own backend systems.\n\n \n\n#What can a developer do with this service?\n\nDevelopers can build pretty much everything on Cardano using this API service, some common applications range from implementing pool updates on their website to, bots, etc.\n\nThis API service would also allow developers to submit transactions on the network. This will be a backbone for the new smart contract era on Cardano, that developers will be able to use this service to build swap, dex, etc. This can also be a great service for a wallet backend, which will allow many developers to build Cardano wallets without worrying about the infrastructure. So to summarise, major use cases are as below,\n\nDexes\nSwaps\nWallet Backends\nADA Payment Gateways\nNative Asset Metadata and queries\nNFT marketplace listing APIs\nAnalytics dashboards\nSmart contracts metadata APIs\nTelegram bots\nPool tracking tools\n\n \n\n#Is there a similar service?\n\nThere is a service for a similar use case, Blockfrost.

We recognize Self-Sovereign Identity, Verifiable Credentials, and public blockchains like Cardano as being fantastic tools to empower developing populations including in Africa and Asia to become more successful, even in the face of the agents of corruption around them.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nVerifiers must be convinced of a subject's. Identity, based on what they hold, know, and who they are. The \"who\" is often missing.\n\nProving who you are and the credentials you've earned over your lifetime is essential to empowerment. However, the ability to prove these things is sometimes fragile when paper credentials are lost or when it is difficult to prove who you really are while just a smartphone.\n\nTo create an ecosystem for digital identity and credentials requires trust relationships between credential issuers, subject, holders, verifiers, and governing authorities. Establishing trust is actually harder than just deploying the technology. From a credential holder's perspective, e.g., the one who has an Atala PRISM wallet, they need to prove to a verifier they really are the credentials recipient subject.\n\nSolution\n\nBiometrics help one prove their identity. An Identity Binding Credential will link an individual's DID and their biometric template.\n\niRespond is one of many centralized biometric service providers (BSPs) who can provide a strong level of assurance that an individual holding and presenting their credentials to a verifier is indeed the subject of the credential. IRespond's UNiD Node application already in production and deployed in Thailand, Myanmar, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, and other locations provides reliable identification of individuals based on a scan of their irises. We reliably produce a 12-digit unique numeric identifier (UNiD) for each individual that can be reliably used within other systems for healthcare, study tracking, work permits, and more. iRespond's solution doesn't track traditional PII attributes such as name, birth data, government ID, or address.\n\nWith this proposed project, the product will be extended to be able to produce an identity binding verifiable credential once an individual has had their irises scanned and after receiving a proof-of-DID-ownership (e.g., by signing a message with one of the keys listed in the DID Document). The credential would be similar to this: \"IRespond and the Operator X attest that the individual with UNiD 123456789012 and did:cardano:addr1xyz appeared live and was identified with dual iris scan with extremely high confidence (with supporting false accept rate and false reject rate).\"\n\nThis Identity Binding VC would be issued to the DID holder with a QR code and could be imported into the Atala PRISM wallet for later presentation, adding trust, especially when the verifier can also utilize iRespond's UNiD Node to prove the individual's UNiD identifier.\n\nServices could be built on top of that basic VC to also attest/notarize existing government-issued documents.\n\nMany biometric service providers will be able to play in this ecosystem to accelerate the mass-scale adoption of Atala PRISM DIDs and VCs. Individuals, governments, and companies will not be vendor-locked. Nor BSP identity provider will have a treasure trove of PII. This is completely unlike India's Aadhaar!\n\nAddressing the Challenge Question\n\nWhat will drive mass-scale adoption of decentralized IDs on Cardano?  Biometric Identity Binding Credentials will help establish trust between the roles within an SSI ecosystem, especially between a verifier and a holder when the stakes are high, such as with property/real estate transfers or guardianship scenarios.\n\nMilestones\n\n3 months - Pilot deployment of 5 iRespond UNiD Nodes into an existing Cardano project, e.g. in Ethiopia schools.\n\n6 months - Identity binding credentials issued and read by Atala PRISM.  Public launch, assuming Atala PRISM features are public by then.\n\n12 months - Solution deployment in pilot extended to end-to-end use cases of trusted issuers, holders, verifiers, and governance authorities.  Additional deployments within India and SE Asia.\n\nBudget\n\n$30,000 for product development (mostly staffing)\n\n$20,000 for pilot equipment, licensing for 5 years, and training\n\n$25,000 for staff and travel consulting with other issuers, verifiers, and governance authorities, including developing trust framework and registries, if needed.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369821-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nI am Rong Nguyen, Director of IAM Software Viet Nam\n\n  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rongnguyenkhac\n\n  - Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rong-nguyen-0103a362/\n\n(We are providing some products and services in Viet Nam)\n\nEnterprises need Infrastructure to operate, verify each other(partner) and make the world flatter!\n\nWe have one ERP solution and we want to bring it to Cardano and go global.

People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do (today only in fiat). (see \"Illustration 1).\n\nBig picture explanation of the current proposal . We are developing an umbrella concept with the code name \"Metronome\" which is based on the idea of empowering individuals with granular control within different data scenarios and relationship archetypes. These features will involve providing clear consent about the channel preference, cadence, and type of communication allowed between organizations (whether being brands, companies, or other kinds of organizations), In short, it enables individuals to have full control over the flow through the \"pipes\". These explicit preferences will be controlled by individuals across all of their scenarios and relationships or more granular per brand or industry. These preferences will be captured by utilizing translation metadata to ensure that the scope and details of these preferences are captured and enforced.\n\nSuccess after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be the developed POC for this smart contract. Success after 6 months would be the integration of this smart contract POC into our existing app and first test with our existing customer. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of the POC, used for each data subscription.\n\n \n\nNow let's move on to our actual detailed proposal (!):\n\n \n\n1.   Transactional Scenarios\n\nThere are many instances where individuals want to convey a signal to the market for their interest in specific products and/or services and want to do so in a zero-knowledge or minimal-knowledge environment. And the individual may also want to specific through what channels they wish to receive information/offers and how many offers they wish to receive within a specific time frame. Lastly, they can decide to do so in a true zero-knowledge environment or one where some a minimal amount of information is provided in order to help companies provide more targeted and relevant offers.\n\nLet's take two examples (one for each).\n\nAn individual decides to take up a new hobby (let's say, archery). That new hobby will involve procuring the proper equipment and clothing, training and instructions, and general resources to help the individual begin their journey to integrating this new hobby into their lives. They may wish to discover companies that cater to that hobby but do not want to be overwhelmed with offers or ads based on their observed behavior on search engines and social media. Instead, they would convey an Interest Signal which would include the required metadata that conveys\n\n- what channel they want to receive information in\n\n- What kinds of content/services they wish to receive (products and/or service)\n\n- How many offers/ads they wish to receive per type within a defined period (per week, per month).\n\nIn this scenario, it may be irrelevant the gender or geographic location of the individual, so this scenario could run as a Zero-Knowledge one, with no personally identifiable information passing through, only the Interest Signal and the stated preferences.\n\nA second scenario would fall under the Minimal Knowledge area where the recipient has information that is pertinent to responding but nothing that is directly identifiable to an individual. An individual decides they want to purchase a new automobile. Beyond that Buying Signal, it would be useful for companies to know more about the person in order to make the best offer. These might include general location (for instance, Canada), and some lifestyle details which will need to be accommodated by any purchase (for instance, 2 kids, 3 large dogs, hobbies including skiing/snowboarding). The individual can then dictate the preferences for offers that would be captured with defined metadata\n\n- what channel they want to receive offers in\n\n- When they want the offers and when do they expect to make the purchase.\n\n- How many offers/ads they wish to receive and for how long of a time period.\n\nThese would be considered qualified leads by automobile companies since there is clear interest and intent, while also allowing the individuals to product scarcity (in defining the number of offers) and controlling the cadence of offers before they make a decision.\n\nIn general, these use cases are defined as Transactional; short term needs with defined timelines and outcomes. Let's turn our attention to more longer-term, relationship-centric scenarios\n\n2.   Relationship Archetypes\n\nIn the Profila mode relationships are either defined as one-way or bi-directional. One way relationships (where an individual expresses interest in a brand's product or services but there is no data subscription offered or accepted) are called Connections.\n\nConnections\n\nAn individual can connect with a brand that they know they like or occasional make purchases from. It's not vital that the brand have a defined known data relationship with the individual (so no names or other intimate details required). In this kind of relationship, the individual may just want to know the new products offered by the company once or twice a year, or want to receive offers or discounts for their next purchase. It is a casual relationship but one that is still profitable to the company since it produces revenue with minimal marketing effort.\n\nIn this scenario, an individual can connect with a brand and then define the terms of the interaction.\n\n- what channels they want to receive offers/content\n\n- The types of content they wish to receive (product updates, company social campaigns, offers and discounts)\n\n- How often they will allow these contacts (once or twice a year, for example).\n\nThese preferences will be stored with metadata contracts along with the defined preferences about which personal data is provided (perhaps the person's gender, age, and city/country). Combined, the individual as asserted control over what the company knows about them as individuals and how often they should expect to be contacted and through which channel. And for the brand, they now have an existing customer who can be marketed too with less effort, higher engagement (since it's according to their preferences) and better conversation and return on their minimal marketing investment.\n\nSubscribers\n\nThe other relationship scenario present in the Profila model is one of Subscription. In this scenario, a brand sends a subscription offer to an individual with the request for specific types of personal information; demographic and psychographic based on self-discovery quizzes organized into categories). This offer is for defined renumeration and for a defined duration of time. The individual can accept or reject the offer after reviewing the conditions and requests. This agreement will be captured in a transaction metadata contract as per the previous Profila proposal for Catalyst.\n\nThe second aspect of this relationship is a separate contract capturing the metadata as defined by the individual for the expected behavior within the relationship. These stated preferences would take a similar form as what we've seen in earlier scenarios above\n\n- what channel would they like their communication in\n\n- What kind of communication types are allowed\n\n- How often they will allow communication per type\n\n- Any special timely preferences, such as wanting to restrict content for a certain amount of time (for holiday or because a product line is not relevant to the individual for the coming time period).\n\nAs an example, imagine an individual has accepted a subscription offer from a shoe company that specializes in outdoor footwear. The individual is a brand loyalist and has a range of this brand's offerings (from sandals to shoes to hiking boots). The individual expects to be a long term customer of this brand but right now their current collection of shoes are relatively new and they are not in the market for a purchase for the coming 9-12 months. While this individual currently has their preferences stated as accepting monthly offers and updates through their preferred channel, they want to change these preferences so that they receive no offers for the next 12 months but would appreciate any updates on socially conscious projects the company is involved with. These new preferences would be captured, overwriting the previous preferences, and the brand would know that, to keep this customer happy, they can scale back their marketing efforts until this brand loyalist is ready to purchase a new product in a year's time.\n\n3.   Governance / Enforcement\n\nAll of these examples open up a new range of empowerment for individuals to create and manage their communication preferences to a degree not possible with any current solution or platform. But without a defined governance and enforcement this power would be moot. Thankfully, we have very simple but powerful ways to completely enforce the preferences stored as metadata in contracts.\n\nIf the chosen channel for communications is the Profila platform (where individuals would receive communication in the form of posts or messages) we will be able to use the preference metadata to enforce those preferences. For instance, if I have informed a brand that I wish to only receive one offer a month, the amount of communication possibilities available to a brand will be \"0\"they sent me something last week. It will only become \"1\" again in three weeks time. Since communication through the platform is based on available engagements, that brand will have no mechanism to send additional communications beyond my stated preference. Within our platform these preferences are completely enforceable.\n\nIf the chosen channel for communication is email, we also have a solution, similar to one's employed by Apple and others. Each Profila user will have an @profila.com address which can be registered by the user as their default email (what is exposed to brands) but has a corresponding personal address (such as an @gmail.com or @outlook.com address) that communication is routed through. Because Profila can play the role of protector and middle-man, we can again enforce the preferences stated by the user. Profila can play the gatekeeper role that each individual decides they want us to play. Or not. It is always up to each individual.\n\n4.   Practical aspects – \"show us the money\" – costs\n\nVia this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our metronome POC, which will require at least a budget of 36.650 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 15 days of senior blockchain developer @ 900 USD per day – totaling 13.500 USD\n\n- 20 days of web/backend developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.000 USD\n\n- 20 days of app developer @ 300 USD per hour – totaling +/- 6.000 USD\n\n- 7 days of legal and operational work, including reporting @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.650 USD\n\n 5.   Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer\n\nAt the time of the submission of our application, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.\n\n(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila. These campaigns will show the benefits of Profila (=individual in control; individual compensated) and will attract the first customers to join this kind of new loyalty program. It is therefore not necessary that all the brands' customers join, but mostly the loyal customers that want to be engaged. We project that for SME companies, around 5% of their existing customer base will join this \"new relationship\" in the first year/after the promotional campaign. This would be seen as a success.\n\nWe have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021. According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 in 2022 (by adding more brands).\n\n(2) Geographical focus market? We are currently launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q1 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).\n\n(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy \"Millennials\" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old), and \"brand-loyalists\" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).\n\nFollowing a research collaboration we conducted with the University of St. Gallen University of Zurich (Switzerland) to define our go-to-market strategy, we concluded that Millennials are the target consumer audience. Millennials carry out most of their transactions online and are aware of their digital footprint. They are also aware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it. \n\n(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers.\n\n(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end-of-April 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above). \n\nIntellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)\n\nAs an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:\n\nFirst, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.\n\nSecond, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.\n\nIn addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.\n\nFinally, we are looking into open-sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.\n\nWhat does success look like?\n\nImagine an individual who has a wealth of brand relationships; from those where they are a loyalist and those brands they interact/purchase from on occasion. In addition, they enjoy discovering new brands and products. In all of these cases, this individual has created a simple structure where they control how often and even when during the week the ads, content, and offers come to them. The rest of the week they can enjoy life without the constant bombardment of email newsletters & unwanted and irrelevant ads in their chosen channel. And when they decide to go on holiday that can put a temporary stop on the entire flow. In short, they are in control, with their privacy and data protected. And brands can now spend their time on quality instead of quantity.\n\nWe will shortly add additional information on the 3 - 6 and 12 month milestones to measures succes of the project's development and implementation.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370223-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n- Ａ beautiful and clean interface and design\n\n- Showcase your favorite NFTs\n\n- Great for newcomers and power users\n\n- It can be used even by people who are not familiar with crypto\n\n- Replace texts with clear icons\n\n- One-click ADA staking","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370225-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis proposal sets out to meet the challenge brief by providing an enhanced step by step structure to create strong ideas and understanding for themselves and the community\n\nContent to be developed\n\nTemplates\n\nTemplates will be additional content intended as attachments to submissions that help clearly communicate in familiar common formats for understanding the problem, benefits, problem and roadmap of a proposal.\n\nExamples\n\nexamples of successful past submissions categorized for easy reference\nexamples of template content filled\n\nWiki\n\nA step by step guide for ideation, team building, using the templates and developing strong business cases, benefits statements, requirements and proposals.\n\n \n\nDefinition of Success and key metrics\n\nAfter 3 months, content should be available, clear and community agrees content meets the brief\n\nAfter 6 months, content should be used in support of 20% of proposals submissions (attachments)\n\nAfter 12 months, proposals using content should achieve a higher average score","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370226-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nParts of this have been submitted directly to IOHK and Atala PRISM is what brought me to Cardano and then Catalyst. \nFocus on the 1099 tax forms and current onboarding requirements for contractors across all industries, globally. \n\n \n\nAction Plan\n\nRoadmap - Have background and onboarding services lined up with AML/KYC by 12/15/2021.\nWill be marketing with a focus on the end of the year tax forms, the 1099.

The private key is encrypted and locked inside the hardware forever, but the device can still use the key to generate its own signatures.\n\nAlong with the private key, a certificate chain of trust is used to prove that each key is authentic and signed by the same trusted root certificate.  The device and signer certificates are locked inside the device and the root certificate will be permanently added to the Cardano blockchain via transaction metadata. \n\nThe hardware architecture is also designed to allow for secure control over the device which means it is feasible for the system to check if someone owns an NFT before allowing certain functionality.\n\nCardano is a good fit for this concept because of the low cost requirement for adding metadata to the blockchain.  The security is also very high in that the risk the information needed to prove authenticity disappears is only as big as the risk of the Cardano blockchain shutting down.\n\nFor a complete technical deep dive, please review this post on Substack: https://nftnixie.substack.com/p/nft-nixie-technical-deep-dive-part\n\nReal World Parallels\n\nA simple parallel to the \"old world\" would be a car title and the associated physical car. The car title establishes legal ownership of the car. Within the title, there is a VIN number, which links the paper certificate to the physical item because the same VIN number is also embedded into the vehicle. The state holds a centralized database of registered cars and their VIN numbers along with the details of the legal owner. If your personal information is listed on the car title, you can match the VIN number on the paper to the VIN number on the car to prove its yours.\n\nIn this project, the NFT would act as the car title. However, the NFT is also capable of acting as a car key. There can also be multiple car keys, each giving the driver a different max allowable speed to drive (for example). The state's centralized database is replaced with the metadata permanently written to the Cardano blockchain.  And finally, having access to the wallet holding the NFT replaces all of the personal information of the owner listed on the title.\n\nInspiration\n\nBeeple sold an NFT representing one of his digital artworks.  He also mailed a copy of the physical artwork along with a paper certificate and hair sample to the buyer.  He claims the hair sample was from a Beeple stuffed animal, but there are rumors that he used his own hair...  There must be a better way to prove authenticity!  \n\n \n\nUniswap's Unisocks project produced 500 pairs of physical socks brandished with pink unicorns and the Uniswap logo. 1 fungible SOCKS token could be redeemed for a SOCKS NFT and an associated pair of physical socks.  To my knowledge, there is no way to prove the physical socks are not counterfeit.\n\n \n\nThe New Balance and IOHK Realchain & OMN1S concept allowed anyone to physically scan a NFC tag embedded in a pair of shoes to prove authenticity.  To my knowledge, the shoes had no digital representation, the tags were only used as a method for tracking ownership and proving authenticity.\n\n \n\n Philosophy Questions\n\nWhich asset holds value?  The NFT or the physical? \nIf an asset has both a physical and digital representation, does that give it more value? \nIf the physical asset is destroyed or damaged how does that affect the value of the NFT? \nIf I lose access to the NFT, I might no longer be able to use the physical asset (depending on implementation). How does that affect the value of the physical asset?\n\nStatus\n\nAfter 2 hardware builds and 4-5 months of hardware and software development, 20 fully functional proof-of-concept prototypes are already built and in hand. Firmware with core functionality has been written and a simple front end webpage has been designed. The webpage has a working authentication mechanism which has been verified to work with the hardware.\n\nEssentially the core physical product is ready to go.\n\nRoadmap\n\n- 1-3 months (or less): Project and product release - hardware ready ship with simple clock functionality and authentication capability.  Hire a front-end dev or Plutus pioneer to help finish the \"exchange-for physical+NFT\" portion of the project.\n\n- 3-6months: Advanced firmware completed and shipped with access control capability, cryptocurrency price ticker, and Cardano epoch slot clock functionality.  Ship instructions for connecting and using a Raspberry PI (instead of the onboard microcontroller) with the NFT Nixie as a Raspberry Pi header.\n\n- 6-12 months: Ideate, design, and release another cool concept with similar proof of authenticity and potentially new features.  Due to the current worldwide chip shortage, these dates might slip further depending on the lead time for required components.\n\n- 12-36 months: : Ideate, design, and release a higher quantity, less niche, product\n\nThe funds requested here will be used to support further development and future new project deliveries for the Cardano ecosystem.  In the short term, I will most likely need to hire some kind of front-end dev or Plutus Pioneer to finish the \"exchange for physical+NFT\" portion of the project. \n\nApprox. cost for completed proof-of-concept hardware builds (20 units): $12,000.  Cost varies greatly depending on quantity and complexity of hardware, but am happy to be completely transparent on every individual cost item required for future project builds.  Hardware builds can be expensive. If there is a mistake in the design, it costs a lot of money to run another build...unlike software engineering where a code recompile is usually free.\n\n \n\nMy time: My time is not typically free, but so far this project has been a labor of love for months.  I currently have a full time job at a top Silicon Valley company which can be very demanding of my time - this hobby project must always come second to that since it is what supports me financially.\n\nConnect w/ me\n\nI would like to try to connect with anyone who is interested in bringing this concept to life as well as help further refine this idea into even more products in the future. This could include DEXes, NFT marketplaces, smart contract developers, firmware developers, hardware developers, cryptography experts, or business/marketing folks. \n\nI am happy to gift one NFT Nixie and associated NFT to a partner which needs the hardware to help with firmware or front-end development.\n\nI would also like to think about releasing the product of this proof-of-concept in a style similar to the UNISOCKS project, which might make it a great showpiece for a new Cardano DEX.  Fungible NIXIE tokens will be burnt in return for the NFT and physical NFT Nixie.\n\nThe NFT Nixie will be released no matter what happens with Catalyst.\n\n More NFT Nixie Literature & Contact Information\n\nConcept Introduction: https://nftnixie.substack.com/p/nft-nixie-technical-deep-dive-part\n\nTechnical Deep Dive: https://nftnixie.substack.com/p/intro\n\nWebsite: https://nftnixie.com\n\nTwitter: @NFTNixie\n\nEmail: nftnixie@protonmail.com\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/xRhuPUz6\n\nReferences\n\nTotal worldwide trade volume: https://www.statista.com/statistics/264682/worldwide-export-volume-in-the-trade-since-1950/\n\nCounterfeit Goods Percentage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_consumer_goods\n\nUnisocks: https://unisocks.exchange/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370234-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370190-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRevisiting the Problem Statement\n\nVoting is possible when deciding which proposals should be funded through Project Catalyst, but there are no systems in place for the projects themselves that allow for voting on and recording operational decisions in a transparent and immutable way.\n\nSubjective interpretation of past events can cause conflict and dissolution, which in turn can lead to organizational fragmentation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroducing the Solution (How we address the challenge question).\n\nA off2on chain voting mechanism will resolve conflict for self governing communities building on Cardano by creating an immutable record of agreed upon decisions.\n\nBy providing a frame of reference that moves subjective arguments to objective consensus we can encourage more meaningful participation in Project Catalyst from community members going forward.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDetailed Solution\n\n1) Voting Power\n\nSecretDecks aim to introduce a tightly coupled on-chain voting system by minting voting tokens and distributing them based upon a SourceCred cross-reference.\n\nSourceCred is a tool for communities to measure and reward value creation (https://sourcecred.io/).\n\n2) Structure\n\nThe structure of the process will be a binary Yes/No decision option.\n\n3) Mapping\n\nThese Yes/No decisions will be mapped to the SourceCred data\n\n4) Presentation\n\nVote information presented on one page where vote can be made by clicking either \"Yes\" or \"No\" to initiate voting transaction.\n\n5) Voting\n\nSecretDecks members with voting power signal their decision with their wallet.\n\n6) Results\n\nVoting is tallied and results recorded & displayed.\n\n7) Publication\n\nResults are minted as an NFT.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n🦾 KPIs - Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months\n\nGeneral\n\nSecretDecks quorum of at least 50%\n\nAfter 3 months\n\n1+ adoptions of Simple SD Off2OnChain mechanism\n\nCompletion of SD governance epoch without fragmentation of the organization\n\nAfter 6 months\n\n3+ adoptions of Good SD Off2OnChain\n\nCompletion of SD governance epoch without fragmentation of the organization\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n₳ Budget\n\nUX design, wireframes - $ 700\n\nCode (Frontend Javascript or Vue) - $ 950\n\nMessage signer integration $ 500\n\nTesting (Wallets) - $ 290\n\nSetup voting results simple web interface / vote NFT viewer: Approx. - $ 300\n\nDocumentation 20 hours per month at $ 40 hour for 3 months = $ 2400\n\nTOTAL: 5190 $\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n📊 Milestone plan\n\nMS0 | in progress | ⅔ done | done by: November 2021\n\nBasic tracking of contributions across different channels and spectrums (intangible & tangible) for more than two months;

Newcomers will be derivated to Catalyst and crowdfunding hubs to start thinking on their next steps towards building on Cardano. \n\n \n\nAlso the idea is to focus on basic Cardano wallet usage tutorials but mostly on simple dApp integrations to seed future builders and posible Catalyst proposers from other countries into Cardano. Nowdays there is a wallet that is commited to facilitate dApp integrations through simple URL connectors that can be used not only on websites and apps, but also on email, social and messaging platforms, and this can be built by no-developers because they are almost no-code based, users can generate them using a very simple JSON script called GameChanger Script. Here is a simple \"minter tweet\" to try this out:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GameChangerOk/status/1433861451618426880?s=20\n\nGameChanger Wallet is a highly humanized and gamified wallet commited 100% to lower the entry barrier for students, entrepreneurs, junior developers and people in general around the world.It's primary goal is to allow people focus on what really matters rather than loose attention on device requirements, non intuitive user interfaces, and high level coding skills requirements.\n\n \n\nGameChanger Wallet is going to be improved over time to allow internationalization but in the while as many pioneers around the world do their first steps on english written products first, we propose to start that way as well to make a first iteration of this onboarding project. \n\n \n\nFunds to popularizers are going to be delivered upon results like posts on platforms, tutorials delivered, meeting attended, etc..\n\n \n\nFunds for Internationalization first steps, smart contract support and infrastructure scaling is being asked on this other proposal:\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/GameChanger-The-onboarding-wallet/367709-48088\n\nBudget breakdown:\n\nMost of the funds are for popularizers to cover content in 15  number of different languages (it can vary), delivered after requirements are fullfilled $1000 x 15  $15000\nSupport and community hubs expenses $3200\nContingency for scaling wallet infrastructure if the other proposal does not prosper. (Dandelion APIs colaboration) $300 x 6 months $1800 . In case of not needing this, we can grow the number of popularizers with it.\n\nAuditability:\n\nSocial and e-learning platform metrics\nWallet geographical and usage metrics\nsuccess stories from users and popularizers\nCommunity hubs feedback and attendants metrics\n\n \n\nHow success looks like since funding event?\n\nDay zero BC (Before Catalyst): Wallet is online already, and it is being improved everyday. The recruitment for popularizers will begin. In-deep coordination talks with Cardano community hubs will start. \nAfter 3 months: Popularizers will be recruited. Talks, documentation, code examples and tutorial will be shared. They  will be already making and publishing their content. Payments will be delivered upon publishing objectives. \nAfter 6 months AC (After Catalyst): Content will be already online, bringing new students, developers and even entrepreneurs from different countries and languages to Cardano. Community hubs will recieve them and point them to Catalyst to power their projects and for growing voting participation. \nAfter 12 months: Popularizers will be earning income and became incentivized to keep doing it. More builders from different languages will join. The wheel will be rolling by itself.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370237-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n-\n\nThe Proposal - International Legal Directory & Education Platform\n\nI am proposing to create an international opensource online platform and educational framework for the legal industry to access the information they need to know and to provide legalised and verified education in all of the international jurisdictions. This platform would offer a publicly available directory of legal professionals around the world who understand and can advise on the digital industry.\n\nThe transactions would be focused on the Cardano Blockchain using ADA NFTs, the project will be sustained by launching a Cardano Native Token called \"CHG\":\n\nhttps://cardanoassets.com/9823f946d1ac791a9ffc4d04811d4fe39df1931560402d1b4b2a4527\n\nThis will be built by Carl Henry Global: https://carlhenryglobal.com\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\nWorking Title: Digital Legal Network\n\nWe welcome new team members, collaborators, developers etc. who are interested in participating in bringing this project to fruition and expanding it to new directions. Please contact us through IdeaScale or on: solutions@carlhenryglobal.com\n\n \n\nLegal opinions, papers, education\n\nIn my opinion the only way that NFTs will become mainstream and accepted by the man in the street is when international legal professionals fully understand how a Cardano blockchain works and how assets held in NFTs have the possibility of establishing the history and ownership of any type of asset, digital or physical.\n\nCurrently the use of NFTs is open to all and is a permission-less facility, and up to now has been the domain mainly of digital assets, digital ownership has been borne out of tokens earned in computer games, these were used to buy various digital belongings, tools & weapons.\n\nThe legal profession now needs to look at the immutable possibilities for establishing ownership and transferring ownership of tangible assets in the real-world.\n\nPerhaps the best way of transmitting information to the legal profession will be to have legal professionals involved in creating & curating legal opinions, white papers, educational content online and reporting on real transactions that have been completed.\n\nBelow I have outlined an overview of the key aspects of NFTs and the blockchain the legal industry needs to understand, there will no doubt be additional refinements to this but as I have said my role within this project is to create an initial framework and online platform.\n\nThe objective would be that each countries legal professionals would import information from their particular jurisdiction in an open-sourced manner and the information would be built up as a decentralised legal digital guidance.\n\nThe international nature of ownership via non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of NFTs is that the system is standardised on an international basis meaning that once a countries legal profession understand the applications, particularly in their own jurisdiction, the legal registration of assets would be on an international blockchain that can be accessed all around the world.\n\nOnce any type of assets is established in an NFT and registered on the Cardano blockchain owners are then able to transfer ownership in return for a suitable value virtually instantaneously anywhere in the world.\n\nIf the asset is being purchased by a digital currency or token a smart contract can be created to establish a trust less transfer of the asset and payment.\n\nThe benefits of immutable nature of ownership of NFTs on the Cardano Blockchain.\n\nA key aspect of an NFT held on a blockchain is that once the history of the asset has been established on the blockchain and within the NFT, it cannot be changed. This is not the case with traditional paper-based systems where documents can be edited, forged or replaced.\n\nOf course, paper based systems will not disappear overnight and can run in parallel with the digital system until everyone becomes more comfortable with it.\n\nA Framework for Education & Awareness\n\nHere is a brief introduction to some of the key areas that need to be clarified legally and guidance generated for the legal professions use.\n\nEstablished ownership & borderless transfer of ownership of real property.\n\nThe foundation of this proposal will be to have the worlds legal professions accept the premise that ownership and transfer of assets can be legally and safely completed using the Cardano blockchain and NFTs.\n\nOnce this is achieved, we simply need to translate that understanding into specific use cases which again I have briefly outlined below.\n\nLand and real estate ownership.\n\nIt is possible that land and buildings can be registered in NFTs as separate items, particularly in the case of site modular construction.\n\nThere is also the possibility of creating land registry's where none exist currently, or the current system is very inefficient.\n\nAs with other assets, outlined below, one of the benefits of NFTs that must be highlighted is that the NFT can change hands and the underlying asset does not necessarily need any adjustments or re-registration.\n\nAnother benefit worth repeating is that the transactions could happen very quickly using an NFT on a blockchain, also these can be borderless transactions. there will be legal issues such as taxation liabilities, but these would be beyond my capabilities in this proposal.\n\nOwnership in the supply chain.\n\nMost supply chains use various digital techniques, such as bar codes and QR codes, to track items being delivered. Adding NFTs and blockchain technologies would allow very smooth and efficient tracking internationally while cutting down on potential fraud and theft.\n\nIt would also be possible to track the complete history of manufactured goods from the source of raw materials right the way through to the eventual owner.\n\nMaritime ownership.\n\nThere is clearly an opportunity to create a digital maritime register of ships, yachts and boats.\n\nVehicle ownership.\n\nIf vehicles are put onto the blockchain one of the biggest benefits is that the record would be truly international, this would be of great assistance in the case of the luxury car trade where vehicles are often sold across borders.\n\nPhysical Art Ownership.\n\nThis is one area where NFTs are actually gaining traction, I think because digital art is already an accepted asset class for the sale of NFTs, it has spilled over into the physical art world.\n\nJewellery, clothing, accessories\n\nQuite often when buying luxury on expensive items there is no \"proof of ownership\" incorporated into the item, this is one area where for the first-time portable luxury items can have the facility added where the ownership is provable.\n\nThe asset can be identified in various ways including photographic, the initial purchase receipt with ownership would be put into an NFT, if the asset is sold in an aftermarket, then the NFT can be then updated.\n\nIntellectual property, copyright & patent ownership.\n\nAgain, this is a case of setting up a parallel system that would be digital in nature and impossible to change the history while making the ownership information available publicly.\n\nFractional ownership within NFTs\n\nThere are a number of situations or scenarios where a physical asset needs to be owned by several parties, it would for instance be able to bequeath an asset in a will to be held in the ownership of several people.\n\nAnother situation would be investing in real estate by a group of people who could not individually afford to be part of the transaction.\n\nAn example of fractional fund raising could be a museum allowing partial ownership of its assets in order to raise funds to buy new exhibits, of course this would be a case off partial ownership without actual possession of the asset.\n\nNFTs as an investment without possession.\n\nTo expand on this particular situation, there may be benefits generated by the separation of ownership and possession of the asset for structuring purposes.\n\nThese scenarios, and more, would no doubt be explored and expanded upon by the legal professionals who would no doubt innovate overtime expanding the uses of NFTs and the blockchain technology.\n\nThe missing link\n\nThe missing link between the physical assets and its digital life in a database or on a blockchain is one of the startling points of interest. Solving this is part of this proposal.\n\nThe answer is to create smart digital tags, a small tamper-proof electronic tag can be attached to an asset. Different types of tags will be developed to suit different types of assets, these tags can be build into the asset its self during manufacturing.\n\nThe tag can be a simple chip recording the details of the NFT, or, be made \"smart\" with the addition of transmitting capabilities for example. Assets can be connected with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that would be able to connect to a blockchain via the internet.\n\nWhen the tag is attached to the asset and the piece has been registered to the Cardano blockchain, the physical-NFT link is in effect.\n\nThe tag's history cannot be changed but can be updated in the case of a transfer of ownership, or recycling for example.\n\nAs mentioned, the tag would be made tamper-proof, destroying the tag if removed. Another incentive not to remove the tag is that the value held in the NFT history would be lost and the value reduced.\n\nThank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCarl Henry\n\nTo be Powered By: https://carlhenryglobal.com\n\nCarl Henry Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\n \n\nRoadmap Overview\n\nThis project has been recently started, Catalyst Funding would help accelerate the development and roll-out of the project.\n\n3 Month Roadmap\n\nBuild a multilingual opensource online platform to register Legal Professionals internationally.\nCreate a diverse number of legal professionals as advisors & team members.\nStart curating legal opinions, examples of NFT use and legal benefits.\nCreate incentives to motivate the legal profession to adopt NFT use.\nAdd initial educational content about NFTs and other digital tools.\nIdentify specific problems & use cases to highlight.\nIdentify & work with legal professionals to create real world opportunities & solutions.\nIdentify countries where NFT ownership would be most beneficial.\nBuild and maintain a list of assets owned in NFTs as best practice examples.\nBuild and maintain a list of media to send regular updates about developments.\nConnect with legal individuals & firms to pro-actively promote the use of NFTs.\nResearch & development of tracking tags.\n\n6 Month Roadmap\n\nWe would continue with all of the items in the 3 month Items.\nInclude additional Cardano Blockchain uses such as Digital IDs.\nWork to decentralise control of the project.\n\n12 Month Roadmap\n\nPerhaps extent the directory and advice to incorporate other professions of use to the crypto industry.\nHave the project and key advisors appearing in major media promoting the project & explaining NFTs & oour industry.\n\n \n\nSocial Media - Carl Henry Global\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CarlHenryGlobal\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/carl-henry-global/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/carlhenryglobal/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/carlhenryglobal/\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@carlhenryglobalsa/\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/CarlHenryGlobalsa/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/channels/871290918693658624/871290918693658627\n\nIdeaScale: https://carlhenryglobal.ideascale.com\n\n \n\n \n\nCardano IdeaScale - 27 Insights & 10 Projects Submitted\n\nCarl Henry Global is committed to working with the Cardano Ecosystem and working to improve it, if you would like to see our other submissions please visit our profile: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3097499-48088\n\n \n\nBudget Line Items\n\n$15,000.00 Building the Legal Directory & Education Platform\n\n$8,000.00 Administration, data entry & Research\n\n$8,000.00 Translations\n\n$2,000.00 Consultation fees for launch of CHG Token\n\n$10,000.00 Marketing & social media costs\n\n$12,000.00 Content writing, publishing & posting","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370191-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369822-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nHow to Encourage Mass Adoption of Atala-Prism for Health Records?

As a result, there has been an enormous backlog of cases in the legal systems in many African countries. In some places, the backlog is more than a decade long--making it practically impossible to settle disputes over transactions. Recently, a number of countries have addressed this problem by providing new guidelines for dispute resolution and arbitration. For example, Ethiopia recently adopted a new legal framework for the binding arbitration. \n\nThe hope is that blockchain based tools can help resolve the problem. It is commonly said that \"code is law\" when it comes to smart contracts. This is misleading. Most contracts, whether written in natural language or as self-executing code, can give rise to disputes that lead to costly lawsuits. This is true any place a dispute arises, whether that is in the U.S., the EU or in Africa.\n\nSolution: \n\nThe best route to avoid the time, expense and uncertainty associated with lawsuits in African countries such as Ethiopia and Zambia is to take advantage of new legal frameworks for binding arbitration. In order to make this possible, appropriate dispute resolution and arbitration clauses  need to be incorporated as integrated provisions in smart contracts for enterprise level and p2p transactions. We propose to (1) develop educational resources for the Cardano community in Africa about the arbitration process, (2) create a set of readily available legal templates for binding arbitration clauses that developers can incorporate into their dApps to support users making smart agreements, (3) develop a dApp/integration for processing smart arbitration clauses and (4) enlist the help of legal experts and developers in a broad range of countries in Africa.\n\nPlan:\n\nIn the first four months of this project, the leaders aim to leverage the efforts of the Kepler SCS team to build legal templates and a dApp for dispute resolution and binding arbitration in the US, EU and UK. See the related Catalyst proposal in the dApp Challenge. Building on this experience, we plan to develop similar templates with a dApp for processing disputes specifically tailored for legal frameworks in African countries. In doing so, the Kepler team aims to cultivate a network of partners on the ground in Ethiopia, Zambia and other countries where Cardano has a growing presence. The Kepler SCS is providing the services of a Catalyst incubator for this project with the expectation that, in time, the individuals on the ground in African countries will move through an accelerator program and then gain greater autonomy in plotting their own path. The team has reached out to iceaddis with the hope of collaborating to build a local project leadership teams.\n\nTeam and Experience:\n\nJeffrey Downard, professor of law, ethics and logic.

The remarkable diversity of projects gives rise to a problem. How can the need for a wide range legal expertise be met in a cost effective way?\n\nHere is a small sample of the legal questions the developer community faces. What kinds of templates are needed for a wide range of smart contracts for the sale of homes, cars, insurance and loans? What safeguards are needed to protect the privacy of personal information in DIDs? What do DeFi dApp developers need to do in order to meet legal requirements governing securities and loans? How to effectively advocate for reasonable blockchain policy?\n\nLegal expertise is expensive. How can we meet the growing needs of the developer community in a cost effective manner--especially for projects that are in the early stages of growth?\n\nThe aim of this project is to create a network of lawyers and law students able to supply a pool of legal expertise for the growing developer community. Some projects need a little legal input. Others need well formulated contract templates. Whiles others may need to add legal expertise to their teams.\n\nMany young lawyers are attracted to the practice of law because they believe legal advocacy has the power to help realize a fairer world. In this vein, many lawyers who are largely unaware of the potential of the smart contracts will naturally be excited to learn about the vision being articulated by leaders in the blockchain ecosystem--such as Charles Hoskinson--for building economic and social tools that will create new opportunities and help level the playing field for all. We aim to draw these lawyers and law students into the Cardano Catalyst community and help connect them with developers running projects.\n\nOur team will create a set of online tutorials for lawyers and law students to introduce them to the legal questions that arise in the context of different types of developer projects. Educational resources are needed to bring a growing network of individuals having expertise in diverse areas of law up to speed about the rapidly developing smart contract ecosystem. The project aims to build a network supported by a broad range of social media resources to help lawyers connect with Cardano developers. In turn, collaborative legal research by the legal network will empower the community to advocate effectively for reasonable policy reforms.\n\nLead members of the team:\n\nJeff Downard, J.D., Ph.D., >25 years teaching jurisprudence, contracts, legal reasoning and theories of justice.\nSarah Holcomb, J.D., L.L.M., > 10 years teaching business and corporate law.

It is the result of its individuals and groups. Each new individual brings a new quality to the swarm. A healthy swarm is constantly evolving.\"\n\nThe active parts in SWARM are categorized in three groups that are related to engagement, trust and endurance. The Swarm doesn't give roles, roles are rather establishing themself over time in proved participation. Example: How to become a bricklayer? By laying bricks.\n\nHive: Those taking the highest personal initiative and responsibility in the total Swarm actions.\nSwarm Veterans: Highly dedicated supporters that have been constantly following the events over a period of time, taking action by hosting rooms and moderating sessions and discussions.\nSwarm Supporters: Engaged supporters who are repeatedly active in meetings and discussions.\n\n \n\nWHAT WE DO\n\nSwarm operates and interacts in and around the wider Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals, projects and communities to Project Catalyst. Our activities are characterized by the following qualities:\n\nListen to the community and gather data and opinions from an unbiased perspective.\nHost different events and meetups where the community members come together, share their ideas, connect, listen and get inspired from each other.\nReach out to underrepresented groups in the community, exploring ways to lower entry barriers and offer continuous support and advice.\nIntegrate local communities to enrich a diverse, multi-cultural Catalyst Community.\nModerate the community discussions in our events and Discord server in a way that empowers individuals to further engage.\nExplore novel ways for decentralized governance within our community, based upon practice oriented methods.\nDocument and track our activity to build trust and transparency.\nReproduce ourselves by creating new swarm groups to have a diverse co-existence and collaboration of several swarms.\n\n \n\nI M P A C T\n\nDetailed Problem Description:\n\nTown Hall is a weekly event organized by IOG and serves as one of the main entry points into the Project Catalyst. Town Halls are attended by hundreds of people every week and the recordings on YouTube average 2000-4000 views. Difference in YouTube views and live Town Hall participation is obvious. We see YouTube views as leads generated by Town Hall that we would like to convert to proposers. Currently, almost all of the Town Hall participants stay and actively participate in the After Town Hall events which shows community interest in this format.\n\nSignificant number of entrepreneurs and developers in other blockchain ecosystems are still underestimating or are not familiar with possibilities on Cardano. We believe that an interactive format like After Town Hall can be a great introduction to knowledgeable and constructive people within Cardano. We believe that these interactions can lead to significant inflow of outsiders into the ecosystem because we recognize the power of the Cardano community, as we have witnessed it on many occasions so far.\n\nDetailed Solution Description:\n\nWe are organizing and delivering:\n\nWeekly moderated Zoom Events with multiple, content dependent break-out rooms\nWell established community moderators who facilitate breakout rooms and guarantee high quality conversations\nDepending on the topic, breakout rooms visual support by the use of Miro-boards to help facilitate an engaged and lean discussion\nEngagement of participants during the week by establishing communication to Newcomers\nTracking the progress of ATH growth & success of breakout rooms\n\nWe would like to add new things:\n\nProfessionals to hold breakout rooms on relevant subjects where they will present and answer questions from participants\nInfluential figures from Cardano and crypto space to present and engage with the community\n\nImpact on Challenge and Cardano:\n\nWe want to include and onboard active participants of other blockchain ecosystems as well as provide a platform for people new to the cryptocurrency world. We want to demonstrate openness and power of our community because we see it as our most precious resource and a definite differentiator from other crypto projects. If we successfully onboard only a couple of entrepreneurs or developers, we expect the word to spread out quickly. By adding more proposers to Catalyst, we increase the quality of the proposals, we increase the ADA transaction volume and finally, the adoption of Cardano itself.\n\n \n\nF E A S I B L I T Y\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\nWe have hosted 13+ weekly ATHs so far.\n\nFurthermore, we moderate a Discord Server with more than 500 highly engaged members.\n\n \n\nOur ATHs are characterized by:\n\nHigh engagement and interaction\nFair and open discussions\nRelaxed and friendly atmosphere\nConstant growth in participants\nInitiating ideation and collaboration\nProposer-voter interactions\nRelevant content for Project Catalyst\nFlexible adjustments to just-in-time content\n\n \n\nCore Team & Roles:\n\nDominik - Hosting, finance and accounting, social media and marketing\nFelix - Hosting, outreach to new hosts and topics, organizing\nFilip - Hosting, organizing, finance, outreach to partners\nJakob - Moderation, hosting, organizing\nSimon - Hosting, website, GitHub, working on connected projects\nStephen - Github documentation and tracking for transparency and trust building\nTevo - Hosting, improving organizational structure, miro boards, website updates\nVictor - Hosting, organizing, creating content\n\nMore Details on www.catalystswarm.com\n\n \n\nBudgeting: \n\nFor facilitating 17 After Town Halls each Wednesday from November 2021 to February 2021\n\nEach event is calculated with $812 which covers following activities: \n\n- Reaching out to ideas and hosts, onboard hosts\n\n- Organize each event\n\n- Market and communicate the event \n\n- Document event activities for transparency\n\n- Moderate and host the event\n\n \n\nCalculation: 17 events for $812 each = $13.804 total\n\n \n\nA U D I T A B I L I T Y\n\n \n\nTransparency:\n\nOngoing activities are documented in the following Gitbook: \n\nhttps://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/\n\n \n\nMilestones and Key Deliverables:\n\nEstablishing an engaged and interactive \"After Town Hall\" (ATH) Event:\n\nA moderated Zoom Event with multiple, content dependent break-out rooms\nWell established community moderators will facilitate breakout rooms and guarantee high quality conversations\nDepending on the topic, breakout rooms will be visually supported by the use of Miro-boards to help facilitate an engaged and lean discussion\nFollowing & maintaining engagement of participants during the week by establishing communication to Newcomers\nTracking the progress of ATH growth & success of breakout rooms\n\nProviding customized solutions for international communities\n\nEnabling community members, to translate Catalyst events in different languages, depending on demand\nFurther advising emerging communities to create dynamic structures for engagement that are connected to ATH, supporting group building\nAdapting & evolving the ATH format according to demand\nSurveying the international community for additional time slots\nCreating feedback loops within the community to constantly adapt and evolve the formats and tools (e.g. Mentimeter, surveys)\nReacting to just in time content\n\nEstablishing better communication channels between key stakeholders within the system\n\nProviding stages for SPOs, projects, communities to present their concerns and interact\nConnecting emerging entities and formats to work more efficient and effective: Catalyst Circle, ATH Swarm Sessions\nFacilitating the development of \"Community Stories\"\n\nEstablishing a community narrative that connects the different ATH / TH & Swarm Sessions\n\nFurther guiding the conversations by providing breakout rooms for deep dives in Swarm Sessions on Saturday\nEmpower community members to host their own interest and topic related breakout rooms\nSupporting Newcomers on their way to become CAs, create proposals etc.\n\n \n\nMeasures of Success, Key Performance Indicators:\n\nDeliver weekly After Town Hall session\nminimum 5 breakout rooms with moderators\nHolding a retention rate of over 80% of Town Hall participants stay for After Town Hall\nIn partnership with Catalyst School deliver specific breakout rooms for proposers\nTrack entrepreneur participation and engagement in further Catalyst funds","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366709-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n \n\nHEY CATALYST COMMUNITY!\n\nIt is proven that short, energetic videos attract attention and interest. That's why we're applying for some resources to increase our capacity to get people excited about Project Catalyst.\n\nHave you seen our trailer for Fund 6 yet (see video above)? \n\nYou can also re-watch the Town Hall Meeting intro from August 18, where we played it, as well (starts at 1:30): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n_______ I M P A C T _______\n\nHow does this proposal fit into this challenge?\n\nDespite a very active Community around Cardano, Project Catalyst is still very unknown. Raising awareness about Catalyst through a marketing campaign will increase meaningful participation and attract new entrepreneurs from the community and from outside the Cardano ecosystem, which is the primary goal of this challenge 'Proposer Outreach'.\n\nHow will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?\n\nCurrently Catalyst has about 30k+ members on Ideascale. The goal is to grow to 100k members by the end of 2021 (see town hall video of April 21st). This campaign is going to reach +250k views and +15k clicks and interactions. Therefore, this campaign will have a huge impact in reaching the set goals and will help our community to grow not only in size but also in quality, because the campaign will also support entrepreneurs to create successful proposals (see more details below).\n\nOutlook and future challenges?\n\nThis proposal includes the possibility to apply for further funding in the future. Since the content (video and landing page) is already created then, the funds can be used more efficiently to leverage our contribution in order to reach the set goals (100k by end of 2021).\n\n \n\n \n\n______ F E A S I B L I T Y _______\n\nBUILDING A SUCCESSFUL ONLINE MARKETING CAMPAIGN\n\nA successful online marketing campaign consists of two key elements:\n\nincrease awareness through great content\na strong call-to-action plan\n\nGreat content is the foundation of any online campaign. But the reach and therefore the success of the campaign depends mainly on the way in which the content is implemented and whether the attention can be turned into call-to-action. Therefore, the creation of content, the generation of traffic and the call-to-action part must be linked together.\n\n \n\nCONTENT CREATION\n\n1)Trailer\n\n A short 30 second video clip (see Fund 6 trailer)\n\nLanding page\n\nAs Ideascale might be an overwhelming experience for newcomers, the trailer will link to a short landing page that will introduce the Catalyst process and also link to important resources like documents and other community sites. It also contains a strong call-to-action by encouraging entrepreneurs to propose their ideas on Catalyst and providing assistance to do so successfully. Furthermore, the landing page will give us the opportunity to measure and analyze the traffic which is important to run a campaign successfully.\n\n \n\nCAMPAIGN STRATEGY\n\nGreat content will eventually be found organically, but we should obviously do everything we can to make sure our video gets the attention it deserves. That's why a paid ad strategy is important to get the reach we want. For this purpose YouTube ads are a perfect channel to raise awareness about Project Catalyst. This channel reaches 90% of internet users worldwide and has a very active crypto community. The given options for setting a campaign on this channel enable us to effectively reach our target group, because the trailer will be shown next to blockchain-related content. A further advantage of YouTube is the low cost-per-click ratio. And thanks to real-time tracking, adjustments in the campaign can be made at any time.\n\nORGANIC REACH\n\nIn addition, we as a community can share (post/retweet) the created video on other social media channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, etc) to expand the impact of this campaign. I also encourage the community to contact me if there are other use-cases for the video.\n\nTEAM\n\nDominik: campaign management, story board\n\nExperience: 10+ years in marketing, 4+ years as entrepreneur and business consultant\n\nWebsite-link: see proposal description\n\nThomas: video creation\n\nExperience: Conception, design and composting for more than 100 trailer for Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, etc\n\nLinkedIn-profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszuchtriegel/\n\nBUDGET\n\nThe budget is divided in two parts: content creation and advertisement\n\n \n\nContent creation: $2.610\n\nVideo trailer (incl. ideation, storyboard, effects, editing, cutting, sound): 30 hours a $45 = $1.350\n\nLanding page (incl. content, design, hosting, SEO): 42 hours a $30 = $1.260\n\n \n\nBudget for Advertisement: $10.080\n\nYouTube Ads: $300 per day for 28 days = $8.400\n\nCampaign Management: 56 hours a $30 (2h per day for 28 days): $1.680\n\n \n\n \n\n____ A U D I T A B I L I T Y _____\n\n \n\nROADMAP\n\n1 month after funding:\n\nVoting results are expected to be announce at the beginning of November, followed by the launch of Fund 7 directly afterwards. As it takes some weeks until the rewards are distributed, we will launch an 'organic' Fund 7 campaign based on the already created trailer for Fund 6. Therefore, we will share the Fund 7 trailer on various social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.) in collaboration with IOG and Cardano Foundation.\n\n2-3 months after funding:\n\nIn regards for the Fund 8 campaign, which is expected to launch in February, we will place ads yon YouTube in addition to the 'organic' campaign to increase significantly the reach of the campaign. We will also create an update for the trailer to show something new to the world. \n\n \n\nTRANSPARENCY\n\nAfter each campaign, we will publish any figure that is related to the success of the campaign. This information will be available on public community sites (like projectcatalyst.org) and on my website (link in proposal description).\n\n \n\nMETRICS & KPIs\n\nThe goal of this campaign is to raise awareness about Project Catalyst among the Cardano Community and the blockchain industry. The following metrics and indicators will measure the success of this campaign. The targeted figures are based on experience and are to be regarded as realistic.\n\nMedia coverage:\n\nTotal views of ads: min. 250k\nTotal clicks: min. 15k\nLanding page visitors: min. 20k\nLanding page interactions: min. 250 (measured as subscription or using contact form)\n\nParticipation in Catalyst:\n\nIncrease the number of submitted proposals\nIncrease the quality of submitted proposals (average CA rating)\nTotal number of voters (registered wallets and registered ADA)\n\n \n\n_______ F A Q _______\n\nHow do we reach the right target group?\n\nReaching the right audience needs to be carefully built up. The best way to ensure this, is to track conversions which mean that we constantly monitor the impact of different keywords. With the landing page as second part of the campaign, we can easily track with different metrics if we attract the right people. Also we are currently asking Ideascale what data they can provide us because they can see the activities of new users who sign up through our campaign (e.g. how many new accounts are created, etc.).\n\nWhy only YouTube ads?\n\nYes, there are other ways for online marketing. In my experience, YouTube and Google Ads are a very good way to start building a campaign in most cases. Results are easy to manage and costs are much lower compared to other channels. I chose YouTube over Google Ads because video content reinforces the memory of the content being conveyed much more than text or photos. And since we have already created a trailer, this will increase the effectiveness of the funding.\n\nI will limit myself to one channel here because it takes time to build a campaign. Every campaign is different and you always have to check again the effect of the different keywords. If you don't make this properly you can easily waste money which of course we want to avoid. So if you divide the budget between different channels, the overall impact of the campaign will decrease because you have less budget to use the collected data and feedback for improvements.\n\nHow do ad blockers affect the campaign?\n\nMany people are not familiar with the mechanism of online marketing. The answer here is simple: ad blockers don't affect the reach of the campaign, because you only pay per view or per click (depending on the campaign settings). So for example: Your ad budget is $100 and the cost per click is $1. Then YouTube shows the video to as many users as it takes to reach the 100 clicks. So if someone blocks ads in general, it won't affect the reach. It just means that you don't reach everybody. Which is acceptable, because the target group is much larger than our budget for ad spendings. In addition, this video will be shared on different social media channels. So eventually we will reach those people organically.\n\n \n\n____ H A P P Y __ V O T I N G ____\n\nLet's grow together and thus positively influence the development and adoption of Cardano.\n\nThank you for your votes!\n\n.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366711-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nOUR MISSION\n\n\"The SWARM is a community-driven \"grass roots\" initiative, supporting Cardano in its mission to build a universal decentralized system that provides access to a global society and economy.\"\n\nCONNECT: We bring the community together to unleash its full potential.\n\nINCLUDE: We build bridges to ensure the diversity of the Cardano community.\n\nEMPOWER: We encourage everyone to act and lead by creating space to do so.\n\n \n\nWHO WE ARE\n\n\"The SWARM is a dynamic organism. It is the result of its individuals and groups. Each new individual brings a new quality to the swarm. A healthy swarm is constantly evolving.\"\n\nThe active parts in SWARM are categorized in three groups that are related to engagement, trust and endurance. The Swarm doesn't give roles, roles are rather establishing themself over time in proved participation. For example: How do you become a birdwatcher? Well… by watching birds ;)\n\nHive: The core team that is taking the highest personal initiative and responsibility in the total Swarm actions.\nSwarm Veterans: Highly dedicated supporters that have been constantly following the events over a period of time, taking action by hosting rooms and moderating sessions and discussions.\nSwarm Supporters: Engaged supporters who are repeatedly active in meetings and discussions.\n\n \n\nWHAT WE DO\n\nSwarm operates and interacts in and around the wider Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals, projects and communities to Project Catalyst. Our activities are characterized by the following qualities:\n\nListen to the community and gather data and opinions from an unbiased perspective.\nHost different events and meetups where the community members come together, share their ideas, connect, listen and get inspired from each other.\nReach out to underrepresented groups in the community, exploring ways to lower entry barriers and offer continuous support and advice.\nIntegrate local communities to enrich a diverse, multi-cultural Catalyst Community.\nModerate the community discussions in our events and Discord server in a way that empowers individuals to further engage.\nExplore novel ways for decentralized governance within our community, based upon research and practice oriented methods.\nDocument and track our activity to build trust and transparency.\nReproduce ourselves by creating new swarm groups to have a diverse co-existence and collaboration of several swarms.\n\n \n\nI M P A C T\n\n \n\nDetailed Problem Description:\n\nA community-driven project like the Catalyst Fund needs organized events to connect ideas and initiatives, discuss and solve problems together, and initiate collaboration. Without moderation and facilitation, these efforts often come to nothing or the discussions go in circles without reaching a conclusion or being implemented.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nTo address these issues, weekly swarm sessions evolved out of the community in April. Since then, we have held Swarm sessions every week on Zoom - with different breakout rooms at each event. The weekly topics are related to current issues and events in the community. For example, when it is time for the Community Advisor (CA) to assess proposals, the Swarm Sessions provide workshops for CAs, etc.\n\nImpact on the Challenge and Cardano:\n\nThe 'Catalyst Value Onboarding' challenge is seeking ideas to increase meaningful participation in Project Catalyst.

This document can be used as a foundational artifact for future research relating to Cardano proposals.\nAdditionally, a single (basic) technical integration with a specific microlender will demonstrate how Cardano can integrate and extend a microlending solution.  A likely option is building a test bridge to Kiva's Hyperledger Indy solution. \nThe ultimate objective is to work with a single microlender to establish a strategic and technical pathway to a broader partnership.\n\n-----------Impact---------------\nHow does this proposal' problem statement fit the challenge? (slide 2)\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to work directly with microlenders that have existing presences in Africa and identify new opportunities for Africans to benefit from DeFi innovations.\n\nHow will this proposal add value to the Cardano ecosystem? (slide 12-14)\n\nBy identifying strategic and technical integration points between Cardano and microldenders, the Cardano community can implement new capabilities that extend functionality in the microlending space.\nWhile individual one-off efforts to work with microlenders is certainly possible, organizing discussions under the Cardano Catalyst initiative provides more clarity to our potential partners and allows us to define clear goals and objectives.\n\nHow will the proposal scale to address future challenges? (slide 16)\n\nAfter initial technical approaches have been identified, new opportunities will exist to build integrated solutions between Cardano and microlenders. Specifically, this can include linking two ledgers via DID solutions.\n\n-----------Feasibility---------------\nTeam (slide 18)\n\nWest Africa Decentralized Alliance (WADA): Skilled team of Cardano practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across West Africa and the diaspora.\nJon Saginaw: 20+ years experience in Technology Consulting, working with some of the world's most well-known companies. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonsaginaw/\nCore team includes: Blockchain Developer (1), Technical Writer (1), Partnership Development Lead (1 Part Time)\n\nBudget (slide 17-18)\n\nSlide 17 shows key activities and outcomes, while slide 18 shows the resources and timelines required to deliver this project.\nThe budget will support activities and outcomes of the core team across 6-8 weeks. \n\nPlan (slides 17-18)\n\nIn an initial 6 week initiative, communications with microlenders will identify the most beneficial partnerships, and assess strategic and technical partnership models.\nAdditionally, a demo will be created to link an existing solution (likely Kiva's Hyperledger platform) to Cardano to demonstrate functionality and identify potential implementation challenges.  \nKey activities will include: providing a Cardano-centric assessment of the existing microlending ecosystem, identifying potential partnership opportunities, discussing Cardano with potential partners to gauge interest, defining potential implementation options, and creating an initial (basic) integration with a leading microlender.\n\nRisks\n\nA key risk is identifying a partnership model while IOG is defining its own microlending capabilities in parallel.  As this is a large space with many providers, there should be room to explore multiple strategic opportunities. \n\n-----------Auditability---------------\nWhat Success Looks Like (slide 19)\n\nPositive communications with 3 microlenders, with identification of a strategic and technical path forward with 1 microlender.\nWhile this could take many shapes, an ideal solution will be to demonstrate a technical integration solution with 1 microlender, showing how it can connect to the Cardano ecosystem (and why this solution provides value for both the microlender and the Cardano community). \nAdditionally, this initiative will likely serve as the initial introduction to Cardano for many microlenders. The Cardano community can use this opportunity to establish initial relationships and communications channels.\n\nMetrics & KPIs (slide 19)\n\nThis initiative will target conversations with 3 potential microlenders partners to provide a general introduction to Cardano, review their blockchain objectives, and determine high-level potential for a broader partnership on future solutions.\nThe goal is to define and implement 1 basic technical integration with a leading microlender\n\n--Related Proposals--\nCardano Interop NOW: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Interop-NOW/369451-48088\n\nThe intention of this proposal is to build 1) a DID/VC Issuer & Verifier platform, and 2) an open-source digital wallet that, together, allows for cross-ledger DID interoperability. Specifically: interoperability across the dominant Hyperledger Indy ledger and the Cardano ledger.\nAs there will be many DID solutions (like there are many blockchains), interop across these solutions will be critical.\nWhile the Cardano Interop Now proposal builds the necessary connection points between Hyperledger Indy and Cardano ledgers, the Microlender Partnership Models proposal looks specifically at the technical feasibility of implementing Kiva's Hyperledger Indy/Aries solution with Cardano.\nWhere appropriate, there is expected to be collaboration across these two proposals given the strategic alignment of objectives, and alignment of technology solutions.\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366720-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nBingoChain with its accompanying BingoToken will aim to disrupt the Bingo gaming sector by providing a way to play for real value (even real money) without the gamer risking any of their own money. By incentivizing both the caller (organizer) and players with BingoTokens we aim to get callers to put real money into their games.\n\n- Callers and Winners will get one BingoToken for each player in their game.\n\n- Normal players who don't win will get a single BingoToken for each card they play in the game.\n\n- Players can acquire more cards to play by inviting friends to join.\n\n- Players can start games with more cards to play by keeping more BingoTokens in their linked wallet.\n\nSo, as BingoToken is distributed more widely and as its adoption and value grows, callers will be incentivized to put more value (ADA or USD) on the line to attract more players and in turn get more BingoTokens as a result.\n\nPlayers will have the thrill of competing for real value and our system is built to encourage community engagement by allowing callers to choose any type of meeting to call the game: Zoom, Google Meet, Twitch, Facebook, Teams etc.\n\nWe already have the development to a stage where we can run games and distribute BingoTokens and we would love feedback from the community. Funding will be used for ADA or USD prizes on some games which should kick start the ecosystem by attracting players and callers.\n\nWe'll host demo games every week on https://bingochain.io so anyone who is interested can join us for a game!\n\n \n\nFurther Info:\n\nThe idea began when a Casino Manager was locked out of his casino along with all his patrons when covid hit. Looking for a way to keep going he started distributing physical Bingo Cards and calling games over an online meeting. It soon became too popular to manage and we helped him by developing an online game geared towards real meetings. We soon realized we can enhance the experience by incorporating crypto into the game. We could remove the players risk without removing the reward – thus we started developing BingoChain.\n\nWe initially minted BingoToken on the Binance Chain and developed the game to a point where we could start playing real games to get feedback from the community. We struggled to attract interest whilst on the Binance network. Whilst we were developing the game, we gained interest in the Cardano blockchain and decided to get involved with the project and since then we have gained experience as a Cardano Stake Pool operator (AXNSA Pool) and have also seen the astonishing growth (and willingness to help) of the Cardano community, so we decided to make the shift and minted our token on the Cardano network.\n\n \n\nUser Experience\n\n1. Log in to BingoChain.io\n\n2. Fill in your profile details and enter your ADA wallet address.\n\n3. Play a Bingo Game (there will be a live stream or online meeting to join – just click the link it the Game screen)\n\n4. On completion of the Game:\n\n• All Players - Receive one BingoToken for every card you played if you didn't win.\n\n• Winner - Receive a number of BingoTokens equal to the total amount of players.\n\n• Caller - Receive a number of BingoTokens equal to the total amount of players.\n\n5. Tokens will be paid directly to your Cardano wallet at the end of the game. (Not yet implemented)\n\n \n\nExample Token Distribution\n\n• If you played 3 cards, you will get 3 Bingo Tokens if you didn't win,\n\n• If 25 players played in a game that you won, you will receive 25 Bingo Tokens\n\n• If 50 players played in a game that you called, you will receive 50 Bingo Tokens\n\nIf there were any ADA offered as a prize the ADA would also be distributed to the winner.\n\nIf there were any other prizes like USD, USDT or BTC in the game, the caller will need to distribute these after the completion of the game.\n\n* Note that we will be running regular demo games from the Registration phase so that users can interact with the system – Join us on BingoChain.io to be among the first to receive BingoTokens. Note that the automatic distribution script has not been completed, so we will manually distribute BingoTokens for users who have accumulated more than 100 tokens.\n\n \n\nQ&A: What do I do with the BingoTokens?\n\nWe plan to build in various utility for them in the BingoChain.io system, things like allowing players to have more initial cards, callers to host more players etc.\n\nWe will also apply to list them on Cardano Native Token DEXs when they kick off once the Alonzo upgrade is completed. If it takes too long to get listed on at least one DEX, we may even offer buy-backs directly in the BingoChain.io system so that users can exchange their BingoTokens for ADA.\n\n \n\nDevelopment Roadmap\n\nThe BingoChain development has already completed the proof-of-concept phase and is currently in refinement phase.\n\n \n\nPhase 1 Development – Proof-of-Concept Completed\n\n• Concept Design ✓\n\n• Mint Token: 10 million tokens minted ✓\n\n• Logo Design ✓\n\n• Product Development – POC written as an Angular Application on the MEAN stack - 10 Weeks ✓\n\n• Product Testing and Private User Feedback ✓\n\n \n\nPhase 2 (Ongoing)\n\n• Community Growth\n\n• Host Public Games – Distribute Tokes and Gain User Feedback\n\n• Refine and Enhance Game Experience\n\n• Allow callers to send ADA to a Hot-Wallet as a way to provide additional ADA prizes in the caller's games\n\n• Build the distribution script to execute on game completion which should:\n\no batch all the BingoToken (and ADA if applicable) distributions into a single transaction\n\no write the game data (game id, numbers drawn, winner info, winning card numbers) to the Cardano Blockchain to provide immutable proof and auditability of the pseudo-random number generator and winning card numbers.\n\n \n\nPhase 3 (Future)\n\n• Integrate Atala Prism as a login option\n\n• Build more utility for BingoToken in the BingoChain ecosystem (see more info below)\n\n• Develop App for mobile devices\n\n• List tokens on Cardano DEX(s)\n\n• Babel Fees - Approach stake pools to support BingoToken on their pools\n\n \n\nUse of Funding\n\nCatalyst Funds will be used to make crypto or cash (ADA and USD*) prizes available in the games as a way of attracting more players to the ecosystem to jump start the BingoChain player community and the BingoToken economy. Thus, the money will all be re-invested into the platform by giving back to the community. \n\n \n\nMetrics of Success - 3 Months\n\n• Active Players in each game:\n\no an average of 20 players per game would be a good achievement\n\n• Distribution of BingoTokens through the BingoChain game ecosystem:\n\no 5K tokens distributed\n\n• Number of Callers organizing games on the BingoChain game ecosystem:\n\no 5 distinct callers from various countries\n\n \n\nMetrics of Success - 6 Months\n\n• Active Players in each game:\n\no an average of 35 players per game would be a good achievement\n\n• Distribution of BingoTokens through the BingoChain game ecosystem:\n\no 15K tokens distributed\n\n• Number of Callers organizing games on the BingoChain game ecosystem:\n\no 10 distinct callers from various countries\n\n \n\nMetrics of Success - 12 Months\n\n• Active Players in each game:\n\no an average of 50 players per game would be a good achievement\n\n• Distribution of BingoTokens through the BingoChain game ecosystem:\n\no 30K tokens distributed\n\n• Number of Callers organizing games on the BingoChain game ecosystem:\n\no 20 distinct callers from various countries","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366726-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\ncardano-tools.io: Cardano features for everyone\n\nOften things like minting, burning, tracking tokens or registering tokens in the cardano-token-registry is not accessible for non-technical users.

Not just because of the blockchain, but because of everything not on the blockchain. DAOs are a collection of traditional software, things like websites and servers, AND smart contracts, blockchain wallets, UTXOs.\n\nThe interplay between blockchain bits and traditional bits is left out. We don't have a framework that is built for the hybrid world we're entering. One that lets non-coders see the system in its entirety - lets you surf its clusters and edges without getting bogged down in white papers and thousands of lines of code. One that gives developers and participants the assurances that what they build will behave. One that gives auditors and architects alike simple tools to simulate and prove the system is acting as expected.\n\n \n\nOur Solution\n\nThat's the Visual DAO Framework. That's our mission. A three-layer approach to a new generation of services that bridge traditional software with blockchain and brings the whole community along with it.\n\nWe will build a Graph DAO framework and standards, co-developed by community programmers, mathematicians, artists, and communicators. A series of open conferences will present concepts and concerns at the beginning of each stage of the roadmap. Final acceptance will be visualization and simulation of the community selected and designed DAO use cases.  Developers will be able to simulate entire DAOs on command or safely split DAOs into modular components for feature testing.\n\nWhat could make a valid DAO?\n\nA DAO is only valid if it can be represented as a fully connected graph.\nA DAO is only valid if it defines its own external interfaces.\nA DAO is only valid if it controls its own data.\nA DAO is only valid if it can be deployed as described by the graph.\nA DAO is only valid if its behavior is as its stakeholders expect.\nA DAO is only valid if it can be simulated by its stakeholders.\n\n \n\nExample Use Cases\n\nLotteries\nDonations\n*Choosing member roles\n*System permissions handling\nSummed systems – Electing people and granting them systems access (yielding API keys, resetting account ownership off-chain)\n\n \n\nWho We Are\n\nVincent Brandon\n\nData and ML Engineer. Certified professional project manager. Development lead.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-brandon-b36b6728/\n\nRandall Harmon\n\nSoftware architect and full-stack developer. Asker of interesting questions. Architecture & Integration Lead\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/randall-harmon-aa52765/\n\nStephen Whitenstall\n\nTest management consultant for development and DAO simulation.\n\n**We are still looking for a mathematics & foundations consultant.  We want our framework to map onto established modeling paradigms.  If you are interested, please comment, DM, or find us on Discord! \n\n \n\nCommunity Growth\n\nGrowth in users at each layer. Here's how this work might help you:\n\nVoters\n\nVoters primarily interact with the visualization layer. As teams present their work, they can provide generated visualizations and active simulations to stakeholders (you!). Instead of showing a fake bunch of bubbles and lines with a great speech, development teams can present their core DAO logic as it exists in visual form, even demoing it live.\n\nDAO Participants\n\nIndividuals participating in the DAO can gain confidence in their interaction (buying stake, sending money, employment, lottery, charity, and more). Visualization allows non-technical participants to explore how their interaction impacts DAO behavior. Community auditors and security researchers peer review the dynamics of proposed DAOs.\n\nCore Developers\n\nDevelopers will use the framework to piece together their core DAO components. The framework will allow for the quick composition of the trusted (off-chain) and verified (on-chain) components and functionality via intuitive abstractions. Developers connect resource abstractions with strict functional logic and get the benefit of auto visualization, simulation, and deployment planning. Developers can be sure that the deployment targets (on-chain and off-chain interfaces, addresses, and data stores) will be community validated and enterprise-ready where possible.\n\nArtists, Designers\n\nDAOs adhering to the Framework can be fully visualized as connected graphs. These graphs can be rendered in blender, pushed to graph databases, drawn by JavaScript's Mermaid or python's Matplotlib, and more. Data journalists can tell stories of the DAO and its behavior, finding innovative ways to communicate the inner workings of the DAO starting with a valid representation of the core DAO components.\n\nArchitects\n\nSoftware architects and business leaders can translate requirements or UML into graphs directly on the visual layer, creating a wireframe for the development team. As development continues, architects have a way of verifying DAO construction intuitively, against their early visuals. Anyone can simulate the network at any time, so project managers are not in the dark about connectedness, functionality, or performance.\n\nQuality Assurance Specialists\n\nQuality control specialists have multiple ways to validate system behavior and development work. Visually, auditors can check graphs for unwanted leaves – signifying backdoors, insecure interfaces, bad data sources. Because the code is written in a framework, the simulation will fail if not constructed properly – CI/CD gets a boost with the simple simulation of the entire network without standing up heavy infrastructure. The strict nature of the framework means that testing individual edges (executing functions directly) has an easy chain to follow – visually via the graph and code.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nThe core team and consultants engage in development cycles to prepare assets for an event. This helps scope research, ideation, and development as well as provide transparent milestones to the community. All events will be recorded for public viewing.\n\n \n\nPhase 1 – Ideation, Setup, Workflow (2 Months)\n\nEvents:\n\nCC1 Community Conference: Early Use Cases (picks 3) 8/18/2021\n\nCC2 Community Conference: Architecture Concepts, Language Selection\n\nWG1 Working Group: Visual Construction of Cases\n\nWG2 Working Group: Case Primitives Review\n\nWG3 Working Group: Functional Connections of Primitives, Hybrid On/Off-chain Sub-Networks\n\n \n\nPhase 2 – Alpha Framework (2 Months)\n\nEvents:\n\nWG4 Working Group: Simulation of Primitives, Functions\n\nWG5 Working Group: POC Construction of Single Case\n\nCC3 Community Conference: Framework updates, POC, Feedback\n\n \n\nCommunity Development Events\n\nThe Cardano community is the ultimate user of Graph DAO, its tooling, and visualizations. We will offer incentives to registrants to garner insight at key steps throughout the conception and buildout of the framework layers. Community development events, community conferences, and working groups, are limited seat scoped events where the core development team will present findings, concepts, and programming patterns and get directed feedback to accelerate decision making and stakeholder alignment. Registration will be first come first serve for interested parties that submit short descriptions of why they would like to join and what they plan to contribute.\n\n \n\nCommunity Conferences ~60min (Seating limited to 10)\n\nCommunity conferences are relaxed, but focused discussions to set design parameters for the Graph DAO framework and review use cases.\n\nIncentive\n\nPrizes will be offered via lottery to participants.\n\n \n\nWorking Groups ~90min (Seating limited to 5)\n\nWorking groups are highly engaged focus groups aimed to provide specific feedback on Graph DAO framework assets, construction, and usage. Attendees will be expected to follow instructions to set up development environments and review select materials prior to attendance.\n\nIncentive\n\nParticipation fees are equally distributed to all participants.\n\n \n\nDefining Success\n\nThis project can only be successful with the help of the community.

A report will then be distributed to the Catalyst community where we can review the findings and if successful, propose a larger trial.\n\n--------IMPACT--------\n\nHow does this proposal fit into this challenge?\n\nRecognising the value of new Catalyst members by providing micro-incentives for activities that contribute to the community.\n\nHow will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?\n\nBy providing these incentives, members are encouraged to participate more frequently and in greater ways.\n\nOutlook and future challenges?\n\nA controlled pilot phase is a must for this type of proposal. A small group of 15, from a mix of members, community advisors and proposers will be selected.\n\nThe nominal incentives rate applied here will be more effective when applied to members of LCOL regions, hence, a micro-incentive averaging less than (0.x) ADA per valuable contribution is a good place to start. Values to be identified as part of the project implementation.\n\nA key objective for this proposal will be measuring daily activity.\n\nWe will do this by tracking the following:\n\nComments\nDaily Logins\nKudos\nUpvotes\nProposals Submitted\nCA specific metrics\nReferrals\n\nAt any point it becomes apparent that there is an exploit in the rewards scheme, we will pause the program until it is identified and fixed.\n\nAfter the pilot has concluded, a review will take place and a larger program may be proposed based on the results.\n\n------FEASIBILITY-------\n\nReference (Past Successes):\n\nWADA has access to a growing Catalyst member base, as well as developing their own membership platform. Through utilizing its own trusted network, reviewing applicants and using the membership platform to track activities, the pilot program has a high likelihood of successful implementation.\n\nA control group will be created to track unincentivized activities. The group is not strictly a control group as they will know they are observed and may change their behavior, but this will at least provide a comparison.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nAfter funding is successfully secured:\n\nFirst 30 days - Program is finalized and rates are set for each activity type\nApplications are opened and participants are identified (15 days)\nExpected public launch, Jan 15th\n60-day duration - Rewards program begins, in conjunction with a new funding cycle, if possible.\n\nPost-program:\n\n(7-day duration) Data is collated, feedback is received from all participants and a report is created for the Catalyst community to review the results and decide whether or not to extend the program to a second, larger trial.\n\nCore Team & Roles:\n\nJosh F - Project Coordinator and Finance Lead @ Wada\n\nMercy - Community Moderator and Coordination Lead @ Wada\n\nSidney - Developer Liaison and Diaspora Lead @ Wada\n\n+ WADA Team\n\nBudget breakdown:\n\nIncentives $5000\n\nAdmin fees $3000\n\nDeveloper and platform fees $1000\n\nMarketing $500\n\n--------AUDITABILITY----------\n\nWhat success looks like:\n\nThe right balance of micro-incentives and increased participation will mean that the program can be extended to a larger group.\n\n3 months: Program finalized and launched, rates set, and platform developed \n6 months: Program completed, incentives distributed and feedback gathered\n12 months: Second iteration of the program launched, with a larger user base and higher utilization of software tools for both tracking and disbursements\n\nKey Metrics:\n\nAverage daily rewards gained (mean and mode)  \n\n \n\nAverage activity metrics (mean and mode) \n\n \n\n% difference in average activity metrics, test group vs control group (proxy for increased participation rate) \n\n \n\n% Daily contributors\n\n \n\nApproval rating from participants  \n\n \n\nNo. Likely to participate again \n\n \n\nNo. self-identified as ' fairly rewarded'\n\n \n\n \n\nRisk Management:\n\nAccess to Activity Data: Accessing the ideascale API and understanding what data can be utilized will be needed to avoid self-reporting.

We are unique in the way we will bring together the different sectors of the film industry (authors, actors, agencies, producers, etc.) and provide a fair and equitable environment. We will ensure privacy and safety for all industry participants by creating a structure that rewards positive contributions by participants. But COLLUDE is not just a platform for networking and sharing, as there are already many in the industry. The platform is not merely a large database of profiles of actors. Rather, it is a system where the origin and ownership of values are logged and made traceable in tandem with the casting and production processes.\n\nBy utilizing the Cardano network, values can be mapped, access rights can be transferred unambiguously and permanently from one user to another, and our system acts only as an intermediary. Rights to real-world assets can also be mapped digitally in the blockchain and thus traded. This opens up enormous automation potential. Until now, it is the case that on average between 20% and 50% of the invested capital is lost in every film production due to inefficient processes, costly casting, duplicate administrative, and distribution structures. The innovation of COLLUDE's business model is to redefine the industry conditions and reward structures for participants. We will begin with a grass-roots drive to bring amateur and aspiring actors, screenwriters, and directors to the platform, creating a groundswell of talent. We will progressively market the platform up the food chain as we build adoption, with the eventual goal of being the go-to medium for all production studios and funding ventures. COLLUDE will charge a modest fee for enterprises to use the platform, more than making up for itself through huge efficiency gains compared to the present industry standards. We envisage that a sizable proportion of the platform fees collected from professional and industry users will be re-invested into creative invective structures for beginner and aspiring participants, thus ultimately creating a positive-feedback-loop that strengthens the platform from the ground up.\n\n2. The Technology\n\nThe lynchpin of COLLUDE's strategy is the technology that makes our business model possible. Our innovation lies in utilizing and integrating three pillars - software architecture – cutting-edge AI - and decentralized blockchain technology. The software architecture can be defined at an abstract level as being the organization and interaction of all elements of a software system. By including a wide variety of principles, such as conceptual integrity, separation of responsibilities, visibility, and/self-organization, this structure can be made long-lasting and future-proof. This is especially relevant for those systems that are subject to a certain evolution and need to be constantly developed. While not in-and-of-itself revolutionary, our approach is to implement a best-practice design that allows for future scalability. Therefore, the mere development and implementation of a generic software system are not enough. COLLUDE uses an event-based architecture style and the CQRS (Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation) pattern. Our architecture is based on so-called microservices, which act autonomously and manage their own area of responsibility. On the one hand, this software architecture allows unpredictable requirements (functionalities) to be implemented, while on the other hand allowing for the integration of the latest technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, etc. Furthermore, in addition to its high adaptability and flexibility, the software architecture also affords a high degree of scaling potential in order to react efficiently and effectively to unpredictable user requests. (Graphical representation in the appendix) The development of AI is based on two different developments:\n\nThe development of a classical matching algorithm (recommendation engine); and\nNLG (natural language Generation ).\n\nIn COLLUDE, a transformer architecture (GPT 3 model) is used for the NLG. This is a pre-trained model, which is very powerful but also very general. The challenge in the development is to adapt it for COLLUDE-specific service and provide a toolkit to help actors and writers practice their arts . We'll also be using text recognition to transform the inherent structure in film scripts into usable data. The enriched data then flows together in a classical matching algorithm. Preliminary work is already progressing on both parts of the AI. The challenge will be to fully implement them in the software architecture. Finally, the Cardano blockchain will provide the architecture for users to transfer and transact, verify, and trust. Given that the network and its scaling solutions are still works-in-progress, we are also yet to finalize our full implementation strategy. However, use cases such as allowing users to pay and collect revenue using crypto-assets (native and wrapped), attach rights to data (NFTs), verify identity (DID), and transact fairly (business logic) will all be implemented into the platform as it develops. We intend for all such useful functions which are facilitated by COLLUDE to take place over the Cardano network (and its scaling solutions). We envisage that as COLLUDE and the Cardano network both grow, further use-cases will evolve and we want to create a platform that can quickly pivot to utilize the latest trends. By allowing users to interact with the platform via their own crypto-wallet, we will be further empowering the film-making industry from the ground up, while aligning to the greater goal of the crypto-currency space: financial independence for every person.\n\nMarket Information\n\nFilm Costs/Time\n\nA 20min Short film Cost 5.000 - 35.000 Euro\nThe risks are too high when creating a film\nPlanning is analog with unreliable data\n\nActors\n\nActors have a 0.04% chance of finding a role\nActors don't get paid enough for time on set\n\nScreenplay Writers\n\nWriters have a 0.3% chance of their screenplay being seen\nWriters don't get royalties for the Idea they created\n\nProducers\n\nProducers have problems finding the right screenplays\nProducers have problems finding the right actors\nProducers can't find specialists to work on set\n\nThrough the involvement of numerous third parties. There is No trust, transparency, or quality control throughout the process of film development. Because of these factors, many artists in the film industry suffer the consequences.\n\nHow We Do It\n\nBuilding the Film industry from the bottom-up won't be an easy task. However, The Use of First principle thinking and a Bottom-Up approach: to build a self-sustaining ecosystem will help achieve the goal. To do develop the system here a couple of examples of specific questions we ask:\n\nQUESTION:\"What elements are needed for a film? \"\n\nThe answer:\n\nThe Idea - Screenplay Writer\n\n \n\nCaptivating & Internalising The Idea - Actors,\n\n \n\nVisualizing The Idea - Director Of Photography with camera crew:  \n\n \n\nOrganizing The Idea - Producers ***\n\n \n\nFilm Funding Entities - Film Funding Entities***\n\n \n\n \n\n*** These elements can be replaced through the use of technology which is more efficient, organizing and funding can be provided in many different ways***\n\nQUESTION: \"What overarching elements are needed in all sectors? \"\n\nThe answer:\n\nStarting out (First Steps) - Focuses on the users' orientation, helping them better understand the film industry. Using documentation, video, and other communication mediums, collude provides transparency, which will help new artists get the information they need.\n\nSelf-help - provides the artist's infrastructure to improve and get feedback on their performance and create a future outlook\nMaking Money (Monetisation) - enabling the artist to use their talents to find or create the perfect working opportunity\nWorking Methods and Connectivity - is a more straightforward and efficient way to work using more collaborative tools. Direct contact and efficient exchange of information helps the artist to work together.\nBuilding trust & Transparency - with the data that collude gathers. It is possible to create quarterly/yearly market reports endorsing a fair playing field for all.\n\nThe Platform will first focus on empowering these elements for Screenplay Writers, Actors, Directors & Camera Crew and in the future, other stakeholders that are necessary for film development such as costume, sound effects etc. Providing an architecture that enhances organization and equity. This architecture creates a swarm effect in which the decentralized collective can achieve any goal.\n\nWhy Cardano?\n\nCollude's mission statement is \"We listen\". Listening is the major part of our strategy and market approach. It's crucial to create a safe domain in which the community can easily & safely communicate their hardships and pains. Through listening, it's possible to create an environment in which knowledge is shared with the possibility to collaborate toward a common purpose or even creating ​​ a sense of urgency to help others to get involved and attain meaningful goals. Listening is the first stage in building a collective identity that is distinctive throughout the market. The Cardano Ecosystem has a lot of parallels with the goals we want to achieve and the technology stack fits perfectly to the platform.\n\nPlatform Model & Technology Use\n\nFor Colludes revenue is based on a subscription model - 50% of the revenue provided by subscriptions will be automatically allocated to USER's wallet as ADA ( Flowchart ). This is only done after the user has activated his or her own wallet because the wallet is essential to participating in the ecosystem. The ecosystem is interactions primarily based on the functionalities of the wallet.\n\nWallet Uses:\n\nVoting on: Collude Platform development, Commenting/Reviewing Projects, Film Projects development, & Film Project Funding\nIncome: Staking & Other means of income (i.e Defi - Loan, Credit, Collateral )\nNFT's - Auctioning, Buying and Licensing Screenplays,\nApprovals & Reviews, Starting Film projects, etc.\nTechnology Stack:\n Blockchain- Creating trust and transparency\nEnabling screenplay writers & other parties to safely store and track their Ideas as it's being created.\n\nCreating film development Dapps/Tools\n\nNFT's - For distinction & verification\nEnabling Users to buy, sell & license i.e. -screenplays with the ability to earn royalties\nUsing QR Codes to verify the legitimacy of screenplay owners\nAutomation entities to automate complicated procedures.\nFor each party involved, we will create 2-3 Standard open contracts enabling users to choose what best fits their needs.\nContracts are automatically executed after conditions are met for parties involved\nDefi - Providing equity, liquidity, and capital for platform users:\nFilm Project Funding\nIndividual Platform Users\n\nA.I. - helps to answer these questions:\n\nWhat is a screenplay?\nWhat is the screenplay value?\nWhat objects are in the screenplay? and how can they be valued?\nWhat actors are in the screenplay? the actors' descriptions?\nIs it possible to find Actors for certain acting roles (if the user chooses)\nIs it possible to make acting scenes for actors to practice? (GPT3)\n\nActors & Writers: User Journey\n\nActors\n\nStarting out (First Steps) - After creating a user profile as seen in the click dummy . Actors have the ability to view personalized screenplays based on their profiles. The Screenplays will be generated based on the matching algorithm or determined from producers/agencies who are Self-help & Working Methods and Connectivity - looking for actors for a film project. Actors are also able to:\n\nPractice screenplays that have been generated by the algorithm.\nWatch other actors casting videos who have been cast for the same role\nPick casting partners for scene dialog\nView diverse screenplays and other actors which have been cased\nImproved castings videos through the help of mentors\n\nBuilding trust & Transparency - Each video the actor records the metadata will be added to the blockchain for future validation. After casting has been processed actors will automatically be notified (smartphone) if their casting video has been accepted for the project. A process that is not shown in the click dummy is the selection of the actor's terms and conditions regarding their contact- there will be 2-3 different contact types that actors can select. The contracts are saved in the wallet for later use and before the film project is started all have the ability to view their contact and their signature will be made through the use of the wallet password.\n\nMaking Money (Monetisation) - If actors have been accepted into the project it enables them to start working without being uncertain of contractual obligations\n\nScreenplay Writers\n\nStarting out (First Steps) & Self-help & Working Methods and Connectivity - After the writer's profile has been created. The writer has the possibility to:\n\nFind Ideas for screenplays\nWrite a screenplays\nAllow screenplays to be reviewed & revised\nCollaborate on screenplays\nUpload a screenplay on the platform\nSell, License, & Auction Screenplays\n\nBuilding trust & Transparency - Certain metadata about the screenplay is saved on the blockchain. When a screenplay is uploaded the platform algorithm verifies and checks the database for duplicates or screenplays with the same characteristics. The individual users are notified if conflicts occur. All screenplays created on the platform will be created with QR codes which will help to certify the screenplays. If the QR code is scant it will display the data regarding ownership of the screenplay and other relevant information.\n\nMaking Money (Monetisation) - After the screenplay has been created. At the user's disposal, they can sell their screenplays (NFT) for a monetary value or create a project enabling actors to join with the ability to produce the screenplay.\n\nOur Goals\n\nThrough empowering artists, it enables them to be the backbone of the film industry Purpose and achieve the following goals\nCreating a safety net and guidance for film industry participants\nEnables artists to have economic freedom throughout the film industry.\nEnables new Ideas and content to be present to end consumers\nDecoupling the film developing processes from centralized powers\nBuilding Transparency & Trust throughout the film industry\nMinimizing cost and time for film development\nLogging the origin and ownership of values and making them transparently traceable.\nEnabling \"win/win\" situation for the participants in film making\nCreating a plethora of diverse ideas for screenplays\n\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\n\nShawn Böhm - Product Development\nPatrick Braun - Computer Science\nDr. Victor Molina - Agile Coach\nDaniel Gawlowski - Actor\n\nOUR STATUS\n\nSo, What's DONE\n\nAt the moment we are a team of ten volunteers, in the progress of creating a company\nTeam members:\n3x Developers, 1x Business Developer, 1x Business & Community Developer, 2x Designers -Brand UI/UX, 1x Kapital Allocation & Monetisation, 1x Business Strategy & Vision\nTwo team members are working full time on the project\nPitch Deck\nVIEW -> Click Dummy https://xd.adobe.com/view/e2d8f3d5-2fbc-45b4-98d4-d9d542330b91-b78b/\nWebsite-  https://collude.online/\nBasic Problem Explanation Video\n\nWhat We Need\n\nDevelopers from the Haskell Ecosystem/ Plutus Pioneer\nTechnology Wizards\nSoftware Developer from the Haskell Ecosystem/ Plutus Pioneer\nDefi Developers\nPartnerships\nCollaborators\nInsider Knowledge (Film Industry)\nCapital\n\nDEFINITION OF SUCCESS\n\nMilestones- 🏁\n\nCommunity Development -\n\n🏁 Individual Surveys - Actors, Writers, Screenplay Writers, Directors (around - 500 participants)\n🏁 Creating Community Platform (Discord - around 500 active participants)\n\nChannel for listening to the Community\nIdea Creation - Solutions\nCollude Platform Feature Channels\nCommunity Feedback Channels\nInformational Content Creation\n\n🏁 Audio & Video Information Channels:\n\nFilm Industry How to's Guide and first (Audio & Video)\nRecorded 1hour Interviews (around 50 - 100 ) Young Talents (day to day life - understanding & addressing problems)\nActors, Screenplay Writers, Directors, Producers, etc\nInterviews with Professionals (around 50 - 100):\nActors, Screenplay Writers, Directors, Producers, etc\n\nTechnology\n\n🏁 Onboarding Technology Projects, Partners and Collaborators\n\n-  nft-maker (✅)\n-  mirqur.io (✅)\n-  namiwallet.io/)( ()\n-  mukn.io/ (✅)\n-  clearcontracts (✅)\n\n🏁 Product Market Fit (Calibration and Evaluation)\n\n🏁Build MVP\n\nFrontEnd\nOnboarding - Actors, Screenplay Writers\nUser Workflow (Actors (Onboarding -> Casting) & Screenplay Writers (upload Screenplay, KI-Analyse Screenplay, Licensing/Selling Screenplays))\nWallet UI (Actors and Screenplays)\nBackend\nCloud- and API-Security\nVideo Processing (Casting)\nScreenplay Safeguard (blockchain)\nScreenplay & Actors matching Algorithm (A.I)\nWallet Integration\nSoftware-Architecture\nCI/CD\nCloud Services\nVirtual Machines\nObject Storage\n\n(Extra 🎯 ) Additional Features:\n\nADA - Pool\nSubscription Payment Channel\nBasic Wallet Voting Elements\nScreenplays as NFT along with QR codes\nThe use of Defi as Liquidity to finance projects (outline)\nBasic Smart Contract functionalities\nContracts\nFeedback loop\n\n- link between Community and Technology\n\nRoadmap:\n\n1.

On the fungible side PlayerMint creates prize pools of a token called PMX. These prize pools get distributed out to gamers based on their in-game performance on popular titles like Fortnite, CS:GO, and Splitgate every 5 days or epoch. PMX is strictly earned via gameplay performance and there is no requirement for the user to spend money in order to interact with the system. This means there is no potential for monetary loss regarding gameplay performance.\n\n \n\nOn the non-fungible side PlayerMint features its own NFT marketplace. This is the gamers spot to mint their own crypto-assets to be traded and transacted on the open marketplace all through the token they earn via gameplay performance. This creates a token system economy fueled by gameplay and creativity all on top of Cardano.\n\n \n\nWhat are Community Access NFTs?\n\nIn short, a way to enable exclusive access within a community through digital scarcity that can be earned, given, bought, and traded. Imagine your favorite content creator minted their own set of NFTs that not only had strong visual appeal but also offered unique benefits. For example you got to be a part of their next video, earned a role in their Discord with special permissions, and got a VIP badge on their Twitch. Community Access NFTs provide deeper engagement in a way that creates a positive relationship between creator and fan. The creator of course makes money through enabling this engagement and the fan can sell the NFT if they no longer want the access it provides them.\n\n \n\nA prominent example of Community Access NFTs is what Gary Vaynerchuck is doing with VeeFriends. VeeFriends is an NFT project that grants its holder benefits in the form of access to Gary and what he's up to. Every single VeeFriend acts as a ticket to VeeCon, a business based conference, for 3 years. Specific VeeFriends offer additional benefits like the \"Video Game Vulture\" that enable its holders to play video games with Gary in person.\n\n \n\nIn the past week 162 VeeFriends have been sold at an average price of $64.9k leading to a sales volume of $10.52m (at time of writing). All these sales benefit Gary, but they mostly benefit the token holders.\n\n \n\nBringing Gamers to Cardano\nMany creators and gamers are very crypto curious or have already joined the movement. One of the largest esports org founders, Banks of FaZe Clan, is already sporting a CryptoPunk as his Twitter profile picture. This isn't surprising as gamers are digital natives. They understand the value of digital items and are already buying cosmetics for their in-game characters and subscriptions for emotes on their favorite creators' Twitch channels. The jump to a token earned from gameplay performance and NFTs that provide further community access is an easy one for gamers and creators alike.\n\n \n\nLaunch Status\n\nThe PlayerMint project is currently being developed with lots of progress being made on its design. Because PlayerMint has not launched yet this proposal describes the team's objectives, key metrics, roadmap, and budget for before and after the launch of the product. A full product launch is expected around December of 2021.\n\n \n\nPre-Launch\n\nObjectives\n\nEducation for creators and gamers on the basics of blockchain and quality NFT projects. This education will focus on using games as an analogy for how the technology works. For example explaining Bitcoin mining through Minecraft.\nOnce creators are educated the PlayerMint team will offer free consultation on constructing a quality community access NFT strategy. This will involve tokenomics, utility, and marketing so that the creator is ready to mint on PlayerMint once the product is live. \nThe PlayerMint team will maintain a list of all creators ready to launch their community access NFT strategies as well as keep in close contact with them.\n\n \n\nKey Metrics\n\nThe number of creators and gamers educated about blockchain/NFTs.\nTotal onboarded creators audience size.\nThe number of community access NFT strategies created.\n\n \n\nRoadmap and Budget\n\n$13k of the total requested funds will go towards the development of the NFT mint and marketplace on PlayerMint. This development is currently taking place and the requested funds would go towards its completion.\n\nRoadmap - Effective Immediately: \n\n1. Creation of educational materials for creators and gamers\n\n2. Distribution of educational materials\n\n3. Strategize with creators for post-launch\n\n4. Maintain contact with creators\n\n \n\nPost-Launch\n\nObjectives\n\nExecute all community access NFT strategies made by creators under the consultation of PlayerMint. Ensure the creators are able to do an equitable NFT launch that creates excitement in their community that can be maintained for the long term.\nMarket and maintain the community access NFT strategies by focusing on helping the creator interact with their community, sell their NFTs, and increase overall engagement. \n\n \n\nKey Metrics (3 / 6 / 12 Months)\n\nThe revenue generated by creators: $40k / $100k / $1m\n\nThe number of creators and gamers onboarded to Cardano: 10k / 50k / 125k\n\nThe number of NFTs minted by creators: 5k / 12k / 50k\n\nThe volume of secondary market sales: $10k / $65k / $2m\n\n \n\nRoadmap and Budget\n\n$2k of the total requested funds will go towards enabling the PlayerMint team to help market community access NFT strategies. This marketing will be done in full collaboration with the creators in order to create mutual benefit between all parties involved. Any and all marketing materials associated with a community access NFT strategy will be approved by the strategies creator.\n\nRoadmap - Effective at Product Launch: \n\n1. Begin execution of community access NFT strategies\n\n2. Market community access NFT strategies with creators\n\n3. Maintain contact and support for creators\n\n4. Attract more creators\n\n5. Repeat\n\n \n\nMeet the Team\n\nGrant Scholl - Chief Executive Officer\n\nHas 2 years of experience in gaming and 4 years in blockchain. He works to build out the ultimate vision of PlayerMint and how it will evolve overtime.\n\n \n\nJohn Rousseau - Chief Operating Officer\n\nHas 34 years of experience in gaming and 2 years in blockchain. He works to maintain the internal company and ensure operations are running smoothly.\n\n \n\nAidan Rankin-Williams - Chief Experience Officer\n\nHas 2 years of experience in gaming and 3 years in blockchain. He works to form the user experience from first contact marketing to engagement across the product and customer support.\n\n \n\nJack Rousseau - Growth Manager\n\nHas just begun his journey in gaming and blockchain. He works to grow the community through the use of social media, networking, and events.\n\n \n\nGreg Fox - Strategic Advisor\n\nHas 7 years of experience in gaming and 1 year in blockchain. He works to provide advice and guidance as to how the project should progress and establish quality lines of revenue.\n\n \n\nRevenue Model\n\nThe PlayerMint revenue model has been constructed with the sustainability and longevity of the project in mind. PlayerMint mints PMX every 5 days. This means the years supply of tokens are minted in 73 separate epochs. Each epoch 80% of the minted tokens will fund the prize pool for gamers to get paid to play. The other 20% of the minted tokens will be distributed to the PlayerMint Team. For the NFT side of things the creator will obtain 98% of all initial market sales along with any royalties they set for secondary market sales. PlayerMint will take 2% of all NFT sales, both initial and secondary. Once the supply cap of PMX is hit this 2% of NFT sales will go towards funding prize pools for gamers to get paid to play. This revenue model aligns incentives between the PlayerMint Team and community. In order for the Team to have sustainable revenue the community must be receiving meaningful payouts of PMX and see reason to mint and trade NFTs.\n\n \n\nMint Condition Example\n\nThanks for reading the PlayerMint team's proposal! To finish things off here is a fictional example of what community access NFTs could accomplish for a gaming content creator:\n\n \n\nLovelace is a Youtube streamer with a total community size of 25k. She averages about 1k concurrent viewers per stream and gets quality engagement from her chat. Lovelace decides that it is time to quit her 9 to 5 and go full time on her passions in gaming and content creation. She needs to be making more money to do this but wants to avoid an increase in ads. Instead she turns to PlayerMint. Lovelace starts getting paid to play and encourages her community to do the same. After a month of this Lovelace starts minting her own community access NFTs that offer benefits like playing with her on stream and getting 1 free piece of merch every month. Lovelace is now financially stable from PMX payouts from gameplay performance and royalties from secondary market NFT sales that scale with her community size. \n\n \n\nLinks\nWhitepaper and Other Documentation: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1pE-ovr4skgZnzte2qzMmWuN_kk16CzW_\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kPUW2e4CCz \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/theplayermint","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366761-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nPlease reference the attached proposal for a detailed description of project objectives, approach, expectations, risks, and expenses.\n-----------Overview---------------\n\nCASK provides incentives to Africans for performing the basic tasks of becoming Cardano stakeholders, and demonstrating the utility of the Cardano blockchain.\nThe initial release will focus on providing 'rewards cards,' in the form of Cardano Community Tokens, that can be exchanged at participating retail partners. The retail partner can then return the tokens for fiat and keep the remaining ADA as profit (currently, Cardano requires that 1.59 ADA is sent in this type of Community Token transaction)\nFuture releases will explore new business models made available with advancements in the Cardano blockchain. This may include stablecoins, smart contracts, and/or Babel fees to create new incentive structures that can reduce operating costs while still incentivizing users and retail partners.\nInspiration for this initiative comes in part from the success of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, where a grassroots effort led to (at first) hyperlocal Bitcoin acceptance as currency, and eventually to countrywide adoption. Similar opportunities exist for Cardano in Africa where cryptocurrency/blockchain awareness is still limited. The Cardano Foundation's commitment to Africa adoption, along with existing grassroots initiatives like WADA, provide a solid foundation from which to successfully develop CASK.\n\n-----------Impact---------------\nHow does this proposal's problem statement fit the challenge? (slide 2-3)\n\nThis project directly promotes expanding Cardano's utility in Africa, and provides financial incentives to Africans that use Cardano's capabilities.\n\nHow will this proposal add value to the Cardano ecosystem? (slide 9)\n\nDemonstrating Cardano's utility in Africa is critical to progressing Cardano's vision on the continent. Cardano must reach critical mass in order to reach its true potential. A means of gaining traction is via establishing network effects at local levels, then expanding.\n\nHow will the proposal scale to address future challenges? (slide 7)\n\nWhile initial business models have been identified for a Phase 1 launch, CASK expects to leverage innovations in future Cardano releases to improve its financial model. This may include: Smart Contracts, Babel Fees, Stablecoins, and DeFi innovations defined by the Cardano community.\n\n-----------Feasibility---------------\nTeam (slide 12-13)\n\nWest Africa Decentralized Alliance (WADA): Skilled team of Cardano practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across West Africa and the diaspora.\nJon Saginaw: 20+ years experience in Technology Consulting, working with some of the world's most well-known companies.

We have made the following amendments with community input.\n\nInstead creating space that community can come to, we will start by doing more outreach work\nRent spaces for big events as needed.\nMake use of some co-working spaces initially as appropriate\n\nThanks to Steve Lockhart and Gwendal Le Divechen for their help putting the original proposal together and for continuing to champion this proposal.\nPurpose of the Project Proposal\n\n\nAs with the Cardano ecosystem in general, in Africa there are parallel threads that need to be working simultaneously. First and foremost among them are the basic infrastructure needs that many in the western world take for granted, but are often things that African localities do not commonly have available at a level that will support the development of such a highly technical ecosystem.   \n\n\n Internet access that will support inter-hub and international cyber-meetings as well as stake-pool operations is something that must be pursued and acquired. Electrical supply with UPS integration and backup generators is also something that must be secured as local power companies are often subject to brownouts/blackouts.  \n\n\n In addition to those basic needs are also the hardware required to support developers, teachers, students and the associated community outreach each hub is planning. \n\n\n The following list in details what should be standard equipment and services for our community hubs:    \n\n\n\n Facility – (Rental / Maintenance.)\n Power – (Equipment/Installations/Rental/Fuel/Maintenance) \nInternet – (adequate for world communication and stake pool operation)\nNetworks – (Equipment/Installations/Rental/Subscription)\nInsurance - (Safety / Fire / Hazards)\nWorkstations connected to screens for classes, printers, etc.\n Desks, tables, chairs \n\n\nThe funds requested for the support of the hubs (investment costs + 3 months recurring costs) will be administered by WADA and will be made available to the individual hubs according to a phased deployment plan . Partner hubs are people with whom we have developed a relationship over the last few months and with whom we share the same goals.\n\n Main Deliverable:\n\nAccelerate the creation of dapps and attract new developers into the Cardano ecosystem who are attuned to solving local problems.\n\n \n --------***--IMPACT--***---------\nHow does the proposal fit into this challenge?\n\n Africa presents immense opportunity for Cardano blockchain adoption however, the continent's well-documented barriers to adoption could hamper the design of cutting edge digital solutions and the growth of Cardano in Africa. This proposal will Grow Cardano by ensuring the best ground solutions emerges and entrenches Cardano's cutting-edge solutions in the Sub Saharan Africa region. With focus on:\n\n\nInfrastructure (main purpose of this proposal \nEducation\nOutreach\n\n  How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?\n\nBy supporting and developing these activities, WADA will, thanks to its role as link between people and initiatives, help to simplify and boost the creation and deployment of innovative solutions.\n\n-------***---FEASIBILITY--***-------\nReference & Past Successes:\n\nIn August WADA completed a widely successful Proposer outreach program event, significantly increasing our visibility as the go-to for mentoring and onboarding new developers and entrepreneurs from Africa and diaspora. https://twitter.com/jaycidiq/status/1432106218923888640\n8 unique country Africa and diaspora hubs with expanding teams\nA membership platform in development for onboarding and virtual & in person training sessions\nMentors and experts willing to support both the goals of WADA and Cardano\n\nRoadmap\n1-3 months post funding\n\nSix local fit- for-purpose physical spaces acquired throughout West and Central Africa with internet access, stable electricity, and computers\n\n4-6 months post funding\n\nThe local hubs/centres are up and running under competent leadership. Each hub is uniquely delivering according to the needs and opportunities of their communities. Organizing recurring events, education in functional programming and blockchain technology (for all ages) and community outreach and events.\n\n6 months to one year\n\nHubs are fully functional and specialized to serve local and national needs\n Hubs are networked with other international hubs to leverage each other's strengths, share learning, and increase accountability.\nAll WADA planned activities to expand Cardano's market in sub-Saharan Africa such as government and academic outreach, dApp creations/business solutions, and creative enterprises in full implementation\nCollaborative projects with other projects in the Cardano ecosystem are being executed seamlessly on the ground.\n\nBudget:$57,000\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1USLtlJPD2u0oNauv8lRgVF89VP1hVVHTz9R8R-jPkeo/edit?usp=sharing\n \nRisk assessment\nAs part of our risk assessment process, we identified 3 main areas that require specific attention :\n\n Legalization: some African administrations are strong in harassing new businesses.\n Coordination/standards.\n Cost over-run.\n\nThe possible risk management solutions:\n1.Legalization:\n\nObtain a legal document from which the WADA hubs would be operating. With numerous trade agreements overlapping, a copy of this document can be used for operations anywhere.\nSet up new hubs in existing offices or close to a partner developer's office. This would not only give legitimacy in the eyes of potential users, but government officials will not easily distinguish the new business as it will be collaborating with the established one.\nCrypto currencies are unregulated in many countries, WADA will ensure adherence to local regulation to any extent possible\n\n2. Coordination/standards:\n\nIssue standards common to each partner hubs.\n Hire the services of local lawyers. Laws in many African countries are relatively similar with standards such as OHADA (Organization for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa).\n Identification stickers to put on all material goods so as to establish ownership. A shared logo, paint and color themes can help ensure the motivation of participants who need to not only see themselves as members of one small hub but members of one large network. These standards will be visually visible through video calls.\nThe coordinating team must be physically aware of the experience on the ground. At least a visit mid-project to each hub. Ideally, the same person/team would visit all hubs to establish a common assessment.\n\n3. Cost over-runs\n\nStarting a new business/office has unexpected costs. This needs to be taken into account.\nAdditional to forming new hubs, also find an established business dealing with programming and digital products to partner with.\nActors would need to be compensated. For example, the coordination team. But also, the \"lead\" of each hub, even if it is a business owner. These costs can be symbolic and need not cover the full extend of their involvement as they are either already interested or employed. This will ensure that their keep their focus on the hub.\nTo ensure functionality, cost items must be arranged in order of priority. We do not want to have bought laptops and printers only to find that there is no money for the office. Ideally, the ranking will ensure that the office can maintain some level of functionality.\n\n \n--------AUDITABILITY-------\nWhat success looks like:\n\nSignificant Cardano market expansion in all current and future WADA-active countries through solutions design/ dApp creation, education & outreach, and continuous capacity/capability building.

For example, payments of earned commissions in affiliate programs, payouts to investors, or payments to a team of freelancers working on a project. Unfortunately, none of the existing popular Cardano wallets allow this. ADAPlus will make mass payments with minimum fees and a minimum investment of time possible.\n\nThe minimum transaction fee in Cardano is about 0.17₳. With a large number of payments to different addresses, it can add up to a significant amount. The fee depends on the amount of information sent in a transaction, typically about 300 bytes. The transaction cost calculation for Cardano is as follows: a base price is 0.155381₳ per transaction and 0.000043946₳ per transferred byte. The maximum size of one transaction is limited to 16kb, resulting in a maximum fee of about 0.875₳. With the help of ADAPlus, one fully-packed transaction can accommodate about 50 payments to different addresses. Such mass transactions will save you fees. For example, when making payments using a regular wallet, you would pay at least 8.5₳ for 50 separate payments that would require a lot of work copying and pasting addresses and amounts. Combining 50 payments into one transaction will only cost about 0.8₳, providing savings of more than 10x.\n\nADAPlus will enable you to send any number of payments to multiple recipients in one click.\n\n \n\nThe workflow\n\nThe user logs into the ADAPlus website and imports a file containing the list of addresses and payments. After loading the list of addresses, the system retrieves and analyzes a significant amount of information from the blockchain to provide detailed information about the owners of addresses on the list. Such information will include the wallet creation date (first transaction), staking and pool delegation history, and the maximum value of the wallet, etc.\n\nThen the user can work with the list, add or remove addresses, or adjust payment amounts according to various parameters. It is also possible to send a transaction's metadata (message) with the transaction. For example, the sender can thank recipients or include the payout identifier for affiliate programs. We will use extended CIP-0020 that can also send separate messages to different UTxOs.\n\nADAPlus allows pool operators to get a list of delegators per epoch. Then, SPOs, willing to reward their delegators, can send additional individual rewards based on delegators' loyalty, amounts of delegated funds, history, newcomers, etc. This feature alone provides a lot of possibilities for new marketing campaigns to attract new delegators.\n\nADAPlus calculates and displays the minimum amount required to make all payments. In addition, it optimizes the structure of the transaction to keep fees as low as possible. For example, in the case of many addresses that cannot fit into one transaction, the service will reorganize and split payments into multiple transactions that have the lowest fees.\n\n \n\nWallets\n\nThere are three approaches that ADAPlus can provide, and they require different experience levels.\n\nBeginner level\n\nThe most straightforward way to provide mass-payments tools to clients is to create and store wallets on the ADAPlus side. The client only needs to send a calculated total amount to the address before performing mass payments. In that case, ADAPlus will take care of optimizing/splitting/packing payments into transactions, adding metadata, and signing & submitting transactions to the network. No technical knowledge is required from the client.\n\nRisks and obstacles: This approach has risks associated with storing private keys to make transactions.\n\nIntermediate level\n\nThe client can pass a final list of addresses and amounts to his wallet like Yoroi, Daedalus, AdaLite, Medusa. The wallet will take care of calculating fees, combining UTxOs, and sending funds.\n\nRisks and obstacles: This has the lowest risk level. The only problem is that none of the current popular wallets allow those features. However, we have already started discussing a possible implementation of that feature that will, in the long run, benefit not only ADAPlus but the whole ecosystem. So we are willing to start working on a standard for passing payments that all wallets can implement.\n\nExpert level\n\nADAPlus will generate copy-paste bash instructions that will run on any machine with cardano-cli installed and a node running. All private keys are stored on the client's side.\n\nRisks and obstacles: Some users, such as pool operators, are familiar with working from a command line and may prefer this for maximum transparency. But for Luddites installing a node and even copy-pasting commands will be a challenge.\n\nThe order of implementation\n\nWe will start with implementing the third Expert level as it does not require a lot of development time, it's transparent, and does not require \"trust\" in sending funds to ADAPlus wallets. We want to avoid any risks associated with holding clients' money. Because of that, we will be asking clients not to store their funds on ADAPlus, but to top up a required amount and perform payments right after that. We hope popular wallets see the potential of sending mass payment transactions and implement a bridge in the form of a URL scheme link or a QR code.\n\n \n\nUse cases\n\nMarketing tool for Pool Operators - Mass payments to existing or new delegators\n\nUnlike other blockchain explorers targeted towards transaction details or pool information, ADAPlus will also work as an explorer aimed at addresses and delegators. Any pool can get a list of its delegators per any epoch using flexible search filters. Lists with delegators' addresses can be saved or exported for future mass payments. Those features will allow SPOs to run different flexible marketing campaigns. As an example, you can guarantee your delegators will get 6% ROI rewards for zero-blocks epochs. A VICE pool is already using the ADAPlus platform for epochs calculations and performing mass payments. Conditions can be more flexible. For example, new delegators will get additional fixed amounts based on the gradation of the stake they provide. On significant dates, SPO may reward its most loyal delegators. ADAPlus saves a lot of time for pool operators and makes such marketing campaigns simple.\n\nDelegators directory - search, filtering, analysis\n\nADAPlus will have a pools directory and a delegators directory. The pools directory is aimed to promote smaller SPOs running mission-driven pools or offering marketing benefits to delegators. It will not use a rating similar to Daedalus or AdaPools that provides benefits only to saturated popular pools. Pool owners can register subdomains in the system with the name of their ticker and display pool stats, announcements, and current promotions. Along with a pools directory, ADAPlus will have a catalog of delegators with a rating, depending on the delegated amount, delegation history, transactions history, wallet creation time, and some other parameters. This directory will provide pool operators with a tool to shape their marketing policies and run tests and calculations. For example, you can determine the average amount of delegation to a staking pool, the activity of using Cardano by delegates, and to find out what events influenced the transition of a group of users to another pool. In addition, it is possible to study delegators' behavior locally for one specific pool and globally as general user movement patterns under different events. For instance, when luck in pools decreases for several consequent epochs or when the commission percentage rises.\n\nPayouts from affiliate marketing\n\nAs cryptocurrency adoption grows, many online affiliate programs start to offer payouts to webmasters in cryptocurrencies to lower fees and simplify the process. ADAPlus will make the payout process convenient and straightforward. This can induce additional popularity and adoption of Cardano into the affiliate marketing business as transaction fees are much lower than making payouts in BTC or ETH. In addition, packing many payments into a single transaction saves businesses money.\n\nSuppose the contextual advertising network has thousands of partners who want to receive payments in Cardano with existing wallets. In that case, this becomes an almost impossible task that requires colossal, time-consuming, and monotonous actions. The system will make it possible to make such payments in one click, saving more than 10x on fees.\n\nInvestment funds and others\n\nMany businesses need to make mass payments regularly. A list of recipients or amounts may differ every time. By exporting lists to a simple CSV format and importing it to ADAPlus, the process is simplified as the system immediately analyzes their audience.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nStage 0 - Proof of Concept (up to 2 months of development)\n\nWe will release a website that SPOs can use to send rewards to delegators based on different parameters. We want to deliver a working proof of concept before Fund 6 ends. For intense testing from our developers and everyone from the community, we will provide three independent versions that will work with the Cardano mainnet, testnet, and a guild network.

A hash value of digital data, such as a file, can be included in a transaction. Since the data cannot be changed once on the blockchain, nothing can be added retrospectively, and this hash value cannot be faked. This means that a message with a hash value is proof that your data existed when the message was sent. The blockchain acts as a cryptographic notary who is impartial and inflexible. The algorithm for obtaining a hash sum is a one-way function. You cannot get back the contents of your data from it, and you do not disclose the contents of the data to it.\n\nLevel 2 (rolled-out):\n\nI went much further and developed the idea of \"Proof of Existence\" with several new layers. Utilizing cryptography capabilities, you can now anonymously sign your Proof of Existence and, if necessary, prove in court that the data is yours, you are the owner of the private key, and the author of the signed message.\n\nLevel 3 (rolled-out):\n\nBut this is just the beginning. Using these same solid cryptographic techniques, you can encrypt your data and store it on the public internet. Only you, as the private key owner, can decrypt the data or get a long and complex password to decrypt it. In case of data loss, you have the option to recover the data. Since each file is encrypted with its own secure password, you can share the password from a specific file. Working with keys, encrypting and decrypting data takes place exclusively on your side, in your browser. The keys and the content of the original data are never transmitted to the server. All used encryption and hashing algorithms are reliable and safe to use. Whether you are a book author, musician, photographer, artist, designer, or even a business working with important documents, CardanoWall can help you create concrete proof of your work.\n\nA new feature allows the creation of PoE for any internet page. CardanoWall creates a full-size screenshot + WARC file containing all internal and external elements like images, CSS styles, JS scripts, etc. CardanoWall takes care of the technical part and loads all files in the client's browser to create a PoE record with an additional option to include encrypted versions to CW storage. This feature helps proving the usage of copyrighted materials without permission. It is in demand among lawyers for the protection of intellectual property rights. People can also monitor and save fake news on the internet or store a copy of new official information posted on government websites.\n\nLevel4 (in progress):\n\nCurrently, I am working on additional features with a clear vision about the next fourth level of PoE that will enable secure and encrypted communication on the Cardano blockchain between parties or additional applications. It will bring more real-life usage and attract businesses to use CW for providing bonus materials tied to a purchased product with an included private key.\n\nFunding\n\nAt the moment, I am doing all the back-end/front-end/marketing work myself. Additional funding will allow me to allocate more time to the CardanoWall project, hire a JS developer to improve in-browser encryption of large files, hire advisors to fulfill criteria from courts and legal structures of different countries. It can also cover some costs for CardanoWall public storage/redundancy + additional external servers used for creating screenshot/warc files described in the update above.\n\nBack-end: me, an additional senior JS developer, Cryptography/Cybersecurity specialist, independent security audit for BE and FE: 35000 USD\nFront-end: UX/UI improvements as new features appear, redesign: 2500 USD\nInfrastructure for 1 year (prod/dev/api servers, storage servers, crawlers for page PoE): 3000 USD\nMarketing: additional professional materials to onboard businesses, such as an explainer video I created. Online ads and social networks promotions: 17000 USD\n\nThe amount I am asking may seem high, but it's definitely not enough. That's why I also fund the project from the entire profit of my VICE stake pool that is producing blocks because of a high pledge I invested in it. By supporting my pool you support the further development of CardanoWall.\n\nhttps://vicepool.com/\n\nMentoring\n\nI would be happy to receive support and help from IOHK experts in the form of mentoring in cryptography, which takes a large and important part of the CardanoWall project.\n\nAdditional usage\n\nCardanoWall offers much more than I could describe in a short problem statement/solution. You can effortlessly send messages to the Cardano blockchain network without needing to understand the technical goings-on behind the scenes. Your message will become part of the blockchain and will remain there forever. You can also include other types of information other than text, such as an image or geo-position, along with the text message. So it's a Twitter/Instagram built on a blockchain. Some artists already started using CardanoWall as an NFT platform to pass a private key that can decrypt the original artwork. Many new possibilities appear as the project develops with new features.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nQ3 2021: Public API for automatic creation of PoE records without the usage of CardanoWall website.\n\nQ4 2021: An option to use individual wallets/addresses for businesses. Additional features for business accounts.\n\nQ4 2021: Level 4 features for secure encrypted communication and transferring access to CW storage encrypted files.\n\nQ3 2021 - Q1 2022: Building custom solutions for businesses and onboarding more companies for PoE usage on the Cardano blockchain.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366814-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n!*************See attached PDF For Tunheim Info and event planning specifics*************!\n\n \n\n \n\nCardano Creative Commons (CCC) is seeking funding to explore the creation of a global, value-flow loyalty rewards methodology which formalizes stake pool delegator reward distribution to those who have contributed to systemic value-flow via a purpose driven stake pool, specifically the CCC stake pool. Simply put, think of a lawnmower with a pull-cord attached to a flywheel. It takes a significant amount of energy to start the lawnmower for the mower to run continuously. Delegators in this analogy provide flywheel source energy (FSE) to start the value-flow machine / torus / \"Accelerator Portal\".\n\nSmart contract, incentivized stake pool delegation will play a key role in developing and deploying self-sustaining Developer Ecosystem. The intent is to transition from external incentivization to a closed loop system which will grow as the Developer Ecosystem matures while rewarding loyal community members weighted by first consecutive ADA delegation epoch to current date, current delegation/epoch and total amount of CCC native asset staked on CCC stake pool.\n\nNot only will this project breathe life into Cardano Creative Commons which has the potential to become a global Decentralized Autonomous Organization with regional \"Accelerator Portals,\" funding this project directly feeds SPOCRA's ability to serve new and existing stake pool operators by providing a model and opportunities for stake pool(s) as a service (SPaaS).\n\nToroidal value-flow is self-sustaining:\n\n• Delegators are incentivized by loyalty rewards and directly supporting pools funding the Developer Ecosystem Accelerator Portal.\n\n• Creative developer & entrepreneurial talent outside of the Cardano ecosystem is attracted in by opportunities allowing them to focus on business value they can generate.\n\nThe cornerstone of kickstarting the toroidal value-flow is the creation of a development accelerator stake pool operation and a delegator loyalty rewards program using a custom native token and smart contracts.\n\nCCC stake pools will be established as purpose driven stake pools in support of the CCC mission. Delegator rewards will provide the primary FSE which may be signed securely via stake pool owner held private stake pool keys.\n\nThe funds requested will in part finance the startup & operation costs and compensation to the designated stake pool operator for the running of the CCC stake pool(s).\n\nProject: Step by Step\n\n1. Setup of a high security enterprise level i.e., following all SPOCRA standards, stake pool operation whereby the owner and the operator have established a best practice method for key management.\n\n2. A CCC enterprise level stake pool operation with proper monitoring and maintenance practices being followed to ensure consistent block production will be established.

Use the designs to secure an MOU with Cardano Ecosystem \"ADA Influencers\" to construct a highly incentivized tokenomics plan, including the creation of x number of additional stake pools and integration of smart contract guaranteeing delegation for years option in exchange for highest ADA loyalty rewards based off of revenue from the Accelerator Portal Ride, \"Gift/Gratitude\" smart contract value-flow code inserted into Cardano Multiversity Members' smart contracts and the smart contracts of CCC Incubators. CCC delegators will effectively be able to enjoy value-flow from the projects of all Life-Long Multiversity Members and CCC incubated projects including but not limited to distributed finance, insurance, healthcare, food production and distribution, education, real estate, government automation etc.\n\nTo achieve this accelerated objective, Cardano Creative Commons has developed a strategy to leverage a 40 million in person visitors per year traffic stream to Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota by first designing a phenomenally functional:\n\n• Onboard\n\n• Educate\n\n• Incubate\n\nWork, Live, Play Accelerator Portal Complex\n\nCardano Creative Commons (CCC) @ Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota U.S. would become a multi-story Work, Live, Play complex connected by skyway to a $300M water park (already separately, fully funded and approved; breaking ground spring 2022). The Mall of America, including the water park is the largest mall in North America. Currently, MOA receives over 40 million visitors per year not counting an additional estimated 800,000 visitors per year to the water park.\n\n \n\n*************BIGGEST TAKEAWAY***************\n\nThe \"GUARANTEED DELEGATION FOR YEARS\" SMART CONTRACT will create enormous project confidence among tag-along smart contract bound stake pool delegators at the highest loyalty rewards as well as confidence created by standard delegators with opportunity-risk-matched loyalty rewards as the project will be virtually GUARANTEED 100% ADA REWARDS FOR YEARS FOR CCC!!! This guaranteed rewards flow will be collateralized for short term financing to build project and generate immediate cash flow upon completion via the \"Cardano Accelerator Portal\" ride, apartment rent and long term smart contract value-flow from Multiversity Alumni and incubation projects from sample projects listed above and others.\n\n**********************************************\n\n                            Cardano Creative Commons (CCC) Comprehensive Facility Walk-Through\n\nOnboard: \"Cardano Accelerator Portal\" ride\n\nLet's start with the facility as a whole and then work our way up from the ground floor, while moving from physical-local to virtual-global. First, lets create a common orientation. Checkout the aerial photo of the water park and the adjacent parking facility connected via a skyway on the left of the main proposal photo. The skyway would be the approach to the top of an escalator leading directly to the \"Cardano Accelerator Portal\" (CAP) ride where the water park parking illustration is on the left-hand side of the photo. As the MOA visitors walk through the skyway towards the CAP they will be visually engaged via a video playing within the CAP lobby but visible from the frame of the skyway \"tunnel-vision\" with a gradual reveal of a larger screen as the visitor approaches. The top of the escalator is the \"event horizon\" drawing the visitor into the Cardano \"Accelerator Portal\" onboarding experience. As the visitor descends, more is revealed encouraging the visitor to become a curious explorer of possibilities with visual previews of what to expect. The story begins even before tickets are purchased.\n\nThe estimated maximum throughput per hour as currently anticipated according to ride designer Cavu is 1,280 riders/hour maximum capacity at roughly $20/rider with a fraction of the riders choosing the post show \"Multiversity Portal\" experience.\n\n(See and VOTE  for: \"CCC:PRISM RIDE @MOA; 40M Visits/yr\" https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CCC-PRISM-RIDE-@MOA-40M-Visits-yr/366834-48088 )\n\nOnce tickets purchased, there are three principal components:\n\n• Pre-Show\n\no Pre-show sets the stage regarding the adventure, establishing the \"why\", the quest and the anticipated reward. Riders will be prompted to download Atala PRISM to complete the ride experience. They will be entertained and engaged as they are invited to tap into the wealth creating possibilities of building a credentials portfolio and using it to unlock new opportunities.\n\n• Show\n\no The actual ride will be a state-of-the-art virtual reality, motion-based ride with custom accelerator portal vehicles which will enable participants to leap dimensions and \"experience\" Cardano while gathering the credentials they need to ascend to the Cardano Multiversity. Upon completion of the ride experience, the riders will have earned a credentials badge which they will add to their Atala PRISM credentials portfolio indicating they are \"Cardano Multiversity: Leap Ready\".\n\n• Post Show\n\no The ACTUAL LEAP\n\no The QRCode for the badge they stored within their credentials wallet will allow them to access the literal Multiversity Portal within the post show transporter room with their first name appearing above their leap station.\n\no There will be a flurry of activity prompting those who have their \"Leap Ready\" badge to \"Stand-By To Leap!\"\n\no \"Lock Leapers!\"\n\no Via special visual and audio effects, it will appear the rider disappeared while they were actually raised to the 2nd floor Cardano Multiversity by an invisible \"deus ex machina\" / robotic arm.\n\no Those who have taken the leap of faith may watch a looped informational video presentation in a theatre setting with an in-depth description of what Cardano Multiversity has to offer in-person and online including the Cardano Multiversity Experience, Value-Flow Entrepreneurialism/Wealth Stream Creation and how to join the work, Live, Play community at Cardano Creative Commons, Mall of America.\n\n(The actual flow of the show and determining factors of who leaps {self-selected? some or all?} to \"Cardano Multiversity\" and who doesn't is to be determined.)\n\nNote: A separate Work, Live, Play residential visitors lobby would be on the north-east corner of the building entering from 24th Ave S. Also included in residential amenities would be a health club, yoga studio, float spa and sauna as well as a larger general community room and sky club room on the top floor with views of jets taking off from MSP just a few blocks away.\n\nHidden from public view, underground with controlled access will be a physically, electrically, hydrostatically, hydraulically and magnetically hardened state of the art network operating center \"Cardano Cloud\" \"disaster proof\" hosting facility completely dedicated to supporting onboard, educate, incubate accelerated value-flow Cardano ecosystem. Network Operators could live onsite in the residential portion of the building, with 24/7/365 onsite support.\n\nEducate: Cardano Multiversity\n\n(See and VOTE  for: \"CCC: Cardano Multiversity MVP\" https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CCC-Cardano-Multiversity-MVP/366734-48088 )\n\n2nd Floor: Cardano Multiversity will be the physical manifestation of the virtual education opportunities available to every connected human on the planet. It will also house state of the art in person, synchronous and asynchronous distance learning hybrid spaces, live streaming and content creation \"co-labs\" including social media synchronized and automated multiplatform simulcasting. The local community and traveling learners will have access to Cardano Education Professionals who are committed to accelerated onboarding, education and facilitating incubation and connecting those with skills to those who need skilled Cardano Professionals for their projects.\n\nIncubate: Globally Connected Coworking\n\n(See and VOTE  for: \"CCC: Reset Ready?|Value-Flow Wealth\" https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CCC-Reset-Ready-Value-Flow-Wealth/366817-48088 Onboard, Educate and Incubate Businesses )\n\n3rd Floor: Incubator will be the most forward-thinking coworking spaces available just blocks south of the Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). The acceleration objective will be met by introducing newly Cardano certified professionals with those who are actively incubating projects. The freedom and sovereignty of individuals will be enhanced by offering maximum flexibility to create one's own work-life balance by working how when and where an individual wants without having to travel to work for those who reside at Work|Live|Play @ Cardano Creative Commons, Mall of America.\n\n4th Floor and up. Depending upon financing, we could build as high as 94 ft or what the FAA or airport commission will allow. Living connected to Mall of America and the water park provides a climate-controlled space to stretch your legs, shop, dine, play and just decompress. Every day for 2 hours before stores are open in MOA, the mall is wide open and very peaceful for morning walkers to get their steps in surrounded by trees, pools, fountains and massive amounts of natural light via skylights. Anyone who is actively engaged with the Cardano ecosystem will be able to engage and disengage at will, take a nap, workout, swim, livestream, study, collaborate whenever and wherever they please and for as long as they wish, taking breaks when they want/need to.\n\nFinancing\n\nCardano Creative Commons cash-flow strategy is very unique and is based completely upon a conceptual incentivized accelerated stake pool saturation \"Giving-Gratitude\" smart contract loyalty rewards program. With our strategy there would be no need to offer equity and any debt could be retired relatively quickly due to our mix of incentivized \"Guaranteed Delegation For Term/Years\" option.\n\nExample: Let's say \"ADA Influencers\" opted to delegate 10M ADA to 10 stake pools for 5 years via a \"Gift/Gratitude\" smart contract in exchange for a loyalty rewards token which will ultimately be used to calculate loyalty rewards to be paid in ADA based on the revenue generated from ride sales and smart contract income from Multiversity Community Member Members and incubated projects. The guaranteed delegator commitment would attract other delegators whose loyalty rewards would be reflected by their loyalty as measured by their commitment to the Cardano Creative Commons project and for how long. If \"ADA Influencers\" stepped forward, the CCC facility could be designed and proposed to the City of Bloomington for inclusion in the 2022 ground breaking of the water park across the street AND CCC would be eligible for a $5 million TIF flexibility grant. The 10M ADA guaranteed delegation per stake pool would build ethos among potential interested delegators and would build momentum for increased and ongoing support for the CCC project. The city would have a globally connected school and a showcase facility to win over the global site selection committee for the 2027 World Expo. Bloomington finished in the top 3 sites worldwide for the 2023 World Expo.\n\nKey Performance Indicators:\n\nDesigner created common reference designs to contribute to facility scope, time-frame and financing dialogue\n\nKey construction stakeholders engaged\n\nDates set to meet with City of Bloomington for approval and potential $5 million TIF financing cash contribution to project\n\nIOG and Cardano Foundation engaged to transform from concept to reality","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366871-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nIn India, cases of fake degrees and forged certificates have been rising rapidly in recent years. When that is coupled with increasing unemployment rates, it results in a significant number of candidates applying for every single job position available on the market.\n\nThis means for recruiters it becomes an uphill battle to verify the credibility of each applicant's credentials reliably.\n\nWe are thus proposing a solution to use the metadata feature of Cardano Blockchain to create a platform that helps Universities, Ed-tech platforms, Recruiters, and degree holders alike to authorize, validate and securely store their certificate records in an easily accessible manner.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDetailed Problem Statement:\n\nIn India and many other developing countries, The process of checking these degree certificates generates a lot of documentation, and storing them digitally necessitates a central authority in charge of managing the records, which opens the door to tampering and data loss. Some academic institutions make it simple and quick to check the validity of their qualifications online, without even asking who needs the information. Others assign the responsibility to third parties (by design or regulation), while others market the service. Finally, there are times when there is no other option but to contact the academic secretary's office at the educational institution to validate the legitimacy of a credential or qualification. Academic degree fraud, on the other hand, is a reality that arises with the involvement of authorities and institutional employees.\n\nIndia, as a populous country with a large youth population and a gateway to numerous educational opportunities, lacks a consistent, stable, reliable, and tamper-proof method of verifying credentials. This is a significant disadvantage since there are a large number of fraud cases, which slows down the growth of our education sector and job markets. The existing tools available are insufficiently safe to keep fraud to a bare minimum. They, sadly, have numerous flaws and, on top of that, are ineffective in terms of cost.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat we're trying to achieve. (Project Description)\n\nTo develop a decentralized application on the top of Cardano's blockchain to combat this serious problem.\nSince blockchain technology is resistant to data manipulation, it makes the validation of academic qualifications tamper-proof.\nThe date (Timestamp) from which a piece of data is recorded cannot be changed and is publicly verifiable which is very crucial to verify the date on which a particular degree is being issued to a student.\nThere's no need for a central authority.\nWe will also be deploying smart contracts for special use cases such as degree revocation.\n\nThe use of Metadata:\n\nClient (Universities) will upload the content metadata from the digital degree and our platform will encode the metadata and assign it a unique key for each student.\nThe metadata will then be attached to the transaction as Cardano gives us the ability to add metadata to blockchain transactions and the encoded information will be stamped onto Cardano's blockchain.\nEach transaction will use our private native token which will help us with traceability and accountability.\nThe stamped information will be easily verifiable with our Deqree platform.\n\nWe also are working on our prototype that is featured in the given demo. We are adding new functionality everyday and refining our UI/UX. We are welcome to any feedback or suggestions regarding the prototype and also do contact us if you would like to test our product independently. We are also contacting different universities to test our prototype.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Guiding questions\n\nWhy does the target audience care about the solution?\nOur solution makes the process of authorizing and validating certificates an easy-to-use and straightforward process.\n\n \n\nDoes the solution need hardware components?\nThe user can access our services via a smartphone or PC.\n\n \n\nHow does this create value for Cardano?\nOur project has the potential to bring in thousands of new users to the Cardano Ecosystem as India's higher education market is estimated to be over 37 million students and currently facing this serious issue.\n\n \n\n \n\nSeveral other such questions have been addressed in the attached white paper.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQs\n\n1. As the Indian government has a National Academic Depository, will you need to change the whole system at the government level?\n\nA. No, as Deqree can act along with the conventional government system. There is no restriction to that. Also, NAD requires the candidate to provide a set of private information to the verifier and also needs to be pre-registered for that service to work. On top of that, the NAD is slow, time-taking and costly for the end-user while our system is quick and completely free for the end-users.\n\n2. Is your product only restricted to universities?\n\nA. No, as we are also looking forward to bringing Ed-Tech platforms onboard for issuing their online course-based certificates through Deqree.\n\n3. How will you convince any universities to come on board?\nA. We have applied to several universities' Incubation cells. We are currently in talks with India's top technical institute and have received positive feedback from them. We are also initially focusing on Ed-tech startups and we will work with them to gain customer feedback, refine our product and improve our services.\n\n4. Do you store private customer data?\nA. No, our platform doesn't store anything but generates a unique hash for each certificate and then stamps it via transaction metadata.

Tokenized properties will be bought and sold via smart contracts drastically reducing transaction costs and timelines. \n\nThe first version of the marketplace (what we are requesting funding for) will be geared toward real estate investments, our flip tokens. Through the network we will be able to crowdsource the funding needed to renovate the tokenized property via our partnership with a qualified contracting team. This first iteration of the network will be easiest to implement because there are far less bridges to cross. The property ownership never actually transfers to the investors, no lending is involved, and the typical ADA wallet will suffice - the features planned for our network user wallet in the long term are not required for this. This initial functionality will simplify real estate investing, open real estate investing to investors with minimal capital/experience & reduce fees/responsibilities. We will establish a solid base of users by providing a simplified way to invest in profitable real estate projects, while introducing the idea of buying real estate with ADA. While the network operates as an investing platform, our development team will be working on the integration and implementation of the functionalities required to actually buy and sell (transfer legitimate ownership) tokenized properties on the platform. \n\nAs our number of partnerships increase, adoption and development will continue to grow. We will then deploy the later versions of the marketplace, wallet, and property token that will allow for smart contract home purchases and sales on The Network. At that point we will have 5-7 well trained real estate agents working within successful brokerages across at least 7 states, generating buyers, sellers, investors, and properties to continue populating the network.\n\n \n\nREQUESTED FUNDING: $40,100\n\n**LAUNCH DATE:**01JAN2022\n\nHow funding will be used:\n\nDevelopment Cost: $20,000 (Development up-to Flip Token functionality for 10-25 users)\n\nStage 2 DEV Cost: $8,000\n\nCreate user profile and user acceptance checkpoint\n\nIntegrate verification tool\n\nIntegrate database - personal setting storage for each profile\n\nUpdating Marketplace UI\n\nWallet V1 DEV Cost: $8,000\n\nDapp connector R & D + Integration\n\nBuilding Wallet UI\n\nUpdating Marketplace UI\n\nWallet/Marketplace Functionality Cost: $4,000\n\nWallet/Marketplace connectivity R & D\n\nIntegration repairs\n\nMarketing Cost : $11,700\n\nFull time pay for head of marketing: $7,200 (1,200/mo)\n\nContent creation: $1,500 (3 platforms, 3 post per day)\n\nSocial media ad campaigns: $3,000 ($1000/mo for ads)\n\nGrowth/Adoption Plan Cost:  $8,300\n\nGoal is to establish at least 1 partnership in 7 total states (2 states currently established MA & VA) by 01JAN22 Launch date.\n\nSchedule meetings with 15 brokerages to pitch and acquire AT LEAST 1 partnership in each state.

Opposed to the current MLS structure where only real estate agents have access, The Chosen Homes Network is open to everyone that creates an account and verifies their identity. Along with gaining access to the marketplace, creating an account also creates a digital wallet for that user. This wallet securely stores a user's funds, equity and properties all in one place. This wallet allows users to send funds to buy a property and invest in flips, as well as receive funds for selling or receive their profits from a flip they've invested in. This will drastically reduce real estate transaction fees, saving both the buyer and seller money on every transaction. Transitioning real estate transactions to the blockchain will not only increase speed and efficiency but every property added to the network has its transfer and lien history coded into it, which is then automatically updated upon every future transfer. This establishes a new standard for accuracy and transparency of property ownership documentation. The fuel to the engine that is The Chosen Homes Network is its ADA staking pool. The ADA staked in the pool provides a consistent flow of currency that will allow The Chosen Homes Network treasury to back the value of the tokenized properties allowing for the instantaneous transfers. The treasury is able to act as the required party in any transaction, being the immediate buyer of a property being sold and providing a marketplace of available properties for users to purchase. This treasury/pool also allows us to completely restructure the lending side of homeownership by selling tokenized properties via smart contracts coded with terms of monthly repayment to the pool, radically reducing the financial obligation of homeownership and interest paid to own a home. This lending restructure routes the money that would otherwise be bank and mortgage lender profit. Instead each monthly payment is disbursed to the homeowner themselves, as they hold their equity in their Network User wallet, and to the treasury/pool that also provides consistent long term rewards to its delegators and uses 100% of its margin for charity.\n\n \n\nTeam is not showing up for me so I am adding their emails/usernames below:\n\nCo-submitters: Trevor@chosenhomes.net , Nate@chosenhomes.net , @christobear (DEV)","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366896-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nSummary\n\nhttps://www.cornucopias.io\n\nCornucopias 'The Island' is a blockchain based play-to-earn, build-to-earn, and learn-to-earn, stake-to-earn MMORPG game where players can own land and other NFT (non-fungible tokens) based assets that have real-world value, all hosted in a fun and expanding metaverse (a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users). It was inspired from Charles Hoskinson's video - \"The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\".\n\n 'The Island' is split into a number of themed zones such as the 'Wild⋆West' zone, 'Farm Life' zone and 'Age of The Samurai' zone, where people of all ages can play a series of mini-games, getting lost in the play-to-earn ecosystem where they can earn real-world value as they explore and build in our safe and secure world.\n\nThe more creative players can design their own items such as coffee tables, beds and other household furnishings which can then be minted into an 'Island Blueprint' that other players can then buy, gather the materials, and then craft in-game into a brand new NFT. Once created, the crafter can play with the items in their virtual dwelling or sell them onto other players to enjoy or sell on again.\n\n'The Island' combines gaming with real-world commerce and gives opportunities for traditional and ecommerce companies to sell and promote their real-world brands, goods and services, to a hard to reach audience they have potentially never had access to before.\n\nAvailable worldwide, 'The Island' is built on the Unreal Engine 5 games engine which is compatible with the PC, mobile phone, games consoles and smart TV's, and will be powered, governed and be forever evolving thanks to a growing number of communities including blockchain, Unreal game developers, Voxel, 3D artists and modelers and general game enthusiasts.\n\nCreators and players will discover a new form of currency economics where they can create and trade their own NFT's in-game or on 3rd party marketplaces, and no longer will their purchased game assets be trapped inside a single game again.\n\nA disruptive gaming revolution is upon us and Cornucopias 'The Island' awaits everyone to come and join in the fun of changing gaming forever!\n\nCardano Background\n\nAs a member of the Original 50 Cardano Project Catalyst I have been active in the community and have been working on the Cardano network for over a year - I have successfully delivered a project in Fund 3 https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Smart-Contract-Plugin/333827-48088 and I am working on a project for Fund 4.\n\nKnowing the eco-system and community so well I formed a new company in January 2021 dedicated to writing a blockchain game on Cardano. Self-funded with 4 other Cardano pioneers to date we have been busy planning the game, building the team and putting together the Whitepaper and a series of demos to show the community how the game may work.\n\nCornucopias 'The Island' Game could not have been possible without Project Catalyst introducing me to Cardano however to date it has all been bootstrapped and has had no Catalyst funding.\n\nI want to continue to build Open Source software for the community to use alongside building the game, and if this project is successfully funded I will produce the following using members of the Plutus Pioneer courses to both help my project and to help others in the community to put their new skills to work.\n\n'The Island' is powered by NFT's as players build upon and own the land, characters items and real estate. The game will allow community members to own their own NFT shop and allow them to sell their NFT's.\n\nI therefore need Smart Contracts to help many transactions occur.\n\nThe first open source project I need Smart Contracts for is an NFT Auction House. This will be a key feature to help community members to auction their NFT's and in addition to the software will be usable away from The Island to help others grow their own software companies.\n\nWhy gaming on Cardano?\n\nThere are so many reasons to build an NFT game on Cardano, don't look at the network in August 2021 look where it will be in August 2022. We will have:\n\n- lots of DeFi applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.\n\n- lots of NFT applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.\n\n- lots of Plutus developers we can offer full time jobs.\n\n- Atala Prism will allow us to verify players age which is really important to parts of the game and something no other Blockchain can offer.\n\n- Hydra will offer 1 million transactions per second.\n\n- scalability and reliability is critical for a game that is aiming to attract 1m+ players.\n\n \n\nWhat does success look like?\n\nSuccess will be judged on the games popularity and to date we are growing a very good reputation on social media and a lot of positive 'buzz' is happening around the game.\n\nWe are looking at bringing over 1 million gamers to the Cardano Network within the first 3 years of launch and are looking to recruit many people from inside the Cardano community.\n\nThe Play-to-Earn and Build-To-Earn features of the game will bring prosperity to gamers like never before and has the chance to change lives in many countries.\n\nWe have recently teamed up with an Education Centre that holds virtual lessons in Africa and the Learn-To-Earn aspect of the game will help that eco-system grow further.\n\nStake-To-Earn aims to simplify staking and yield farming using a gamification style interface.\n\nSuccess will also come in the form of recognition that Cardano is an amazing platform to build NFT Gaming on.\n\nWhat does the current team look like?\n\nI have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I started building the game alongside my full-time job in January and in July I went full-time working on the game - a huge leap of faith as I have no means of making an income until the game launches.

People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire (centralized) tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do (in fiat). (see \"Illustration 1). However, its a centralized tool where Profila as commercial company needs to guarantee what data was shared, and where payouts in fiat take time, have large transaction fees, and are only done 1x/month in bulk. \n\nBig picture explanation of the current proposal. Building further on the existing data sharing functionalities in the Profila App (step 2 above), we will develop a proof-of-concept smart contract system that saves all relevant information you as an individual shared with a company onto the Cardano blockchain (in encrypted form), in exchange for instant payment in ADA. If a company (mis)uses your info in breach of this (smart) contract, you will be able to use your private key to access this info yourself (without Profila's involvement), and hold a brand accountable for breaching the agreement. This way you control the narrative, you control the relationship with a brand, and their use of your data. \n\nSuccess after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be the developed POC for this smart contract. Success after 6 months would be the integration of this smart contract POC into our existing app and first test with our existing customer. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of the POC, used for each data subscription. \n\n***********************************************************************************************************************\n\nNow let's move on to our actual (detailed) proposal (!):\n\n1. The market explained - the current privacy problem\n\nPeople interact with digital services and purchase products from Brands globally. With each interaction you directly share personal data which is used for a certain purpose (e.g. offering you a product and servicing you as a customer). You agree to share your personal data – in most cases – without knowing how a Brand will use it.\n\nIn principle, each time your personal data is collected or used by a brand, you are shown a privacy policy or cookie policy you are forced to accept. Thereby, you agree to share your personal data, without knowing how recipients will use it. These legal documents are impossible to understand.\n\nBut what can you do if Brands uses your data against your expectations, and how do you keep track of all these legal terms that governs Brands' use of your personal data?\n\nFor example: you made an online Wholefoods-account to order groceries but you now get 15 newsletters/week, and your social media feed is full of adds from companies like Trader Joe's, to who you never shared your personal data. You have no idea what you agreed to in a privacy policy with Wholefoods, and you do not know why similar companies are contacting you for products you bought from Wholefoods.\n\nToday, you have no control over the use of your personal data. It is entirely the Brand that decides (i) when to contact you (+frequency), (ii) via which channel, and (iii) the content you receive. However, people demand more control over their personal data and are willing to take action to gain back ownership of their digital lives, but the resources to put that in motion are lacking.\n\nThat is where Profila steps in!\n\n2. Profila today - the existing consumer App – first step towards data control and compensation\n\n\"We must work together with web companies to strike a balance that puts a fair level of data control back in the hands of people, including the development of new technology … and exploring alternative revenue models like subscriptions and micropayments\" (Tim Berners-Lee, developer of the worldwide web @ CERN).\n\nIf you know how to control your data and take action against those who (mis)use it, you can demand the value that is derived from it by asking compensation.\n\nAn important step in order to get to data control, is keeping track of your personal data and who has access to it. This is taken care of by Profila's data subscriptions. Profila's data subscription contract functionality allows for people to keep track of all the Brands that access and collect your personal data; and ultimately receive a compensation from Brands that subscribe to your data.\n\nVia Profila's web-based Brand dashboard, a Brand can send a \"subscription offer\" to their existing customers or potential new customers, in which the Brand can detail which of your personal information in your Profila App (one source of truth with your contact details, communication-, product preferences) they ask access to, and in which they propose to you some key contractual terms in relation to your interaction; a.o. (1) the specific data they require, (2) the duration you grant access; (3) the purpose for which the Brand wants to use it; and (4) the compensation you receive in exchange.\n\nOur process makes sure the Brand explains the contract terms in understandable language, so the consumer knows what he/she agrees to. Our revenue model is 50/50, meaning that every USD that a Brand pays for accessing your personal data (and showing you its products/services), we share 50/50 with consumers.(Please see the illustrations 2 \"Smart contract visual\" and 3 \"Subscription payment visual\").\n\nIf you do not agree to these terms, you remain anonymous and the Brand will never see your personal data. If you do agree to these terms, you essentially click \"accept\" and both parties conclude a data subscription contract. Payment is made by the brand at intervals throughout the contract terms (usually monthly), on the conditions that the consumers' personal data is kept up to data, and the brand can also access additional data about the consumer's preferences for certain products and services relevant for the brand.\n\nE.g. Wholefoods pays Alice 12 USD/year (1 USD each month) to access her (i) personal data (email, phone) (ii) preferences about food (vegetarian, bio-products, lactose intolerant) and (iii) communication preferences (Alice would like to receive discounts/product info via WhatsApp). This helps to serve her better. If Wholefoods listens to Alice, she will be a happy consumer. Alice gets good products and services and receives a compensation for the use of her personal data by Wholefoods. Each advertisement she watches from the Brand in Profila, Alice gets paid. If Alice wants to know in the future what she agreed to, she can easily verify the terms of her relationship with Wholefoods in her Profila App (under the Wholefoods data subscription). If Alice want's the relationship to stop, she can end the contract and exercise her \"right to be forgotten\" (via the privacy rights functionality in the Profila App, see our metadata challenge submission in the first sentence of this proposal), so that Wholefoods is legally required to delete her personal data.\n\nConclusion: these subscriptions help brands with their privacy compliance + get to know you better; and these subscriptions help you control your data, get compensation, and receive only those messages from brands you care about, via the channel of your choice.\n\n3. Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - implementing data subscription contracts on the Cardano blockchain in the form of a smart contract, and using ADA for micropayments\n\nWhat do we seek to improve via this Challenge?\n\nIssue 1 - \"centralized contract management\" – each data subscription contract (including the specific terms) that is concluded between an individual Profila user and a Brand today, is only saved/stored by Profila in our IT environment and can only be enforced by Profila or its existence proven by Profila. Profila as a commercial entity is therefore guaranteeing that a data subscription exists, what terms it contains, whether terms are abided by (e.g. payments made or request received).\n\nProfila needs to monitor if money is paid by the Brand, and if personal data and other commercial data by the individuals is filled in/updated. This is a liability for both contracting parties, who would need to trust Profila.\n\nProfila, as a commercial company, would have to actively step in as arbitrator/mediator, and guarantee this level of trust that a transaction took place/contract was concluded + terms thereof. However, we only want to provide consumers with the tools to control their data. The trust and consensus that a transaction took place or contract was made needs to come from the community of users.\n\nIssue 2 - \"low-value; high volume payments\" - The data license fee and any other fees for attention to be paid to users are currently setup using Stripe, which is not ideal for sending very low-amount, high-volume instant payments worldwide. \n\nWhat is Mitsubishi, as a Japanese brand, needs to pay a US consumer on Profila for a data subscription (let's assume 2.4 EUR per company per year, paid on a monthly basis)? We would have to bill Mitsubishi 0.20 USD for the monthly subscription and transfer our US customer 0,10 USD (50% of the revenue). This takes time, administration, and will include large payment processing fees (compared to the amount transferred). Considering the number of customers of the Profila App (25.000 expected in 2021; 78.200 expected in 2022), payout models like Stripe are too expensive and do not scale. We have setup monthly payouts to consumers (in bulk, for several activities with several brands combined) to reduce costs of transferring money, but we would want to be able to instantly pay a consumer without many transaction fees.\n\nWhat do we seek to create in the POC under this Challenge?\n\nUnder the Catalyst project fund 6, we want to tackle these 2 issues by including smart contracts (which executes themselves and don't require Profila as intermediary monitoring entity) and paying the compensation out via ADA.\n\nFirst, we will include the relevant elements of a data subscription in an immutable (Cardano) blockchain ledger. The POC will show on the ledger all contracts you concluded with different Brands, showing every authorization or consent you gave to each company for the use of your (personal) data.\n\nNobody would be able to tamper with this information. If a company misuses your data, you can make them accountable by referring to the ledger entry. You can even use the information in the blockchain to file a complaint at a national data protection authority, showing them what you agreed to, and how the company actually (mis)used your data. This is control.\n\nIMPORTANT - We do not put the actual personal data on a public ledger, but only an identifier of each participant (hashed/deidentified) and the actual terms of the contract (e.g. Parties= YT132 and ZW345; Shared information= email; Period= 3 months; Payment= 1EUR etc). This entry provides proof the \"EVENT OCCURED\" but doesn't show the actual people involved nor personal data shared. When either of these 2 parties wants to proof this in the future, they have the underlying information (private keys / certificates) to show the actual data that was exchanged. If third parties need access (e.g. privacy authority or courts), then the ledger provides proof of the event, and the parties can then share the actual documents that were exchanged. The public blockchain however will never hold the personal data.\n\nSecond, we want to integrate cryptocurrency payments using ADA, so that people can receive instant micropayments for their personal data and attention if the terms of the smart contract remain fulfilled.\n\nWhat other challenges are ahead in our \"Zero-knowledge advertising & insights\" development roadmap?\n\nThis smart-contract project is only the first step into our broader Cardano technology adoption and integration around zero-knowledge advertising and insights, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. Under the next funds, we want to submit additional project proposals for important features we want to develop as part of this effort:\n\n- step 1 - personal data license smart contract - this is part of the present submission.\n\n- step 2 - privacy ledger – This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform. UPDATE - We have submitted this proposal under the \"metadata challenge\" of FUND 5 and received the first place! #thankyouADAcommunity. See here for our proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088. We will keep you posted on our progress.\n\n- Step 3 - digital ID (for FUND 6) - Atala implementation – If you want to control your data online and receive (financial) compensation for your data, it is important you can provide proof of your identity. Atala Prism is the perfect solution. By integrating Atala, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments. We are sending in a submission in FUND 6 challenge \"Atala PRISM DID Mass-Scale Adoption\", https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26116\n\n- step 4 (for FUND 7 or later) - zero-knowledge proofs - personalized ads with respect of privacy - using zero-knowledge proofs in order to allow a brand to advertise to the \"perfect\" consumer (meaning to the exact target audience consumer, which exactly matches the specific offering/message a brand wants to share), without sharing ANY personal data with the brand. Stay tuned for more information!\n\n4. Practical aspects – \"show us the money\" – costs\n\nVia this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our data subscription POC. Creating a first proof of concept (POC) of a data subscription on the Cardano blockchain, will require at least a budget of 46.850 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 20 days of senior blockchain developer @ 900 USD per day – totaling 18.000 USD\n\n- 25 days of web/backend developer @ 400 USD per day – totaling +/- 10.000 USD\n\n- 25 days of app developer @ 400 USD per hour – totaling +/- 10.000 USD\n\n- 9 days of legal work (draft contracting language + verify privacy concerns with data on blockchain) @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 8.850 USD\n\nWe are currently already preparing for the development of this solution – which we are trying to pre-finance – because we believe this is a very important functionality in the control of your data. We expect the solution to be ready by the end of Q4 2021, so that we can test it with the companies that are now using the Profila app with their consumers.\n\nWho will be the senior blockchain developer? We are currently in communication with IOHK's professional services department (option 1) and are \"seeking\" in parallel a blockchain developer in the Catalyst community (=those who are interested, please contact myself or Shawn).\n\n5. Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer\n\nAt the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 6, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.\n\n(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila.\n\nWe have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021 (Q1 2022). According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 by the end of 2022 (by adding more brands).\n\n(2) Geographical focus market? We are launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q3 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).\n\n(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy \"Millennials\" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old) that are ware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it; and \"brand-loyalists\" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).\n\n(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.\n\n(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end of 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).\n\n(6) Brand adoption of our solution. Why would brands change their current data use model? The strategy many companies adopted for a while now is big data collection and full use of their data as they please. However, there are many reasons why the tides are changing and a model such as ours will (have to be) be adopted by brands. Just to highlight a few:\n\n- inaccurate data - research shows that many brands hold inaccurate and outdated data, which doesn't help brands serve their customers well but on the contrary poses a bigger risk for data leaks / privacy breaches. CRM systems need accurate personal data, which can only be kept up to data by (and with the consent of) the individual.\n\n- pressure of regulation - recent privacy laws adopted over the entire world (GDPR in Europe, CCPA in USA, LGDP in Brazil, POPPI in SA etc) are making it impossible for brands to continue their existing data collecting practices. Data subjects rights, transparency requirements, data minimization obligations all push brands into our direction.\n\n- promising feedback and testing - The MOST important reason why we believe in our model is our conversations with big brands over the last 4 years. The third slide in our PPT deck attached to this proposal shows a few of these brands that we spoke to. in short: Brands seem to get it. They get it that their data is inaccurate, that they don't really know what their consumers want and how to approach them most effectively; they get it that the new model requires an interaction with their customers. We are now setting up trials with several brands and are confident the (test) data will show that by listening to consumers, they will get a better understanding of how to treat their loyal customers better.\n\n6. Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)\n\nAs an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:\n\nFirst, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.\n\nSecond, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.\n\nIn addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.\n\nFinally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess (and take feedback) on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.\n\n7. Defining success\n\nThe POC we will develop under this Catalyst fund 6 submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to provide people with control of their data and compensation for their attention. Success of the POC would be that we can integrate it into our existing App with one of the 5 SME brands that are testing, and make sure it works with their consumers, and their consumers can get paid via an integrated or linked ADA wallet.\n\n8. Responses to some concerns by the CA's under FUND 5\n\nWe want to end our proposal by thanking the community (advisors) for their numerous great feedbacks during the review phase of our proposal under Fund 4, where we submitted this first step in our \"zero knowledge advertising and insights\" project called \"Dapp to control and monetize your data\". https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/341501-48088.\n\nWe are very grateful and humbled by score and feedback we received from the reviewers, who showed they read our proposal in detail and who provided valuable feedback. #thankyouADAcommunity\n\nWe wanted to briefly respond to some open questions of those who made some reservations, and have included the advisor's questions as well as our responses in the PDF attached called \"CA concerns and Profila remarks\".","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366908-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPritesh is a Cardano enthusiast and ambassador, who has spent several years creating content for the Cardano Community.

These translated resources will include both written and audio versions of **beginner-friendly** Cardano news, insight, and community resources.\n\nThe technical and relational framework built in this phase will allow us to quickly extend our translated content to more languages, and to produce new translated content on an ongoing basis. Language tags, Search Engine Optimization, and grass-roots marketing efforts will be leveraged to spread accessible Cardano resources to new audiences.\n\nOur current website covers Cardano network basics, onboarding paths, news, and insight articles. We invite community involvement by providing an interface to submit new content, comment and respond to existing content, record audio versions of articles, and propose new article ideas. We have 20 existing articles and pages to translate immediately, and we publish new content on a weekly basis. This project will fund translated content for the next 6 months.\n\nOur website already supports multi-language, including:\n\nDetecting User's preferred language, and presenting content in that language if available.\nAllow users to toggle between available languages.\nSome content is already available in translation.

With our community of contributors, we provide hype-free, educational news and insight about the Cardano network that is accessible to everyone. Most online blockchain content is written by and for developers and finance geeks. We are building a network of contributors who break down complicated technical ideas for everyday people, and provide relevant news in quick bites.\n\nOur website is a resource for anyone who wants to learn what Cardano is, why they should care, and how they can participate. We want to make these resources accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nDarlington is an engineer by day and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist and entrepreneur.\n\nStephanie is a teacher and technologist with a passion for helping non-profits navigate and capitalize on technology.\n\n \n\nMotivation\n\nWe see that the next frontier of growth for Cardano won't be confined to Developer forums and GitHub repositories. Instead, it will be among our friends and neighbors, as they start to see and understand the applications of blockchain technology for their own lives and futures. We hope they will see Cardano as the most exciting project out there, and we want to provide a trusted resource to help them learn, get involved, and contribute.\n\n \n\nOur Values\n\nWe believe that Cardano is a powerful platform paving the way for a future that works for everyone. To help connect that future with \"everyone\", information and resources must be available to all kinds of people, and written by all kinds of people. So we put a high value on accessibility and cross-cultural collaboration:\n\nExplain groundbreaking technology in simple terms\nProvide a User-Friendly interface and thoughtful resources\nMeet ADA standards for differently-abled users, including Audio versions of all content\nProvide our content in other languages, including Spanish\nFacilitate original content creation from Spanish speaking community members\n\nHow big is the market?\n\nNearly 600 million people speak Spanish - outnumbering native English speakers!\n\n \n\nBudget\n\n$1,500 Translation of 20 existing news, insight and Cardano onboarding articles for beginners.

And we've already developed the CTS_Community collaboration platform: www.project-cts.org\n\n \n\nCollaboration:\nThis translator platform is part of a larger global translating project \"blockchaintranslation.io\" which includes 3 major pillars:\n\ncommercial platform - Safety in Numbers (Fund5 and Fund6)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/BLOCKCHAINTRANSLATION-IO/369707-48088\ntranslator platform - Project CTS (Fund6)\nnews platform (Fund7)\n\n \n\nOur project:\nWe are already well-known translators in the cardano and ProjectCatalyst community. We see that there are already local Translation-hubs out there. People speak with each other, collaborate, make projects and create cool content. We dont want to create even more hubs, we want to build an bridge between these hubs. We all united by our love to the cardano ecosystem and we are only divided by our languages. So we should support the translators, because they are the bridge that we need.\n\nWe already build up an collaboration-platform, where every one can work with each other. We give them the opportunity to create projects on their own or with others. They also can join projects that are already running. Every work, every data, every thing that you have done is in one main place - on this collaboration platform. The best is, you only need this one platform, this one account, to work with ever project that it part of our network.\n\nNow you ask \"Why one central platform and why an platform at all?\"\nDecentralization is great sure, but the decentralized hubs need to work with each other. We live in an global world, where only the language divide us as people. If we dont connect every hub on one platform they isolate themself. These Hubs are in the end only local groups of friends. Every Hub have their own tools, have their own apps and so on. Someone is using Google, another maybe Slack, and also other maybe have an own App. In the end they dont can work together. We provide one platform for every Hub, every project that they can focus on their local community. The best thing here is, that the software for this collaboration platform is open-source.\n\nFor the Translators, the bridge between every hub, this have one big advantage: They just have one translator account and can work for every project that is part of this network. And because every data is connected with this platform, they dont translate twice or create content twice. Finaly our best thing is that with this platform, we enable second layer translations. In the moment there are just Translators from ENG to their local language. With this platform, we could also onboard Translators from for Example Russian into Chinese.\n\nWe are not an business - We are part of the community. We dont take money - If you fund us, you fund the community.\n\nWhy a new collaboration platform?\n\nYes, we know that there are Discord, Telegram, Google Forms, Google Meet and so on out there. But imagine one place where you can have all of this. One place where you chat, create forms, make meetings and store data. Imagine you just need 1 App for this, imagine you could chat and call people who doesn't have these Apps.\nYou dont need to imagine it, we have made it: The ProjectCTS - collaboration platform.\nIt is one tool for every need. This is time efficient and could safe toolmakers and translators many time.\n\n \n\nSecurity of the platform and the data-sytem\n\nOur platform is secured under the highest industrial standards and is certified with the ISO/IEC 27001:2013. To ensure that no data is getting lost, there will be made several backups daily and to avoid attacks the server are behind multiple firewalls and there were setted up geo-redundant. In the dialog with our hosting provider we already defend over 20 deep attacks on our server.\n\n \n\nOur roadmap:\n\nStarting Point:\nWe already startet the platform in August 2021\n\nIn the next 3-6 months:\n\nWe maintain the collaboration tool.\nWe invite Toolmakers, Translators and also funded project to onboard on our tool.\nWe invite parts of the ProjectCatalyst team to onboard on our platform.\n\nFurther steps:\n\nInvite more people to onboard\nScale-Up the platform for more users\nInvite parts of the cardano team (IOG and the foundation) to onboard\n\n \n\nOur financial plan:\nQ: Why is the financial plan calculated over 12months?\nA: The cheapest payment method for hosting are anually.

Risk Analysis\n\nUtilizing the experience and training through FEMA and the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, we will complete and provide a Threat & Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment & Stakeholder Preparedness Review (THIRA/SPR assessment) to be completed by a certified TEEX Infrastructure Protection Professional.\n\nDevelopment of \"Stake Pool Resiliency and Security\" self-assessment survey. This quiz-style survey compiled by multiple SPOs in this project and the greater SPO community will provide an accurate assessment of current capabilities across the network. The result will benefit the Cardano Community of SPO's with a verifiably documented understanding of the risks and hazards, which will determine the level of capability needed to address those risks. This path allows us to effectively estimate the network's current risk and resiliency, identify gaps, and justify the approach for addressing them through tools like the Cardano Heartbeat CEM.\n\n2. Mass notification system\n\nSimilar to tools like Mellium, participation in the Cardano Heartbeat CEM will grow into the immediate notification of emerging threats like hurricanes, civil unrest, or natural disasters near-critical data centers and bare metal SPOs alike, as well as impulse disaster notifications like seismic activity or cyber terrorism.\n\n3.

Indigo synthetics are intended to be used as money legos in Cardano DeFi protocols, and to unlock liquidity across the world's assets, all on-chain.\n\n#What is a synthetic asset?\n\nA synthetic asset is simply a tokenized derivative that mirrors the price of an underlying asset. Imagine that you want to trade BTC shares without holding the BTC asset itself. Using a synthetic, you can trade iBTC (Indigo Synthetic BTC) instead, which fluctuates in price identical to the underlying asset by tracking and continuously updating its price feed using data oracles.\n\n#Relevant Experience\n\nIndigo Labs is a software development company. We are a team of developers and consultants with Plutus and DeFi domain expertise. Our devs have completed the Plutus pioneers program, are in the top 20% of Plutus contributors on GitHub and are active members of the Catalyst community. Our consultants bring a balance of fintech, DeFi and product development understanding to the Indigo protocol and we are using this experience to build a composable DeFi protocol 'money lego' for the entire Cardano ecosystem. To get in touch with our team or learn more about us, please visit https://indigoprotocol.io/.\n\nKikai Tech is a software engineering research & development team specializing in functional programming, Blockchain and AI. Kikai's list of partners include Cardano DeFi lending protocol MELD as well as AI focused firms Vizgard and Nobi. \n\n \n\n#Deliverables\n\n-Deploy the Indigo v1 contracts to the Alonzo testnet when full smart contract functionality is made available.\n\n-Deliver the Indigo v1 contracts and SDK at the time as Goguen mainnet. The v1 will include full protocol functionality and enable users to mint iAssets that track the price of real world assets using Plutus smart contracts and oracle price feeds.\n\n-The final report of the Plutus smart contract security audit will be made publicly available.\n\n-Weekly development progress reports will be submitted to the Cardano ecosystem (this has already begun).\n\nOur definition of success is accomplishing each of the deliverables highlighted above on time and on budget. \n\n#Indigo Development Timeline\n\nWeek 33 - Aug 23rd - 29:\n\n- Finalize all Indigo-related Web Application Functionality\n\n- Simulations built for all contracts\n\n- Implement DEX functionality into web application\n\nWeek 34 - Aug 30th - Sept 5th:\n\n- Internal Security Audits\n\n- Finalize Technical Documentation\n\n- Prepare for internal testnet deployment\n\nWeek 35 - Sept 6th - 12:\n\n- Continue Internal Security Audits\n\n- Simulation and modeling of economic attacks\n\n- Deploy to internal testnet **\n\nWeek 36 - Sept 13th - 19:\n\n- Continue simulation and modeling of economic attacks\n\n- Deploy bug fixes to internal testnet **\n\n- Prepare for public testnet launch\n\nWeek 37 - Sept 13th - 19:\n\n- Continue simulation and modeling of economic attacks\n\n- Deploy bug fixes to internal testnet **\n\n- Prepare for public testnet launch\n\n- Submit code to Tweag for Audit\n\nWeek 38 - Sept 20th - 26:\n\n- Deploy to public testnet\n\nWeek 39 - Sept 27th - Oct 3rd:\n\n- Deploy bug fixes to public testnet **\n\n- Finalize PAB TypeScript SDK\n\n- Build Mainnet Launch plan\n\nWeek 40 - Oct 4th - 10:\n\n- Continue bug fixes on public testnet\n\n- Review and implement fixes for Tweag Audit\n\nWeek 41 - Oct 11th - 17:\n\n- Continue bug fixes on public testnet\n\n- Review and implement fixes for Tweag Audit\n\nWeek 42 - Oct 18th - 24:\n\n- Deploy Indigo Protocol to Mainnet\n\n** Dependent on progress of Alonzo Hard Fork Event and IOHK's PAB development progress.\n\n#Metrics/KPIs\n\n-Lines of on-chain Plutus code developed per week.\n\n-Number of Github repo pull requests per week.\n\n-Total lines of code developed (on-chain and off-chain) during fund6.\n\n-Number of issues resolved during the security audit. \n\n# Budget/Resource Breakdown\n\nWe have divided the budget out across all deliverables and costs including VAT:\n\nThe Haskell security audit team will dedicate approx. 65 engineering hours to complete the Plutus contract security audit and 2 full time Haskell engineers.\n\n30 engineering hours - Code Review\n\n15 engineering hours - Delivery of Initial Audit Report\n\n15 engineering hours - Verification Review\n\n5 engineering hours - Final Audit Report\n\nFixed cost for this work which is composed of developer's salary, accounting/taxes and VAT: $60,000","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366926-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWhat is our goal?\n\nOur goal is to provide crowdfunding for all. From a small business in Argentina to a 20-year-old in Africa who has a brilliant idea that can change the world. All of this is can be easily done, through the Cardano blockchain. Although technology is advancing exponentially, it is still difficult for businesses to connect with investors.\n\nWe will give businesses the platform in which they can create, manage and sell their tokens. Also small and big investors can browse through lots of innovating ideas and choose to invest whatever amount of money they choose by purchasing their tokens.\n\nWho are we?\n\nWe are 2 young men from Argentina looking to leave a print on the world. After working on different projects regarding investments and cryptography, we decided we wanted to integrate the blockchain into our idea. Currently we are in our crowdfunding phase but we are excited to show the world the potential of Token Allies. The solutions we propose are focused on developing new and exciting technologies that one day will change the world.\n\nHow our platform works\n\nWe have two users:\n\n- Businesses and Start ups: Will have an easy to use platform where they can mint their own tokens and later on sell them to investors.\n\n-  Investors: will be able to browse through different business tokens from all countries.\n\n \n\nInvestors will buy business tokens with a USD stablecoin. Users will be able to deposit into our platform through different cryptocurrencies, but all tokens will be bought in a stable coin. In order to prevent wallet variations on investors and business fundings.\n\n \n\nWhat market are we entering?\n\nBusiness tokenization is still a new industry and is growing rapidly. As more businesses realize the value of blockchain technology, the demand on blockchain services is growing quickly. The more businesses are familiarizing with blockchain, the more they realize the value of asset tokenization\n\n \n\nOur Roadmap\n\nQ1 2021: Planification and execution of the Project\n\nQ2 2021: Private Investing and Crowdfunding\n\nQ3 2021: Expansion of the team and community\n\nQ4 2021: Presale and Exchange listings\n\n2022\n\nQ1 2022: Full Release of the Platform\n\nQ2 2022: Business/investor features\n\nQ3 2022: Voting system and Staking\n\nQ4 2022: New and Exciting features and services\n\n \n\nBudget: Our goal with this is to have a minimum working product when we start our Presale on Q4\n\nThe amount requested would allow us to complete our team\n\n- 15.000 will go to developer salaries till the platform is released (3-5 months)\n\n- 5.000 will go to server costs, legal services and marketing \n\n \n\nOur Coin\n\nAllie Coin (ALLI) is our native cryptocurrency, created on the Binance Smart Chain.Once smart contracts are working, we are migrating to Cardano, where all business tokens will be minted. We expect the migration of ALLI to take place near the end of 2021, before our platform is released. Users whIch hold ALLI will have several benefits on our platform, which include lower deposit and withdrawal fees, voting rights, staking and many features we will reveal soon.\n\nWe are having a presale on ALLI in Q4, while we work on making the first demos of our platform.\n\n \n\nRoad to Decentralization\n\nFollowing the spirit of our industry and the Cardano blockchain, we intend on slowly developing into a more decentralized system where all holders of ALLI will have a vote on how we run our platform. At Token Allies we understand where our industry is going and we intend on leading the way into a decentralized future. This will be one of our long term goals for Token Allies\n\nVoting rights\n\nUsers which hold ALLI will have a vote in what goes on Token Allies. At first we intend on having a controlled system on what businesses get to sell their tokens on our platform, but as our community grows we look forward to our community being an essential part of this system\n\n \n\nWhat is on the horizon?\n\nRight now we aim at delivering the best product to market, but what's after that? We see a future where Token Allies is a big name in the blockchain industry. At this time we aim at business tokenization, but we believe in a world where blockchain is a part of our lives and we want to live in that world. Tokenization is an incredible tool that is revolutionizing the world and we definitely will do our part to get there. In the future we look forward to expanding to new and exciting sectors in asset tokenization and provide real value to our users.

They key to this goal are the translators. We already have many people, which can speak multiple languages and could translate. But we all are humans and need food, water, a home and so on. For that we need some money and actual translations doesn't get paid at all. Ok except from the cardano ambassador program, but this one is limited to text-to-text translations. So in our mind, Translators should get paid from our fundings and for all efforts. Also we should give translators the tools and the knowledge to translate even better.\n\nWith this proposal we want to reserve an amout of Ada, for the following purposes:\n\nGet trainings for translators\nGet better equipment for live-translators\nPay translators for their efforts\n\nIn our mind, we think that we should also establish one standard for every translation. So translators only needed to do what they can - translate.\n\n \n\n \n\nOur own Roadmap:\n\npublic start:\n\nAlain and Jonny translate the weekly TownHall Meeting regularly\n\nIn the next 3 months:\n\nImprove the quality of the existing translations from Translators\nPay Translators which already translated content\nTrain new translators for the Catalyst TownHall\nPromote this Opportunity to attract more translators\n\nIn the next 6 months:\n\nIncrease the awareness about the lack of translations\nincrease the number of dedicated translators for Catalyst Town-Hall\nOffer Translations for proposals\n\nFurther Steps:\n\nEstablish a main translators pool for the whole ecosystem\nExtend the translations over the whole Cardano eco-system\n\nIf you want to go International you need to go Multilingual!\n\n \n\nOur Goals and measurement-metrics:\n\nIn the next 3 months:\n\nHave at least 2 translators every week - at least 1 of them is specially trained\nPromote in every TownHall Meeting the opportunity of translations\nIncrease the possible audience by around 40% in average (We count for every language the speakers that can speak the language as their first or second language - We put this in relation to the possible english speakers)\n*This one is regarding to the challenge-metric \"Number of non-english speakers joining the cardano community\"\n\nIn the next 6 months:\n\nHave at least 4 translators every week - at least 2 of them specially trained\nIncrease the possible audience by around 70% in average (We count for every language the speakers that can speak the language as their first or second language - We put this in relation to the possible english speakers)\n*This one is regarding to the challenge-metric \"Number of non-english speakers joining the cardano community\"\n\nIn the next 12 months:\n\nEstablished an \"compensation system\" for the translators of the TownHall Meeting\nOffer special trainings for every translators who want to get one\n\n \n\nOur financial plan:\n\nLive-Translations:\n75$ per hour of Live-Translation\napx. 100$ per TownHall Meeting\n100$ * 4weeks * 3months * 5 translators = 6,000 USD\nReserve for additional translators = 1.200 USD\n\nTranslator-trainings:\n300$ per Training * 5 translators = 1,500 USD\n\nWebsite and commercial:\n500$ for 6 months\n\nEquipment:\n160$ per Micro * 5 Translators = 800 USD\n\nRequested Amout: 10,000 USD\n\n \n\nTranslation and Languages:\n\nRegarding to an statistic from statista only 510 Millionen people of the world speak english fluently.\nWe want to translate the weekly TownHall Meeting sustainable**.** We think this Meetings is the megaphone of the whole ProjectCatalyst. To do this sustainable and with the most impact we focus on the 13 most speaken languages of the world excluding english:\n\nchinese with 1.300 million regular speaker\nhindi with 525 million regular speaker\nenglish with 510 million regular speaker\nspain with 389 million regular speaker\narabic with 290 million regular speaker\nrussian with 278 million regular speaker\nportuguese with 270 million regular speaker\n\n...\n\njapanese with 127 million regular speaker\ngerman with 118 million regular speaker\nfrance with 107 million regular speaker\n\n*regular speaker are people who use this language as their first or second language in their daily life. We think this is importent that we speak about this complex thematics in an language of their daily life.\n\nFor our own measurement we put the translations in an relation to the english language. For an example:\nIf the TownHall Meeting is got translated into german and france we increase the possible audience by 118 million german speakers and 107 million france speakers, in sum 225 million. 225 million from 510million english speakers are 44,12%. So we increased for this TownHall the possible audience by 44,12%.\n\nThe focus of translations is on the weekly TownHall meeting. We believe that the TownHalls meetings are the megaphone of the ProjectCatalyst and concentrate/summarize the complete governance and politics of an week. So this proposal aim to translate the ProjectCatalyst TownHall Meetings as Live-Translators. Why Live? We think it is important that the viewers of the TownHall Meetings are getting the topic live, to participate in the discussion rounds after the TownHall meetings.\n\nThe training:\n\nActual we dont offer trainings by ourself. The price is calculated that every translator can take part of the \"Blockchain Masterclass\" course by the Frankfurt School. The Frankfurt School is an international known business school and also have it own blockchain research center.\n\nWith this training the translator will learn more about the blockchain and crypto topic overall. The translator can understand what the TownHall meeting experts say and can effectivly translate it. If the participant succesfull finish the course he also will get an certificate from the frankfurt school.\n\nThis will improve the quality of translations and set the translation project on an professional level.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366933-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis project proposes to make our library of Cardano educational content available in Swahili. These translated resources will include both written and audio versions of **beginner-friendly** Cardano news, insight, and community resources.\n\nWe have established relationships with Swahili translators, and are ready to jump into the work of translation. We are collaborating with a collective of young college grads in Kenya who are starting their careers as technology and journalism professionals. These young people are all native Swahili speakers, educated in English-speaking post-secondary institutions in technical fields. Our translation project is a perfect way to introduce these young African professionals to blockchain concepts, establish grass-roots awareness of Cardano in Kenya, provide resources in the local language, and pave the way for future adoption and development of Cardano by and for African people.\n\nWe have a trained linguist and teacher on our team to provide strategic leadership.\n\nOur current website covers Cardano network basics, onboarding paths, news, and insight articles. We invite community involvement by providing an interface to submit new content, comment and respond to existing content, record audio versions of articles, and propose new article ideas. We publish new content weekly, covering breaking news, and Cardano insights, geared toward newcomers and nontechnical audiences. We have 20 articles and pages to translate immediately, and expect to roughly double that number in the next six months. This project would fund the translation of existing and new content for the next six months.\n\nOur website already supports multi-language, including:\n\nDetecting User's preferred language, and presenting content in that language if available.\nAllow users to toggle between available languages.\nSome content is already available in translation. This project will allow us to continue and expand translated content.\n\nThe technical and relational framework built in this phase will allow us to continue translate content written in English as well as source original Swahili content. Language tags, Search Engine Optimization, and grass-roots marketing efforts will be leveraged to spread accessible Cardano resources to new audiences.\n\n \n\nAbout Us\n\nWe are two Cardano enthusiasts. With our community of contributors, we provide hype-free, educational news and insight about the Cardano network that is accessible to everyone. Most online blockchain content is written by and for developers and finance geeks. We are building a network of contributors who break down complicated technical ideas for everyday people, and provide relevant news in quick bites.\n\nOur website is a resource for anyone who wants to learn what Cardano is, why they should care, and how they can participate. We want to make these resources accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nDarlington is an engineer by day and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist and entrepreneur.\n\nStephanie is a teacher and technologist with a passion for helping non-profits navigate and capitalize on technology.\n\nOur Kenya team are recent college grads with backgrounds in technology, journalism, and business. This project is an onramp for them to get involved in Cardano, with an eye toward ongoing collaboration.\n\n \n\nMotivation\n\nWe see that the next frontier of growth for Cardano won't be confined to Developer forums and GitHub repositories. Instead, it will be among our friends and neighbors, as they start to see and understand the applications of blockchain technology for their own lives and futures. We hope they will see Cardano as the most exciting project out there, and we want to provide a trusted resource to help them learn, get involved, and contribute.  \n\n \n\nOur Values\n\nWe believe that Cardano is a powerful platform paving the way for a future that works for everyone. To help connect that future with \"everyone\", information and resources must be available to all kinds of people. So we put a high value on accessibility:\n\nExplain groundbreaking technology in simple terms\nProvide a User-Friendly interface and thoughtful resources\nMeet ADA standards for differently-abled users, including Audio versions of all content\nProvide our content in other languages, including Swahili as a key way to reach a large African demographic\n\n \n\nHow big is the market\n\nNearly 150 million people speak Swahili, making it one of the most useful languages to reach a number of African countries and populations. There's already a robust Cardano community in Tanzania where Swahili is the national language. But there is a need for resources written for everyday people in Swahili.\n\n \n\nDefinitions of Success\n\nTranslations of core website content available in Swahili (20 existing pages/articles in translation).\n\nSwahili translations of new Cardano news and insight articles over the next 6 months (additional 20 pages/articles)\n\nTranslated Content is being viewed in native-Swahili speaking parts of the globe (as captured in Google Analytics)\n\n \n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\n1 Month Milestones: Website UI supports multi-languages, responsive language settings based on end-user language settings, toggling between languages, and participation by community translators. Establish relationships with Swahili translators, and begin gathering translated content.\n\n3 month milestones: All core educational resources on the site is translated and available in Swahili, and a cadence has been established for translating new content (ongoing news, insight, and community-submitted articles)\n\n6 month milestones: Full library of 6 months of new and existing Cardano content is available in Swahili.\n\nFuture: Ongoing Spanish content beyond this launch phase can be sponsored by Cardano Community Support and Stake Pool Rewards. Cultivating relationships with our Kenyan team for locally sourced content by and for Swahili speakers. \n\n \n\nBudget\n\n$2,500 Translation of 20 existing news, insight and Cardano onboarding articles for beginners. Paying 125/article for written translation.\n\n$2,500 Ongoing translation of 1-2 new articles per week plus other site content in the next 6 months. Article average length is between 500-1000 words, other site content includes additional resources and links for people to learn about Cardano, changing and growing on an ongoing basis.\n\n$1,500 Audio recordings of site content in target language, making resources accessible to more people. This amount allows us to record existing 20 articles, plus new content for the next 6 months.\n\n$1200 Developer Cost to continue the buildout and maintenance of multi-language support.

We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.\n\nOur business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.\n\nThis approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services\n\nCOST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.\nMATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.\nTRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?\n\nWe solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. \n\nAnother great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.\n\nThe key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.\n\nFounder bios\n\nGabe Gralla is a software engineer, data scientist, and technology leader based in Boston. He most recently served as Chief Information Officer at Zero, a non-profit building COVID safety apps. Before that, he was Director of Data Engineering at Lyte, an early engineer at Moat (acquired by Oracle), and an independent consultant with clients ranging from enterprise healthcare companies to crypto startups.\n\nSam Gralla is a physics professor at the University of Arizona known for his work on black holes.

Check out a popular public lecture he gave on gravitational waves (https://youtu.be/Dn33_ySzB-w).\n\n(We are cousins.)\n\nTechnical approach\n\nThe web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.\n\nTimeline\n\nDevelopment of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.\n\nThe definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.\n\nThe definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.\n\nThe definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!\n\nCampaign suitability\n\nSince our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal will support the development of our core DApp using Plutus, together with the needed integration into the centralized web app that sets up the smart contracts. We are requesting $15k for contracting work to augment our own efforts.\n\nWhy should Catalyst voters support this project?\n\nWhile the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good \"geek out\" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.\n\nWe would also note some specific benefits to the Cardano community:\n\nThe money will go directly back to the community by hiring Plutus developers.\nPlutus developers will eventually use the expert marketplace we create.\nOur business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common \"lack of developer buy-in\" criticism.\nThe long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.\n\nMore information\n\nWe will be available on the discord server in the tutoring-marketplace channel. You can also message us directly: Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824. You can also contact us using the contact form on our website tutorchain.io.\n\nWe hope to earn your trust in this exciting experiment in decentralized grantmaking!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366962-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe have built a first iteration of the directory, currently living at https://www.lidonation.com/en/catalyst-proposals. This initial version of the directory already allows users to view all proposals, search by title keywords, or filter by fund, challenge, funded status, and over-budget proposals. Users can sort proposals by requested budget and yes votes.

To continue this event we apply for funding to be able to organize and execute two further editions: Idea Fest for Fund 6 AND Fund 7.\n\n \n\nAnnouncement of IDEA FEST Fund 6 in the town hall meeting September 1st, 2021 (starts at 1:00:30):\n\n \n\n \n\n____ INTRODUCE THE HOSTS ____\n\nThe Catalyst Swarm:\n\n\"The SWARM is a community-driven \"grass roots\" initiative, supporting Cardano in its mission to build a universal decentralized system that provides access to a global society and economy.'\n\nCONNECT: We bring the community together to unleash its full potential.\n\nINCLUDE: We build bridges to ensure the diversity of the Cardano community.\n\nEMPOWER: We encourage everyone to act and lead by creating space to do so.\n\n \n\nThe Catalyst Swarm operates and interacts in and around the wider Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals, projects and communities to Project Catalyst. Our activities are characterized by the following qualities:\n\nListen to the community and gather data and opinions from an unbiased perspective.\nHost different events and meetups where the community members come together, share their ideas, connect, listen and get inspired from each other.\nReach out to underrepresented groups in the community, exploring ways to lower entry barriers and offer continuous support and advice.\nIntegrate local communities to enrich a diverse, multi-cultural Catalyst Community.\nModerate the community discussions in our events and Discord server in a way that empowers individuals to further engage.\nExplore novel ways for decentralized governance within our community, based upon practice oriented methods.\nDocument and track our activity to build trust and transparency.\nReproduce ourselves by creating new swarm groups to have a diverse co-existence and collaboration of several swarms.\n\n \n\n \n\n____ I M P A C T _____\n\n \n\nThis challenge is seeking for better communication between proposers and voters. Both parties don't have a stage to interact with each other so far. Also the personal touch of many proposals is missing. Therefore, IDEA FEST for Fund 5 was established and then executed by the Catalyst Swarm Team together with the community.\n\nThis event gives proposers a stage to present their projects and ideas to a wider audience. Furthermore, it enables the voters of Project Catalyst to interact directly with the proposers, ask questions, raise concerns and discuss the projects. This will help the voters to decide on which proposals they want to vote and on which they don't. Added to that, proposers have to work on their presentation skills and try to narrow their project into a condensed pitch. As a result the quality of strategy, objectives and USP of the proposals is likely to increase. The IDEA FEST is a great setting for inexperienced projects to use the stage and become more confident.\n\nFurthermore, the format of the IDEA FEST will attract new proposers for upcoming funding rounds as they see the benefit of presenting their proposals and engaging more people.\n\nIn the first edition of IDEA FEST, 36.1% of the presented projects were successfully funded (compared to 21.6% for Catalyst overall).The approval rate of the presented proposals was as high as 70%, further demonstrating the positive effect of IDEA FEST.\n\n \n\n____ F E A S I B I L I T Y ____\n\n \n\nIDEA FEST Fund 6 details:\n\nDate: October 2nd, 2021\n\nSize: Up to 100 proposers in 15 breakout rooms\n\nModerator: Stefan Montalbetti\n\nHosts: TBA\n\n \n\nIDEA FEST Fund 7 details:\n\nDate: TBA (approx. one week before Fund 7 voting starts) \n\n \n\nPlan for Implementation for each edition of IDEA FEST:\n\nPlaning the event:\n\nEvent will take place in Zoom with different breakout rooms (we will use the Business Zoom Account of IOG as we did for Idea Fest Fund 5)\nCreating Sign-up for proposers\nSetting up schedule for the event\nOrganize and onboard hosts from the community for the breakout rooms\nIntegration of the eastern hemisphere by providing specific breakout rooms for native speakers of our Japanese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, etc. community (by cooperating with the Eastern Town Hall)\n\nMarketing for the event:\n\nAnnouncement in each Town hall meeting, Swarm Sessions, etc.\nUse our online platforms to market the event (Discord, Twitter, Reddit)\nUse IOG channels (Telegram, etc.) to announce the event\n\nRecording and awards:\n\nIDEA FEST will be recorded to create highlight videos of the event and each proposal\nAwards ceremony for proposers\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\nWe have organized and hosted the first edition of Idea Fest.

Currently, 600M ADA are staking with Japanese Stakepools, and that shows Japan is one of the most important countries in the Cardano community.\n\nADA is going to be listed on Japanese exchange BITPOINT(https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/) in 25th August 2021 even though cryptocurrency regulations in Japan are very strict. It will be more important for Japanese communities to increase Japanese SPOs, in order to deliver the right information about Cardano to Japanese crypto-investors.\n\n \n\n#Why Japanese support is necessary?\n\nAccording to an educational research, the average English skill of Japanese people is merely the 53rd in major 100 countries. This research says that majority of Japanese working adults can only make a simple conversation in English.\n\nLikewise, there are a few English-speaking people in Japanese Cardano community, and this leads few people to share technical updates.\n\nThere is only a little Cardano technical information written in Japanese, so that this is one of the biggest problems to make Cardano communities larger in Japan.\n\n・English skills of Japanese\n\nhttps://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h00594/japan%E2%80%99s-english-proficiency-drops-among-non-english-speaking-countries.html\n\n \n\n#Our issues to operate stake pool in Japan and measures that we have done\n\nAll literatures of Cardano ecosystem are written in English.\n\nSo there is a little opportunities for non-English-speaking Japanese to build a Stakepool.\n\ne.g.\n\n・Difficulty of understanding instruction manuals in English\n\n・Difficulty of communicating within English speaker's community when we need to solve technical issues\n\nAfter Shelley hard fork, we started to manage SPO Japan community(SPO JAPAN GUILD) and created a stake pool building instruction manual because we thought that the number of Japanese SPO would not increase without linguistic and technical supports.\n\nOur community and manuals are free of charge, and we have supported all the people even if they don't have knowledge of server operating.\n\nThe fact that there were a few Japanese SPOs in 2020 (before our community run), but now we have more than 60 SPOs in our community!

Our main limiter is funding for the rewards.  \n\n \n\nPlanned Developer Lessons, in English and Spanish\n\nWe use a combination of existing and original tutorials, to fill in necessary gaps without reinventing the wheel. All lessons are open source. \n\n \n\n- Cardano node setup and operation\n\n- Stake pools and stake delegation\n\n- Cardano keys and addresses\n\n- How Ouroboros works\n\n- Writing Marlowe contracts\n\n- Deploying Native Tokens\n\n- More \n\n \n\nP2P learning\n\nIn our system, developers who have passed a lesson are encouraged to go on and teach others that material.

Students are incentivized along the entire pathway. \n\nAt the end of the pathway, developers will be required to create a capstone project. This is aimed at showcasing their skills, as well as creating more valuable open source code for the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\n \n\nTesting & Rewarding\n\nEvery lesson contains a quiz, or a lab, in which the student must prove her knowledge in order to earn.  In-demand skills will be rewarded the highest.  Quizzes test theoretical knowledge, while labs test practical know-how. \n\nCurrently tests are performed manually by a trusted teacher from our community. BWe use a sybil resistance strategy where students have to verify with BrightID (https://www.brightid.org/) before receiving rewards. \n\nWe believe that learn and earn incentives provide strong motivation for many to grind through the difficult to learn code required to create Cardano Apps. \n\n \n\nVision\n\nThe goal is to find and train talented individuals, especially in economically disadvantaged situations,  who would normally not have the time or resources to pour into learning Cardano Development.  We wish to bring them up to a skill level where they can then start earning money as a Cardano developer!\n\nIf you like this proposal, consider supporting us in any way.

Recently, there has been a sharp increase in peer-to-peer crypto trading across Africa.\n\nAccording to Dion Guillaume1. Trading volume in Nigeria surpassed $99.1 million between January and March 2021, followed by Kenya with $38.4 million, Ghana with $27.4 million and South Africa with $25.8 million. Cryptocurrency trade in these countries has been driven by the continued weakening of local currencies which has especially been adversely weakened due to resurgence of the deadly Coronavirus that has impacted the African economy adversely .\n\nMost people in these countries still rely on cash transactions through the bank to trade cryptocurrencies. However, this has been faced by major challenges as some local governments have come up with strict measures and laws to regulate banking services for crypto which has made it costlier and less profitable to trade. Countries like Nigeria have seen crackdowns on some crypto  being instituted and banning financial institutions from processing transactions related to crypto.\n\nHowever, peer-to-peer trading seems to be the only option left for crypto traders in the continent, for traders to continue enjoying crypto benefits. Kenya has been ranked the top country in P2P trading with most people trading with each other locally which helps avoid currency differences and charges in banking transactions (Onyango, 2021). We are proposing a cardano Peer to peer exchange where people within a country and region  can trade and transactions can be done easily through cash or through mobile money which attracts less charges compared to banking transactions. This will increase Cardano adoption and allow people to buy and sell Tokens in Cardano Blockchain easily.\n\n \n\nHow The eUXTO P2P ESCROW Protocol Works\n\nThere are three participants in a token trade on the P2P protocol , the Buyer, the Seller, and the Arbitrator (ie: the platform)\nThe token to be sold in the P2P Market is sent to EscrowOrder script with Escrow Datum. The Datum contains four ​​datum hash secrets, SellerHashSecret , BuyerHashSecret, DisputeReleaseSecret, DisputeRevertSecret\nThe two dispute secrets are owned by the Arbitrator while the buyer and the seller own their respective hash secret.\nThe Cardano Token is Locked and only spendable by someone who possesses the datum hash secrets of two of the three participants in the trade.\n\nThe Escrow Order Script has the following conditions:\n\nOnce funds are placed in escrow, Bob (the seller) can release them to Alice (the buyer) at any time, but not take the funds for himself.\nLikewise, Alice can allow Bob to have the funds back at any time (cancel the trade), but cannot take the funds for herself.\nIf Alice and Bob disagree about where the Token should go, they can ask Volibra to decide who is the rightful owner. Volibra (Arbitrator )can then release the funds to Alice, or return the funds to Bob. However, Volibra cannot take the funds for themselves.\n\nFor More Information , see our Escrow Order Transaction Flow Diagram attached.\n\nOur goal is to use a hybrid decentralised model, where funds and decisions are always in the hands of the user, and where transactions are governed through smart contracts, registered on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nAll transactions on the P2P exchange will be executed with the help of a browser wallet extension like yoroi , that's why we are following the conversation on CIP-0030 | Dapp-Connector proposal (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/88)\n\n \n\nProject Challenge:\n\nTo provide a safe and secure customer experience in our platform , we are face with the challenge of verifying our users identity. In Africa , just like in most places ,Identity exists in scattered Silos and There is no Discovery Mechanism.\n\nIn the short term , We are going to build a Reputation Smart contract to reduce the reputation of bad actors in our system and follow the regulatory compliance of KYC and AML.\n\nIn the future , We will incorporate Cardano's Atala PRISM DIDs to enable the issuance of digital identities to our users and  so we can instantly verify them without Government IDs.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\nI believe the implementation of this project, will reduce the barrier to entry for a typical African with cash to adopt Cardona Blockchain as end users.  secondly as new innovation project launches in Cardano Blockchain , The Africans operating in cash economy would not be left behind.\n\nThe opportunity to trade tokens  with cash will have a big impart not just to the growth of Cardano Ecosystem but humanity. Because when everyone, no matter who they are , where they live have access to Cardano Blockchain and financial services, We all thrive .\n\nHow does this proposal fit into this challenge?\n\nCardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment and platform for mass adoption anywhere\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\n1.  1-3 months post funding\n\nOctober:\n\nUser Research\nUI/UX prototype\nSystem Design and Architecture \n Smart Contract Development Begin\n\n November:\n\n smart contract prototype\nPAB prototype\n Smart Contract Auditing\n  Smart Contract testing and More testing\n\nDecember:\n\n    Backend API prototype\n    Frontend  MVP implementation\n    Yoroi Browser Wallet Connector Integration\n\n \n\n 2.    4-6 months post funding\n\nQ1 2022:\n\nMVP Testnet launch (Beginning of Q1)\nMVP Mainnet launch in one west Africa Country ( end of Q1)\nJoin Accelerator Program\n\n \n\n3.    6 months to one year\n\nQ2 & Q3 2022:\n\n Raise seed funding\nExpand to more African countries\nMore local payment options\nExpand merchant Store Program\n\nQ4\n\nLaunch Reward Token for Users\nRelease SDK\n\nMetrics/KPIs\n\nLines of on-chain Plutus code developed per week.\n\n \n\nLines of front end and backend code developed per week\n\n \n\nNumber of Github repo pull requests per week.\nTotal lines of code developed (on-chain and off-chain)\nNumber of issues resolved during the security audit.  \n\nBudget\n\nWe'll used the fund to hire more Shadowy Super-Coders:\n\n2 Backend Developer: ($2000/mo x3 months: $12000)\n2 Frontend Developer: ($2000/mo x3 months: $12000)\n1 Plutus Developer: ($3000/mo X2: $6000)\n1 Designer: ($2000/mo x2 month: $4000)\nServers Subscription for MVP: $2000\n\n \n\nTEAM\n\nWho is Volibra?\n\nVolibra is a small team of developers building merchant payment Infrastructure on Blockchain.

Agriculture accounts for 30% of the global workforce and for 70% of water use 1. The agricultural and food market is valued at more than 8 Trillion USD worldwide and 1 Trillion only in the US 2. This sector is highly centralized, in the US 4 dominant trading firms control more than 89% of the grain sector 3 where in France, 4 central markets share 91% of food market turnover. 2019 data showed that the agro-food supply chain (ASCs) produce 75% of food systems GHG where 26% of waste is generated by food service and 13% from retails 4 . ASCs lead to intensive food production that have severe consequences on the food autonomy and resilience. Smallholders that directly contribute to food autonomy and resilience, essential to preserve ecosystems, are collapsing. France and Germany report a lack of 200 000 smallholders workers (Deloitte) where ⅓ disappeared from 2000 to 2016 and another ¼ will disappear in 2030 (CRATER) .\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic increase the need for local and transparent food, which can be empowered by blockchain 5. Blockchain traceability solution will reach 886 million in 2025 with IBM Food Trust partner, and iTradeNetwork (Hyperledger), Agriledger and AgUnity that compete to link farmers and industrial. However all actual blockchain solution are permissioned and highly centralized thus tends to raise the technological barrier for farmers and increase inequality between large farmers and smallholders.Thus we need to develop a new solution that can decentralized agriculture and raise mass adoption of farmers for the blockchain.\n\n🍅 Product\n\nA public and decentralized Public blockchain technologies can offer transparent traceability , public data about freshness and quality labeling but can also protect and reward smallholders for their productions and contribution to a safer and secure food system.\n\nDigital Twin (DT) is a representation of a physical product that mirrors its states, behavior, position across its lifecycle. DT for Farm products can store products' details ( shape, weight, taste, variety) current production state (seeding,growing,harvesting), freshness, and transaction (importer, stockage, reseller). 6 7 DT can help provide best-before-date and guaranteed shelf life that can directly reduce food waste 8 and helps farmers to collect data and make better product management and sales decisions.\n\nOur product is a free access platform with comprehensive tutorial to create a robust NFT for farmers that include the following features:\n\nNFT simplified design\n\n We let farmers make and store NFT in their wallet and give instructions to do so\n\nThe platform offer easy and comprehensive step to build an NFT with product data (name, type, geography, living/mineral source, product part), pictures and description through a simplified form translated. To do so we can integrate with existing api\n\nThe platform offer management function for the farmer to manage is NFT portfolio.\n\nUniversal standards\n\nData input from the farmer are register in the Global Product Classification (GPC) standards. GPC partnered with UN/CEFQCT, ISO TC 154, OASIS and W3C, is translated in 16 languages and the actual adopted consensus. 9\n\nThis standard will helps for consumer and Ago-food supply chain adoption\n\nData will be accessible and computer to perform analysis.\n\nTechnical Embeed\n\nProduct and digital transaction can be stored onchain on Cardano\n\nDigital twin NFT metadata can interact with farmers UI, ERP and IOT to mirror the actual state of the product\n\nMetadata also store product traceability and certification information.\n\nThen NFT should show the actionable insight:\n\nProve provenance and product history\n\nCapacity to easily interact with farmers, consumers, cooperatives, suppliers , contractors, certification and inspection in a network dynamic.\n\nUpdate status (status, content, owner) respect with oracle\n\n🎯 Acquisition\n\nWe need to prove to the farmer that this solution is an easy and costless process that can have multiple advantages compared to other Blockachain traceability solution:\n\nNFT will help them streamline the supply chain and audit trail. It will raises awareness for their consumersand helps the mproof the freshness and quality of the products.\n\nNFT removes the needs for third parties, then rapidly farmers will be able to sell their products directly to the consumer, commercant and industrial using ADA or any currencies.\n\nBy register their product on the blockchain, proving their farmers status they can attract banks and investors more easily. Government, NGO and research can also help to detect and rewards farmers and cooperative more easily and perform analysis on food resilience and soil regeneration.\n\nBy proving their daily production and traceability it will be easier for certification center to give their production fair or organic labels.\n\nOthers services can be build on top of this NFT products such auditing, insurance, marketing, NFT swapping and cooperative integration.\n\n🧐 Monopoly\n\nThe platform is open source and made for farmer to increase Cardano NFT mass adoption. NFTs will be build on the Cardano blockchain, GPC standards and design to evolve with farmers and IOT inputs.\n\nWe will provide research effort to design the NFT and create a user-friendly platform that help farmers to build and store their NFT. Thus we will develop a bigger ecosystem to of application and services to support their work.\n\nThis platform will be a first step for consumers, farmers, cooperative, government and NGO to collaborate in an universal NFT framework for farm products and build a decentralized agriculture beneficial for the entire society.\n\n💰 Show us the money\n\nThis project needs a Cardano associate developer and an agro-industrial researcher both granted $5k for the following deliverables:\n\nAn open source platform prototype to create DT-NFT farm products with Github, tutorial, comprehensive data structure, show case and applications.\n\nAn exploratory research paper on DT-NFT farm products with dedicated effort made to develop an open source platform that creates comprehensive NFT stored on the blockchain.\n\nAs a written agreement, the proposal fund receiver is engaged to deliver funds to the main contributors of projects deliverable. Community followers are warmly welcome to help for the project development.\n\n🚗 Getting on the road\n\nFor the next 3 months create the first functionality of the NFT maker and work on the first part of the research paper.\n\nFor the next 6 months the research paper will be completed and submitted, we will improve the platform functionality to integrate iOT and farmers input and associatie with farmers for a beta testing. We will also attract funded to keep on progressing and offer more services.\n\nFor the next 9 months the platform will be fully operational and farmers will be able to generate and manage their own tokens and interact with several services of traceability and transaction.\n\nDefining success\n\nOur mission is to open NFT to farmers for them to become a maker with the same level of technical, legal and bargaining power as agro-food industrial and decentralized agriculture.\n\nBy creating an online platform for farmers to become NFT maker we hope it will protect their ownership, products and prices, improve the supply chain freshness and access credit from collateral. Production will become responsive to local needs and supply chains will be structured around value creation.\n\n📃 References\n\n1. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Whether through hacked YouTube channels, social media, or direct messages, scammers lure new Cardano users to their scam sites, promising giveaways and lotteries. As a result, naive Cardano users end up losing millions of dollars and, could very well, stop their cryptocurrency journey out of fear of future loses. Charles Hoskinson has released at least two episodes on YouTube warning users about scams, further exemplifying how urgent this emerging threat is. While education is a core component of protecting users, it cannot be the only component. We need technical means to protect users in their very first steps of their Cardano journey.\n\n \n\nOur proposal\n\nMotivated by the magnitude of this giveaway abuse, we already built a Proof of Concept (PoC) of our proposed system for early detection and reporting of Cardano phishing/giveaway scams. The backend of this system is currently running on a personal server operated by the PI and the front-end is a dedicated Twitter account: https://twitter.com/CardanoPhishing\n\nThe bot currently works by parsing large lists of DNS zone files searching for domain names that include certain configurable keywords like \"hoskinson\", \"cardano\", and \"ada\". For each such domain, a web crawler is automatically dispatched that scrapes the page, looking for phrases associated with scams (e.g. \"giveaway\", \"hurry up\", \"event\", \"send X ada\"). The scrapes that result in a large number of matched keywords are then marked as potential scams and are reviewed through a special dashboard that we have created. Each true scam is marked as such and then automatically tweeted.\n\n \n\nIn less than a month, our bot has tweeted more than 300 discovered scams (we discover between 5-10 new domain names each day). The reception has been remarkable. Namecheap (a popular registrar and hosting provider) has been consistently taking down the reported scams hosted on their servers and we have gained almost 200 followers from nothing more than word of mouth. We have de-risked this project via this PoC since we know that our approach works.\n\n \n\nWe wish to continue working on this project (transforming it from a hobby project to a real system with real value), hence this proposal. Our proposed areas of work (visible in our attached image) are as follows:\n\n- Expand sources of suspicious domain names, past zone files, including the use of Certificate Transparency Logs and YouTube. We'll need to build continuous integration pipelines to fetch daily lists of domain names, build YouTube bots capable of screen scraping and OCR-ing videos (in search of domains embedded in scam videos), and then dispatching armies of crawlers towards the identified destinations.\n\n- Work on anti-evasion mechanisms before they become an issue. We anticipate that scammers operating these scams will have every reason to evade our proposed bots (detect that we are visiting them and show us benign content). Our anti-evasion mechanisms will revolve around geographical diversity (so that a single IP address cannot be blocked), diversity of crawling software, and other anti-fingerprinting techniques that we will incorporate into our tools. The PI (Nick Nikiforakis) is an academic with 15 years of cybersecurity experience and has built a large number of bots for discovering online malicious content ranging from phishing pages to technical support scams.\n\n- Isolate intelligence content. Other than just reporting the discovered malicious websites, we will work on isolating parts of them, such as, the advertised wallet addresses. We will make lists of malicious wallet addresses available to wallet software and online exchanges so that new users can be warned when they are about to send money to them, and given a chance to read more about giveaway scams. Similarly, we will create lists of malicious IP addresses and domain names that will be available to hosting providers, ISPs, registrars, and operators of blocklists such as OpenPhish, Phishtank, and Google Safe Browsing.\n\n- New dedicated UI and APIs. Next to our Twitter account, we will develop a modern web application where users will be able to retrieve lists of malicious URLs, IP addresses, and wallets. The site will also be the API endpoint for all the aforementioned intelligence that will be provided to interested stake holders. Co-PI Peter Bui is an experienced web developer and has connections with multiple wallet providers that we will use to advertise these APIs.\n\n- Popularization of our tool. The Co-PI of this proposal (Peter Bui) is an operator of a popular Australian Cardano Stake pool and the podcaster behind the \"Leard Cardano\" podcast (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-_2e7L2UgHaJLrGEOJRzA). We will use this podcast to not only keep warning new Cardano users (the ones who are the most likely to be attracted to a podcast about learning Cardano) about these scams but also use the reach of this podcast to connect with stakeholders in ISPs, hosting companies, registries, and web-security companies, who can all integrate with our APIs and protect their users.\n\n- Manual analysis and ML. A stretch goal for this project is the use of supervised machine learning for the final labeling of suspicious web pages. Once our database of known scams sufficiently expands (past say a thousand positive, i.e., scam, samples), we will experiment with supervised machine-learning techniques (such as a Random Forest) to automatically flag the high-confidence scams so that manual analysts can focus their labeling efforts on only a number fraction of suspicious domain names for which the classifier cannot produce a high-confidence label. We have experience using supervised ML for detection of phishing pages, malware sandboxes, and tech-support scams.\n\n \n\nCost\n\nWe request $10K for this project. According to our current projections, these funds will be split 70% towards the development of this system (as described earlier) and 30% towards infrastructure and service costs (such as the cost of virtual machines, larger quotes in geolocation/ASN APIs, and possibly OCR services for scraping suspicious YouTube videos).\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a PoC of our system is currently up and running, reporting scams on a daily basis.\n\nMonth 1. We will port our crawling infrastructure to multiple dedicated cloud servers that exhibit geographic diversity.\n\nMonth 2. First iteration of our separate web frontend showing our so far collected scams\n\nMonth 3. Finish incorporating multiple anti-evasion techniques, additional sources of scam domains, and a working copy of our YouTube scraping bots.\n\nMonth 4. Finalized YouTube scrapers. Design of APIs endpoints for malicious wallet addresses, IP addresses, and hostnames.\n\nMonth 5. Further work on finalizing endpoints. Reaching out to stakeholders. Keep advertising this project over the podcast, and keep educating users.\n\nMonth 6. Bug fixing, exploring our stretch goal of using ML for some/most of the labeling effort.\n\nMonth 6+. Integration with stake holders. Analysis of possible evasions and mitigations for them. Further education via the podcast and social-media accounts.\n\n \n\nWhat is success?\n\nSuccess will be for our bot to keep finding new scams each and every day (i.e. successfully bypass future evasions by scammers) and for at least one stake holder (ISP, hosting company, exchange, wallet provider) to express interest in integrating with our tool. We will also use our social-media presence to collect evidence of takedowns (e.g. such as Namecheap's existing tweets in response to our reports) and stories of users who did not fall victim to such scams, because our tool protected them.\n\n \n\nIP\n\nGiven the very real threat of evasions (i.e. scammers studying our tool and identifying ways of bypassing it so that they can avoid being flagged) we cannot open source the code in the traditional sense of the word. Our code, however, will be freely available to vetted researchers and the Cardano foundation.\n\n \n\nOur team\n\nNick Nikiforakis.

They are mostly using apps such as Youtube and Instagram that are deeply unsatisfying for two main reasons :\n\nNo or very low revenue generated by the published content\n\nNo possibility to have a voice in the future of the service\n\nOn the other side, there are several highly successful projects based on paid subscriptions, yet they are also very centralized (very few teachers benefit from them), and their paywall model won't be attractive for the users in the Web 3.0 economy. We want to be the first ones to build a meditation project in crypto, and we need the support of the Cardano community to do it. We believe this will bring a whole new category of users to Cardano from the vast wellbeing sector.\n\n \n\nIntroducing the CARE token\n\nThe CARE token aims to be a general use token for people who share the values of the care philosophy, oriented toward health, inclusive well being and ecology. It will be created as a native token on Cardano, and its treasury will be managed by the community of holders in order to empower projects related with the care philosophy, the Dyana dapp being one of them.\n\n \n\nUser Experience\n\nDyana will be first experienced as a decentralized application for meditation practices. Teachers will be able to post their audio, videos and texts in order to propose exercises and knowledge to the participants.\n\nInstead of a like button the interface displays a CARE button. Participants can use it to pool the amount of $CARE they choose in order to support the content creator, the system and the community and incentivize them to develop the related topic.

We also will deploy a website (request already sent to CF Foundation to request permission to use \"Cardano\" in the website name using a .org extension).\n\nAddendum: A clarification, we plan to request additional funding for a few months until we can be self-funded. During these next few months, as we introduce student and graduates to the Cardano ecosystem, we hope to help candidates develop Catalyst ideas; Steer them through the process of developing ideas and refining them for submission to the project thereby earning Referrer Rewards.

The update logs should be convenient to find and attached to the existing proposal data and the data will also be open source with the other proposal data so that anyone can use it within other tools and projects.\n\nFor the progress updates the proposers should be able to confirm which of their roadmap items have been completed so the community is able to see a rough percentage of completion as well as any relevant technical or visual information that showcases and confirms that update. The PACE team have done update logs for the project on a weekly basis https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7 which provide a fairly accurate example of the type of updates that funded proposals could complete to provide more information for community auditing.\n\nThis proposal is a follow on from the following fund 5 proposals - improve proposal data https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The enriched proposal data from these fund 5 proposals will be made available in an open source repository that anyone can fork and consume for their own projects. This proposal for proposal progress update logs will build on top of that data set and produce more data for that repository that will get updated through the https://projectcatalyst.org community site.\n\nCreating public progress update logs for proposals will address the challenge by providing an easy way for proposers to provide information about the progress of their funded proposal progress that will make it more efficient and transparent when the community audits their proposals are being executed correctly. The data will be completely open source so anyone in the community will be able to consume or analyse the updates from proposers to distribute the auditing process.\n\n \n\nDesign\n\nCheck the attachments for a design mockup. This design is just to give an idea of what it could look like though please note that both how its executed and the design may change a closer to implementation as we think about the solution more!\n\n \n\nDevelopment steps\n\n- Add a progress update form to the proposal pages so that a proposer can detail out what has happened recently with any links or demos to showcase a proposal update.\n\n- Present the progress update logs on any proposal pages that have added them for the community to view.\n\n- Use existing data for update logs given to IOG for previously funded proposals and add this data to the proposal information so that it is historically up to to date.\n\n- Implement the addition of adding the update log data to the open source proposal data repository so everyone gets access to this proposal update log data.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nGetting existing proposal information into an open source repository will the pre-requisite to this proposal which involves completing fund 5 funded proposals for improving proposal information https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The functionality will likely only take around 2 weeks to complete however there is also manual work in bringing together and likely standardising the historical update data that IOG has been capturing to date which will be added to the previously funded proposals and likely take around 3 weeks to complete. In total the proposal will likely take anywhere from 5 weeks to complete.\n\n- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.\n\n- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.\n\n- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed\n\n \n\nFeasibility\n\n- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps & Darlington has 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Between us we covers the skills needed to standardise the data and host it on a public API for the community.\n\n- Data access - A requirement for this proposal will be getting access to the update logs provided to IOG. As this process needs to be decentralized over time and IOG already provide required data on request this should not be an issue.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\n- Increase proposal progress updates exposure - Public exposure of the proposal updates will benefit the community in auditing any proposals progress and also opens up more opportunity for feedback and support where it's needed. If a team is blocked on a problem the community may collectively have an answer to support proposers execution.\n\n- Inform future voting - Current progress reports from existing funded proposals makes for valuable information to guide future funding decisions. If progress is slow with a well funded team then the progress updates will help provide a way to audit that progress and adjust voters preferences.\n\n- Usage across tools - Public access to this the completion report information should help to allow different types of tooling to emerge such as analytic dashboards or more in depth reports and reviews on different proposals in the ecosystem. The better the data quality and easier it is to access the more likely the community is to create different tools - especially ones concerning auditing!\n\n \n\nAuditability\n\n- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.\n\n- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst\n\n- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e\n\n- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\nSuccess metrics\n\n- Number of proposers submitting proposal updates - We can track how many proposers adds proposal updates through our system providing IOG agrees this could become an accepted input source.\n\n- Increasing the number of people viewing proposals - Tracking the traffic to proposal pages will give insight into the engagement of the community for a given proposal and viewing their progress update logs.\n\n- Increasing the regularity and quality of the updates given by proposers - Setting a standard for the update logs should help make it fast and easy for proposers to provide updates on what is happening. The more proposers that complete this regularly the better information the community has for auditing each funded proposal.\n\n \n\nWhat success looks like\n\nThe success of this proposal will come down to creating an effortless way for proposers to provide progress updates that provides enough information to understand how the project is doing. The second part is that it effectively allows the community to view this information and use the data as needed in any of their own tools or analysis for auditing. This proposal is an initial stepping stone for helping with auditability where a more refined proposal progress update system can be developed over time.\n\n \n\nBudget\n\n- Time required: 5 weeks = 40 hours x 5 = 200\n\n- Time allocation: Research & analysis (10%), Product and design (10%), Data handling (20%) Development (45%), Maintenance (5%), Collaboration (10%)\n\n- Budget = 200 x $55 per hour = $11,000\n\n- Hosting & Software = $500\n\nTotal: $11,500\n\n \n\nPartnerships\n\nWe've partnered with Lidonation https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Treasury-Catalyst-Directory/366965-48088 to help with our existing fund 5 proposals about proposal data (Improving proposal information and project tracking), our fund 6 proposals about auditability and also for their own proposal that will help with improving the access to Catalyst data through a public production ready API.\n\n- Darlington - 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps.

If average losses from slippage could be as large as $1M monthly, we can reduce them to $10K - this gives $990K of profit for traders every month.\n\nThe impermanent loss can reduce liquidity providers income by 10-20% of the invested assets. For a $100M pool it gives more than $10M losses. We can, first, decrease them in 10 times, giving $9M additional revenues; second, give liquidity providers additional revenues from slippage.

Viability of the application will be supported by the fact that no AMM-based DEX is available on Cardano by now and Liquifi V2 will be among the first launched applications of this type. The efficiency of the protocol will allow highly competitive exchange rates that will bring transaction volumes to the project.\n\nLiquidity providers will benefit from low impermanent loss and high APY on investments. New users will also be attracted to the platform by the farming and yield pools features.

It aims to provide liquidity to projects that issue native tokens on Cardano.\n\n \n\nWhy Cardax\n\nThe Mary hard fork (done on March 1st 202) allowed anyone to build native assets on Cardano. Native tokens will bring multi-asset support to Cardano, allowing users to create uniquely defined (custom) tokens and carry out transactions with them directly on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThis, together with the upcoming release of Goguen (smart contract), will allow teams to build descentralized applications on Cardano. It will also allow projects that already exist on Ethereum to start migrating to Cardano.\n\nThis is, of course, great news but it also presents a new challenge since there is currently no decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cardano. So tokens built on the Cardano netwrok don't have a 'native exchange' to list yet.\n\nCardax aims to be that 'native exchange' for the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nWhat makes Cardax different to other DEXs like Uniswap, IDEX or Sushiswap\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEX), in order to provide a market price, usually rely on one of the following systems: Order Book or Automated Market Maker (AMM).\n\nSo, which one is better? Our team has been researching the different systems for a few months and came to the following conclusion: it depends on the kind of tokens you want to serve on the exchange.\n\nThe Order Book model works best when the exchange offers trading pairs that have high liquidity (e.g. BTC/ETH, ADA/USDT, BTC/BUSD). The majority of centralized exchanges use Order Books, including the biggest ones such as Binance, Bittrex or Coinbase. IDEX, a decentralize exchange for ERC-20 tokens, uses the order book model.\n\nHowever, if a market is illiquid, order books don't work that well. You can make an order, but finding a match for it won't be as easy, and you'll have to wait a long time. This often means you will not be able to escape volatility and large spreads occurring in these situations.\n\nSwitcheo is an example of an order book style DEX. After 4 years of launching it has ony 7 BTC in daily volume. It is a bad experience for users who want to trade their assets. Because of the low liquidity users have to wait a long time, sometimes weeks, for an order to be completed. That is if the order can be completed at all. Many times orders stay just open without having been able to find a counterparty to trade with.\n\nAn Automated Market Maker model (this is the type that Uniswap uses), on the other hand, suits better if the exchange offers mainly pairs with low liquidity. The main advantage of an AMM system is that there will always be liquidity for otherwise illiquid markets — at least while there are enough people to invest in a liquidity pool.\n\nHowever, what if there isn't enough liquidity around the desired price to fill a large market order? There could be a big difference between the price that you expect your order to fill and the price that it fills at. This difference is called slippage. This, together with impermanent loss are the main disadvantages of an AMM system.\n\nProjects that issue their own token come to a DEX to find liquidity. Thoug a AMM system allows them to create a new pair (Bobtoken/ADA), it also means they need to have a enough capital in order to create a liquidity pool that is liqwid enough so that they don't end up with a high slippage if a large order is executed. So, the bigger the collateral, the more liquid the pool becomes and lower slippage happens when bigger orders are executed. This is a problem, because many new projects that will launch their own native tokenon Cardano will be small project that won't have a lot of capital upfront (at least they raise capital).\n\nAlso, AMM markets act as uninformed, as the price is set by a pricing algorithm rather than an order book. Read more about it on this article.\n\nSo, is there a way to get the best of the two worlds? Could we have a system that:\n\n- Allows anyone to become a market maker by either starting a liquidity pool or participating in an existing one.\n\n- Minimizes slippage\n\n- Minimizes the risk of impermanent loss\n\n- Provides more price transparency\n\n- Allows token issuers to create a new pair without the need of big amouonts of capital to serve as collateral.\n\nThe Extended Automated Market Maker (EAMM) protocol\n\nWe are currently working on the protocol. This section will be updated as soon as we finish the work related to this task.\n\nWhat are the capabilities of the team\n\n- Members of the team have already worked on similar projects, have worked with Cardano native tokens and operate Cardano stake pools.\n\n- Team leader has 13 years experience in user acquisition and has grown and managed several platforms with users around the globe. https://www.linkedin.com/in/online-marketeer-ryan-morrison/\n\n- The team members have a deep understanding of smart contracts, Cardano native tokens and the overall crypto market.\n\n- Team members have traded cryptocurrencies/tokens since 2017 on both, centralized and decentralized exchanges. They have a good understanding of the experience from a user perspective.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367335-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWatch the pilot episode below.\n\nWe intend to create 1 video per month. 5-8 minutes long.\n\nEvery video should follow 2-3 proposers / funded teams and their story.

While the focus will be a system for the Cardano Catalyst and Voltaire governance, the results will be applicable to the broader Cardano community developing DAOs. Key features of the system will be the ability to detect correlation in voting preference across wallets, use of the correlation measure to form virtual cliques of mutual interest, and use of power-law weightings, such as quadratic voting, to ensure that dominant cliques and/or individuals do not gain oligarchic control of decision making.\n\nProposed Outcomes \n\n(1) To model agent-based opinion, voting, and funding dynamics within the framework of the complex network;\n\n(2) To use computer simulations for the time evolution of interaction network in the opinion, voting, and funding process;\n\n(3) To analyze power-law voting designs and their generalizations for their ability to balance the voting influence, including the role of correlated cohorts of voters.\n\n(4) To design and analyze methods of providing flexible funding levels so that well-supported projects are not eliminated by marginal differences between proposed and available funds.\n\n(5) To design a voting and funding protocol, such as square-root voting across correlated cohorts, for implementation by Cardano Catalyst and other DOAs in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nMethodology and Impact\n\nTo investigate Cardano voting systems Photrek will employ Agent-based Models & Simulations, Voting & Funding Design, and Power-law Statistical Analysis. The outcome will be an evidence-based recommendation for a Diversified Voting & Flexible Funding System.\n\nAgent-based Models & Simulationsconsist of a computational model that simulates the actions and interactions of multiple agents or individuals to re-create or predict the appearance of complex phenomena, where \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". It represents the natural choice for our computational simulation scenario for uncovering the natural laws of voting and expressing opinions. On the other hand, the complex network framework ensures the substantial and non-trivial geometrical features representing the interaction between agents in voting assemblies. The key aspect of the complex network approach relies on the patterns of connection between their elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random, as the real-world networks of people are structured.\n\nThe Monte Carlo method is a statistical method that uses a sequence of random numbers to simulate the evolution of a physical system, especially useful for modeling social voting dynamics. The process is applied to a series of replicas of the same experiment (samples) to determine averaged configurational quantities as a physical result. The Monte Carlo method is exceptionally efficient for the simulation of systems with many local interactions, such as in problems of disordered materials, voting dynamics, consensus formation, disease spreading, and others.\n\nVoting Design & Modelling. From our previous investigation (Cardano Catalyst Fund 4: Diversify Voting Influence), we identified the following power-law voting mechanics worthy of further investigation: Square Root Voting and Quadratic Voting and their generalizations with different powers. These designs empower us to build more effective and balanced voting mechanics for the Cardano ecosystem and to specify flexibility in the funding level of awarded projects. First, we can compose a voting power for each individual that depends on the size of their wallet and the selected power-law weighting. Secondly, the literature indicates that it is important that the voting influence be treated as a budget that the voter allocates across proposals as pseudo investments. This allows voters to concentrate their influence on proposals about which they have strong preferences rather than trying to evaluate all the proposals. Finally, the \"voting investment\" received by a proposal will be used to both rank and specify a degree of flexibility in the funding level awarded. The result is a Voting & Funding Design that balances influence and provides flexibility in assuring broadly supported proposals are awarded an appropriate funding level.\n\nPower-law Statistical Analysis. The output of the voting design, modeling, and simulation will produce a rich collection of information from which we will extract valuable knowledge, noteworthy conclusions, and evidence to support diversified decision-making for the Cardano Catalyst Community. The evidence, conclusions, and knowledge will be formed using careful statistical analysis including statistical moments, such as the second moment and kurtosis. Additionally, because power-law systems have undefined or infinite moments, we will also utilize the innovations of Nonlinear Statistical Coupling, which was developed by Dr. Nelson for the purpose of estimating, generating, and analyzing the statistics of complex systems.\n\nDiversified Voting & Flexible Funding System. In this stage, we share with the community the crucial points of our design and research regarding the implementation of an efficient, mathematically refined, and diversified voting and flexible funding mechanics for the Cardano Catalyst and other DOAs in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nMilestones, Schedule, and Budget\n\nNovember 2021: Prototyping of Agent-Based Model and Simulation\n\n   Lead Staff: Andre Vilela\n\n   Support Staff: Computer Scientists, Hess & Nelson\n\n   Staff Budget: $14,833\n\n   Computer Supply Budget: $1834\n\nDecember 2021: Complete Voting & Funding Design\n\n   Lead Staff: Megan Hess\n\n   Support Staff: Social Scientist, Vilela, and Nelson\n\n   Staff Budget: $16,300\n\n   Survey Supply Budget: $367\n\nJanuary 2022: Analysis of the Power-law Statistics of Design\n\n   Lead: Kenric Nelson\n\n   Support: Vilela for analysis; Hess for dissemination\n\n   Staff Budget: $16,666\n\n \n\nSix Month Milestone: Propose and oversee Fund 7 challenge to prototype diversified voting and flexible funding system\n\nTwelve Month Milestone: Collaborate with IOG Voltaire team to implement diversified voting and flexible funding system\n\nReferences\n\nSquare-Root Voting\n\nWerner Kirsch, On Penrose's Square-Root Law and Beyond, in Power, Voting, and Voting Power: 30 Years After, Heidelberg: Springer, 2013.\n\nK.

For the Project Catalyst community, the use of an identity solution can help with allowing community members to build up a reputation and trust in a way that can be self owned and verified. Atala Prism will offer the building blocks to start creating a digital identity, where people will have ownership of that identity and can verify it to other people and protocols.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to develop tools and provide examples for some of the foundational blocks of Atala Prisms initial implementation of self sovereign identity (SSI). This includes both decentralized identifiers (DID's) and verifiable credentials (VC's). The proposal will help projects establish themselves as issuers and provide credentials to community members based on a certain condition. The initial verifiable credentials for this proposal will focus on verifying participation and completion within community projects.\n\nThis work can be expanded on in future proposals, where we can also look at how trust and reputation networks could be introduced using things such as ADA as trust collateral or endorsements from trusted people for helping with reputation.\n\nThis initial proposal addresses the challenge as it aims to provide a simple way for the community to start using the identity solution using Atala Prism. This allows the community to build up their knowledge on its importance and also helps provide open source examples for other developers looking to integrate Atala Prism. Increasing awareness and usage of Atala Prism identity in the community along with helping speed up developers integration of the identity solution by providing examples should help with driving faster adoption of Atala Prism.\n\n \n\nExample credentials\n\nThe following are two examples where you could issue some simple participation or completion credentials. Other projects could use the same source code to achieve a similar outcome!\n\n- Catalyst Swarm Attendance - Issue an attendance credential to people who attend after townhalls or weekend sessions to let people know who is active in the community session.\n\n- Catalyst School Workshop Completion - Issue a completion credential to people who completed a Catalyst School workshop to showcase their new knowledge.\n\n \n\nCommunity credential tools\n\nThe first and main part of this proposal is providing the tools necessary for a community project to issue credentials to another person that has an Atala Prism identity wallet. These tools will make use of VC's and DID's. The idea behind the code for these tools is that other community projects could copy it and change what they want to about the credentials and use it for their own use case.\n\n \n\nprojectcatalyst.org verify integration\n\nThe additional smaller part to this proposal is providing an example of how you could verify an issued credential. The verification step consists of checking a credential against the trusted issuer address and that it is valid. We will integrate a verification process into the projectcatalyst.org site to showcase a simple example of verifying a credential by letting community members add the credential to their profile. This added example will guide other projects integrating Atala Prism on how they could verify credentials in their own application.\n\n \n\nDevelopment steps\n\n- After the launch of Atala Prism we attend and learn from the associated pioneers program\n\n- Determine appropriate data to add to the participation or completion credentials\n\n- Develop the tools needed to issue and verify credentials for the project team\n\n- Document steps to issue credentials to a given community member\n\n- Integrate the verification of a given credential issued by respective project teams so that they can be added to a projectcatalyst.org community member profile\n\n \n\nEducation workshop\n\nAfter we've completed development of the tools for issuance and accepting credentials for community projects along with the verifying example on the website we can then look at providing a workshop at a After Town hall to answer questions and support other projects looking to integrate Atala Prism.\n\n \n\nIn the workshop we will showcase the product, reveal how projects can use the credentialing system on the projectcatalyst website and discuss different examples. Depending on the feedback we will iterate and use the input to further develop the product for upcoming funding rounds.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nIn the short term, an accurate delivery time will be difficult to provide for this proposal as the work has the pre-requisite of having Atala Prism available to develop with. It has been mentioned previously this should become available in Q4 of 2021. Once the date is confirmed and the documentation is available, it will become easier to determine more exact dates of delivery. We can provide a roadmap for the development work to be completed where it should likely take anywhere between 5 to 7 weeks to develop after Atala Prism is available followed by at least 4 weeks for onboarding, monitoring and collecting feedback. The completion time could be slightly reduced or extended based on how easy it is to work with Atala Prism in its first iteration after launch - which for the moment is an unknown at the time of finalizing this proposal!\n\n- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community\n\n- 6 months - Monitoring and analysis of results, should finish a completion report in this time frame\n\n- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed\n\n \n\nFeasibility\n\n- Technology - The PACE team joined the Atala Prism After Townhall and confirmed that the core parts of self sovereign identity (DIDs and VCs) will be functional when Atala Prism is launched. See\n\nThis proposal as a result is technically feasible after the launch date of Atala Prism as planned and builds upon some of the core concepts of self sovereign identity.\n\n- Team - George has spent a couple of months already looking at self sovereign identity space in a previous proposal https://servnetwork.org and has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps.\n\nImpact\n\n- Awareness - By helping existing community projects, the execution of this proposal should help to provide increasing awareness to people who join the community and get involved in different ecosystem projects.\n\n- Community adoption - By showcasing the possibilities of participation and completion credentials for community projects the community adoption of Atala Prism will increase.\n\n- Developer adoption - Examples of integrating Atala Prism will help speed up other developers integrating solutions into their own applications and also potentially help other developers generate ideas on how they could also integrate Atala Prism into their own applications.\n\n- Shared learnings - Our experience of creating tools to help the community will provide useful learnings we can share with the community to prevent common pitfalls\n\n \n\nAuditability\n\n- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.\n\n- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst\n\n- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e\n\n- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\n- The workshop after developing the Atala Prism solution will be recorded and uploaded to Youtube\n\n \n\nSuccess metrics\n\n- Number of credentials issued and verified - One metric to assess success will be trying to attract a large number of the community to engage with using the solution to get participation or completion credentials. We can track how many people are issued credentials by community projects and also how many try verifying the credential on the https://projectcatalyst.org website after the first few months of completing the proposal development work.\n\n- Usage of source code & technical discussions - A more qualitative success metric will be helping other projects start using Atala Prism solutions.

However, it is becoming apparent that it is too difficult or even impossible for the average voter to make a good selection or even just to get a reasonable overview of all the projects and their potential value - that is where we kick in.\n\nImagine that someone has already been addressed to the troubles of pre-selection from the incredibly large offer and sorting it. What if someone eligibly analyzed and prepared this selection for all the voters to get insight on a general and above on a deepened level? This would give all users of the Cardano Government system a tool of understanding to select projects which they really want to support and which they really understand through our general and in-depth analysis.\n\nAs an independent non-profit organization (which shall be merged with the excisting voting structures by the Catalyst Community Advisors (CA's and vCA's) using an edited incentive system), we stay neutral and follow the philosophy of making the Cardano ecosystem easily accessible to all users and allowing them to participate in the voting system in the best informed way as possible. To achieve this, we use sophisticated evaluation keys arranged in more evaluation categories than before. We also focus particularly on communicating the results of our analyses to users and/or voters as coherently as possible while providing further in-depth information for more advanced users and/or voters.\n\nSo, why did we decide to establish a non-profit organization? We are utterly aware of the great responsibility entailed by the growing scope of necessary evaluation and classification of the projects. In our eyes, only a non-profit organization might be in the position to act with the right mindset coping with these tasks on the one hand and on the other to be able to represent the claim of acting on behalf of the entire Cardano ecosystem - without having to represent any own economic interests.\n\nIt is one of our principles that every project participating in the Catalyst voting is analyzed carefully, unbiased and fairly.\n\n \n\nThe projects available for voting often require advanced technical knowledge and hence, are not comprehensible for everyone. Project details are limited when using the Catalyst App or further information require to log in to Cardano Ideascale. Unfortunately, the Ideascale website is not easily accessible and not clearly structured. It is hard to keep an overview of all the projects available and more often only those which already received a certain amount of feedback will show up on the first pages. Furthermore, the Ideascale website with all its projects is not clearly structured by subclasses of projects, which would allow for a better access for users and voters because of better categorization. It would be a lot easier to find a preferential project when implementing the division into subclasses and the assignment of the several projects to it.\n\n \n\nThe aim of our \"Catalyst Compass\" project is to provide a more detailed evaluated and categorized overview of the current Catalyst fundraising projects for the people. We want to reform the Catalyst project's assessment system by providing a more in-depth analysis composed of a coherent summary and a broader spectrum of evaluation categories. This means we will make the Catalyst projects accessible and comprehensible for all potential users of the Cardano blockchain and for all the voters of the projects, depending on their level of technical, structural, economic, social, etc. understanding.\n\nHence, the general project's overview, evaluation and summary are to be followed by an in-depth analysis regarding the individual project's challenges, claims and aims. Being as diverse as all the projects are, we will keep in mind the necessary wide spectrum of potential experts (Community Advisors and evaluating Community Advisors) to competently assess all the aspects of the several projects.\n\nOur moderators (composed of the vCA's) will provide a selection of the most promising projects, after the projects were assessed by the CA's. For this, evaluation keys have to be more detailed, e.g. in form of a classified scale to evaluate the economic, social and perhaps even political benefits, the estimated initial and ongoing costs and others like the already excisting category of feasability. Therefore an own point of view has to be defined concerning the community's attitude torwards decentralization, wealth distribution and who might benefit or suffer from a project's outcome. So, the assessement will have a broader classification and hence, will be more significant.\n\nTo stay with the thought of decentralization, the rules of becoming a CA and vCA/moderator will stay the same as they already are so, everyone can register as a CA and will not be excluded, as long as he/she is providing proper assessments according to the rules of assessment as there is.\n\nTo implement our \"Catalyst Compass\", we will issue and maintain a standalone website which is intended to be linked to the Catalyst Community and the Cardano-ideascale websites.\n\n \n\nOur analyses intend to ensure that every participant in the Catalyst voting system is provided with coherent enough explanations and information of his/her preferred projects so that everyone is able to compare the projects with each other and by that, vote for the very project which in his/her eyes deserves it the most.\n\nWe aim for an understanding of the several projects, no matter what the educational or technical background of the voters might be, so that everyone can give his/her vote with the highest possible level of awareness.\n\nTherefore, to underline our claim to provide coherent access to the several projects for all participants, we further aim to implement our website as a multilingual platform to reach even more potential prospects. Everyone should have the opportunity to dedicate his/her valuable vote to the project that deserves it. Our general and in-depth analyses and a clear presentation of them with many comparison parameters are key in the process.\n\n \n\nWe as Catalyst Compass offer a web platform which describes and evaluates the different projects for each current fund. The evaluation will be done rolling from fund to fund.\n\nThe evaluation methods like the analysis method will be standardized and given to the community advisors.\n\nso that a comparison of the projects will be possible.\n\nThe following will be the tasks of Catalyst Compass team:\n\n- Provision, maintenance and upkeep of the website\n\n- Manage / pay staff (moderators / community advisors)\n\n- Create / predefine / analyze and if necessary adapt evaluation methods\n\n \n\nThe members, staff and helpers stay in contact with each other via internet. For collaboration we will use platforms and services like e.g. Discord. This type of networking is completely sufficient for the demands of our work and as a result the acquisition and management of a central office is unnecessary.\n\n \n\nThe staff is composed of about 10-25 moderators who are taken from the pool of vCA's, CA's and/or others. Furthermore, experts will be needed who assess the projects and above that, give a coherent summary of the evaluated project. The experts act much like the already excisting CA's.\n\nThe tasks of the moderators is to assign and register the experts (CA's) to the projects assessed by these experts. Moderators also ban or remove experts in case of gross violations of agreed rules and/or inappropriate formulations (the basic agreements are to be taken from the already established Catalyst Community agreements).\n\nIn addition moderators are to formulate a single, aggregated summary of a project based on the information/summaries provided by the experts assessing the specific project. The summary is to be formulated as coherent as possible for the Catalyst Voting participants and it shall be broken down according to criteria like e.g. economic, social, political benefits, costs, technical and personal requirements, beneficiaries and disadvantaged parties, environmental issues, aspects of decentralization, and others.\n\nAnother task for the moderators is to place the projects according to individual topic into groups, so that voters and potential users of the Cardano blockchain projects can access them in the easiest way possible, without having to navigate through an opaque and confusing jungle of projects like there currently is.\n\nThe experts registered and assigned by the moderators are given the main task to assess the projects by the mentioned criteria which are organized in more than the already excisting categories (impact, feasability and auditability) and above that, experts will give a coherent summary of each assessed project which is to be aggregated by the moderators to form a single summary which will be presented on the \"Catalyst Compass\" website. The summary must be comprehensible in general and furthermore give a detailed explanation concernig information in regard to technical, economic, political, etc. requirements.\n\nThe summary will be to give the Catalyst voters sufficient information about the specific project in order to let the voters make their vote with the highest possible level of awareness.\n\nThe incentives for experts (former CA's) and moderators (former vCA's) shall be processed through the fund raising budget and have an upper limit. This should prevent the number of potential experts to rise too high by limiting the payment for them either by an absolut maximum of payment or an absolut maximal number of engaged experts.\n\n \n\nWe aim to reform the Catalyst Community's assessment system based on the Cardano-ideascale website, to provide a more detailed and thus more accessible evaluation and presentation of all the upcoming projects set to be voted for by the Cardano community.\n\nHence, we want to merge with the Catalyst community and all the dedicated vCA's and CA's from there, to process the projects on an own website, but still keep the Cardano-ideascale website as a basis from which all the on our website assessed and presented projects are to be picked.\n\nThe internal collaboration shall be processed by the common and already established gateways via internet like for example: Discord.\n\n \n\nThus, we expect to get our project working within the first 1-3 months after the current Fund6 period. It only depends on the speed of the transition process adopting and appointing the moderators and experts from the pool of the current vCA's and CA's to our Catalyst Compass projects assessment system. A preliminary website has already been established (https://github.com/Catalyst-Compass).\n\n \n\nWe are currently cooperating with the Cardano Smart Voting proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Smart-Voting/367168-48088) and try to merge both our ideas into one project. By implementing the proposed Smart Voting the assessing CA's shall be clustered into groups formed by consensus of interest and know-how. This would give rare assessment classes (e.g. because assessing a certain proposal needs knowledge which might be pretty rare) a higher value than others, which are more common and coherent for most advisors. By that, positive assessments of proposals, which suffer from a lesser attention only because the technical insight might not be as coherent and easy as those of other proposals, will become more valuable and thus receive a greater attention.\n\n \n\nThe number of participants in Catalyst voting is increasing rapidly, thus there is a need for user-friendly processing of the projects' evaluation and presentation which continues to grow accordingly. The benefit of our project is therefore beyond question and our \"Catalyst Compass\" team is working diligently and dedicatedly on its implementation. Basically, there is no question whether the project can be successful - it is an absolute must and will be a very useful tool for all users of the Catalyst Voting to orientate and appropiately evaluate the presented projects for themselves.\n\nWith 70 proposals funded in the Fund5 period and about 250,000 total votes from about 33,000 unique wallets (compared to 12 projects funded with about 24,000 votes in the period of Fund2), we have already reached an extent which needs to be managed by a dedicated group of people, specially composed for this very reason.\n\n \n\nWe are looking for active members who would like to share their ideas of how to make the voting easier for everybody. Thus, we would like you to become a member of our team if you are dedicated to support our project either with your ideas or by implementing our ideas. There is a lot of work to do and we are currently incapable of doing all this on our own. We need more active members who are willing to contribute to our project by co-creating, leading and supporting the ideas and the processing of this proposal. Every member will receive an allowance for any kind of useful input. To join our project, simply write a comment down below and we will invite you to our Discord channel, which is arranged for this very project.

To continue down this path of being the \"most environmentally sustainable\" cryptocurrency, Cardano should further align its values and goals to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). UN has 169 associated targets and over 5000 active actions with various sectors to build a sustainable future. UN has set a 2030 Agenda, called Catalyst 2030, that has over 39,000 full-time employees in 71 countries serving over 180 countries and has reached over 4 billion people worldwide. By aligning Cardano's values with the SDGs, Cardano will be able to connect with a vast number of corporations that are actively supporting SDGs which can in turn increase mass adoption rate towards Cardano. To bring Cardano's vision of success a reality, WottleNFT aims to do just that.\n\nWottleNFT strives to be the first Sustainable NFT Auction Site that aims to build an interconnected ecosystem between Cardano NFTs and Social Enterprises. The reason why Cardano should work with Social Enterprises is because they are the driving forces behind SDGs. In 2020, there are more than 600 member institutions and 900 individuals working in more than 190 countries that are covering all 17 UN SDGs. The impact of collaborations with social enterprises is also shifting philanthropies by breaking down traditional silos that are interconnected, such as education, health or nutrition. If Cardano were to assist Social Enterprises worldwide, it can not only accelerate UN's progress towards achieving the 2030 SDGs goals, but will also be able to change the hearts and minds of funders to a more holistic and systemic approach towards fundings.\n\nTim Hanstad, a former social entrepreneur and current CEO of the philanthropic Chandler Foundation shares that \"You can't effectively educate a systemically malnourished child, and by tapping into networks such as Catalyst 2030, philanthropic organisations can more effectively evaluate need and apply their respective funding strategies to the problem as a whole. This way of working is not without its challenges, but we are seeing this is increasingly accepted as the way to go in the future.\"\n\nSocial Entrepreneurs are fuelled by a sense of urgency and a passion to deliver an impact. There is only have nine years left to achieve the SDGs. Only by working together can we stand a chance of making a difference to the lives that matters most.\n\nHow does WottleNFT work?\n\nThe business model of WottleNFT works similar to that of a social enterprise, with a twist. On top of royalties, a portion of the auction fees that WottleNFT collects, are channeled towards social enterprises. After an NFT auction has ended, the highest bidder will get to choose one of the 17 SDG goal that he/she supports. Afterwhich, he/she will choose a social enterprise that supports that underlying SDG goal. Once chosen, the smart contract will automate the auction transaction and channels the fees towards the chosen social enterprise. Since these donations came from the highest bidder, his/her efforts will not go unnoticed. Each profile on WottleNFT will have a transparent track-record of his/her contributions to Social Enterprises worldwide. Doing so, WottleNFT is not an ordinary NFT Auction Site, but a gateway to connect Social Enterprises with the Cardano Community.\n\nRoadMap\n\nPhase 1 (May - Aug 2021)\n\n- Ideation\n\n- Launch of Instagram\n\n- Launch of Twitter\n\n- Launch of Discord Server\n\n- Launch of Landing Page v1.0\n\n- Launch of Staking Pool WOT\n\n- Tokenomics Ideation\n\nPhase 2 (Sep - Dec 2021)\n\n- RoadMap\n\n- Launch of WottleNFT Tokenomics (More details will be released soon)\n\n- Building a global community with Social Enterprises, NFT Collectors and Creators\n\n- Launch of Landing Page v2.0 with Auction Testing\n\n- Minting of Utility Tokens / NFTs\n\nPhase 3 (Jan - Mar 2022)\n\n- Launch of WottleNFT Auction Site v1.0\n\n- Expanding WottleNFT Team\n\nPhase 4 (Apr 2022 -)\n\n- Upgrade of WottleNFT Auction Site v2.0\n\n- Minting of Utility Tokens / NFTs\n\n- Expanding WottleNFT Team\n\nFunding Breakdown\n\nStaking Pool\n\n- Raspberry Pis ($500)\n\n- Set-Up Cost ($2000)\n\nMinting Utility Tokens / NFTs\n\n- $1000 ($10 per Utility Token / NFTs)\n\nSoftware\n\n- AWS EC2 Instance ($120/month) -> $1200 for one year\n\n- Dynamo DB ($40/month) -> $480 for one year\n\n- Blockfrost API ($69/month) -> $828 for one year\n\n- Professional Email ($21/month) -> $252 for one year (for one user)\n\n- Typeform ($40/month) -> $480 for one year\n\n- Domain ($1/month) -> $12 for one year\n\nSmart Contracts\n\n-> $10,000\n\nGrand Total = $2500 + $1000 + $3252 + $10000 = $16,725","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367158-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nBlockchain Power, LLC is the Delaware (United States) limited liability company behind the NFT with the goal of offsetting 100% of the power used in blockchain creation and management. The two founders have developed several gigawatts of solar projects globally and have 12 years experience with solar development and funding.  Greg S.K. Ness created many of the contracts currently used by financial institutions, utilities and developers related to securing land rights, providing interconnection, purchasing and selling power and securing capital that are currently in the market.  Jon Downey currently serves as the CEO of one of the largest solar energy development companies in North America and has successfully led numerous capital raises in the renewable energy industry. \n\nProposer LinkedIN Profile:\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/gregness2021/\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jondowney1/\n\nWe are proposing a specific and recurring use case with NFTs to solve for the constraints to renewable energy development. The constraints are project realization uncertainty and pricing hurdles caused by the following: 1) the high costs to interconnect a renewable energy project to the utility grid; and 2) the lack of regulatory transparency.\n\nOur non-art NFT based model will drive even greater demand for NFTs, increase adoption of Cardano, amplify use of the network, and show the public what's possible with NFTs.\n\nRegarding Point 1 (the high costs to interconnect to the grid) - in many districts/states/territories, renewable energy project developers and owners must pay to build facilities and upgrade grid infrastructure in the areas they will be operating their renewable energy project. These costs are often the most significant expense outside of the construction of the power facility itself and cannot be controlled by the developer/operator. Pricing is typically set by grid operators or study boards with limited or opaque transparency in terms of their model and governance.\n\nAdditionally, and addressing Point 2, the regulatory authorities and government bodies in many states/countries/regions have been reluctant or have refused to provide transparency with respect to energy pricing models and interconnection procedures used by utility grid operators/owners. This has led to lower pricing for renewable power since it is hard to determine accurate market pricing for the power generated by the renewable energy facility.\n\nLikewise, as government leaders are voted in and out of office, the shifting priorities within government administrations and between different levels of government create uncertainty during the years-long process of developing renewable energy facilities both in the United States and globally that increases both costs (due to capital risk premiums) and attrition rate. For example, Candidate A may have a strong interest in fossil fuels and create legislation that further allows the grid owners and operators to work in the shadows and set arbitrary pricing, while his/her predecessor may have done the opposite. In other words, two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFurther, in many regimes, any government support from a favorable regime only comes after the facility is operating which necessitates earlier rounds of expensive capital to bridge the time between development/construction start date and the commercial operation of the project.\n\nThe problem's financial cost is vast. \n\nThe calculations below assume a total offset need of 170 terawatt hours tWh with all of the energy production coming through solar and solar+storage at an average efficiency rating of 22% and average cost of $1.00/kw.  For those outside of the energy space, a terawatt-hour (TWh) is one trillion Wh, or 1,000 GWh\n\nThus, according to these calculations, we would need 88GW of capacity at a cost of $88B to offset all energy usage. However, this analysis supposes that we are paying for 100% of the cost of the power facility. Instead, we will often only be granting/loaning the amount of capital necessary to make renewable energy facilities economic on an expedited schedule (by offsetting, for example, high Interconnection costs or equipment price spikes). Under this scenario, we anticipate funding only 10%-20% of the aggregate renewable energy facility development cost while relying on traditional funding mechanisms to provide the balance of the capital stack. With this strategy, we would need to deploy between $8.8B and $17.6B.\n\nGoing deeper regarding what's currently available in the market, there are generally two commonly used mechanisms to encourage renewable energy development globally – government tax credits/direct funding and Renewable Energy Credits (REC's/SREC's/carbon credits). While helpful, these tools are significantly constrained by their very structure as explored below.\n\nRegarding Renewable energy and carbon credits (often referred to as \"RECs\"), they are often purchased by power generators and large corporations to offset their carbon-based energy production/usage (not for a profit motive). However, RECs and carbon credits have two major problems. First, is the timing of cash receipts which occurs as the power is produced, which, similar to tax credits, necessitates expensive bridge capital. Second, there are the inefficiencies of the market itself given relatively illiquid markets in many places which leads to substantial pricing variances between similarly situated renewable energy projects. Additionally, these markets tend to be relatively inaccessible to small investors looking to offset their own carbon footprint (indeed, how many of you reading this would know where to go to buy a REC in Europe or the United States?).\n\nWe believe that proof-of-stake blockchain technology is the best tool to use to solve the energy issues created by increased blockchain deployment, regulatory hurdles and fossil fuel centric political agendas. The ecosystem created by a solar energy NFT will directly make more renewable energy projects viable by injecting capital at early stages of the renewable energy project development life cycle and by offsetting high interconnection and equipment costs.\n\nIn addition, the ecosystem:\n\na. Provides a means for blockchain technology to directly offset CO2 emissions through USD or stable-coin currency transfers to renewable energy projects; and\n\nb. Provides a means (NFT Badge) for companies and sustainability funds to readily show evidence of their support for CO2 offsetting renewable energy projects to all stakeholders.\n\nProcess:\n\n1. ADA owners purchase the NFT at the level of their support which can be displayed on all social media or traditional media platforms.\n\n2. Blockchain Power provides grants and low interest loans with the capital generated through NFT sales to developers and potential owners of solar energy projects globally.\n\n3. If loans are provided, repayment of the loans provides additional capital to be re-deployed to additional projects.\n\n4. The Blockchain Power team, using its expertise in global renewable energy project development will work with regulated utilities regarding payment of the upgrades, and collaborate with stakeholders on making sure the utilities use the capital for the required infrastructure upgrades.\n\nIn the future, we also have a strong interest in creating a solar token based off the Cardano blockchain that we call the \"DEPWR\" Token, and in such event, we'd use the structure below:\n\nIf and when we create the DEPWR token, with assistance from the community and others, the process would be:\n\n1. Blockchain Power sells DEPWR token;\n\n2. DEPWR token owners purchase the DEPWR NFT at the level of their support which can be displayed on all media (we can use https://www.cnft.io/ or other platforms as necessary). \n\n3. Tokens used to purchase NFT's are resold to market or added to reserves for other solar projects\n\n4. Blockchain Power provides grants and loans with the capital generated through token sales to developers and owners of renewable energy projects (similar to Phase I);\n\n5. If loans are provided, repayment of the loans provides additional capital to be re-deployed to projects (similar to Phase I).\n\nFor many funds and investors in the blockchain space (as well as outside of it), an easy means to communicate their support for renewable energy to offset their carbon footprint is a critical and missing piece. The solar NFT also solves this problem. By using ADA to purchase the solar NFT, supporters will be able to display their support on websites and marketing materials globally. It is the badge that proves your commitment to carbon-free energy production. Further, it can be easily validated by auditors through the blockchain itself.\n\nThe initial goal of the Blockchain Power ecosystem is to provide a safe, transparent and convenient source of liquidity to bring renewable power projects to fruition and to provide supporters of such enhanced renewable energy asset deployment and carbon reduction with a means to quickly show stakeholders and the general public the scale of their support. We can drastically hasten the adoption of renewable energy through our investments – greening the entire global grid and more than offsetting any negative CO2 impacts from non-renewable crypto mining.\n\nAn interesting recent article on some of the problems related to the United States power grid can be read here:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/29/power-grid-problems/\n\nOne questions that might come up is how do you guys know where to target grid upgrades?\n\nOne quick way is as follows:\n\nWe can use a Power Flow software (PSSE, PowerWorld, etc.) to study the utility's grid and how the elements (substations, transmission lines, etc.) are impacted by the addition of the new solar energy generation. This approach can be used for a statewide or regional electricity \"injection\" analysis (higher level) or a specific point of interconnection Injection Analysis. Or we can receive proposals from communities and developers and help run the analysis as needed. \n\nCritics of the idea that renewable power can be used to \"mine\" crypto currencies because of time-of-use versus time-of-production inconsistencies (i.e., you can't produce solar power at night so any mining at night must be stopped to have a \"green\" coin), while technically correct, miss the larger picture – that renewable energy deployment within the current framework and its global adoption is still in the emerging stages. As such, the conversation around achieving a sustainable energy grid and matching a specific electron produced to its end use and calling it green or not makes no sense at this point. Our goal should be fully offsetting all energy used in blockchain production with renewable resources – regardless of when or where those electrons are produced.\n\nSuccess is measured by the amount of NFT sales to users. As the community of users grows, greater awareness for Blockchain Power's mission and increase of capital for new development projects will result.\n\n• During the development stage, Blockchain Power anticipates allotting six months for development of its entire ecosystem, including the NFT and possibly the DEPWR token.\n\n• Once the ecosystem is operational, Blockchain aims to acquire at least ten corporate NFT purchasers and 100 individual purchasers.\n\n• After a year of being operational, Blockchain aims to acquire a minimum of twenty corporate NFT purchasers and 500 individual purchasers.\n\n-Depending on the success, we would deploy the proceeds directly to at least two high impact utility upgrades in communities that would otherwise have more solar energy (or sometimes any) solar energy providing power to the utility, individuals and businesses. \n\nWe've already consulted with attorneys on any needed legal structuring, and have approached approached several energy developers and asset owners about this idea and have received substantial amounts of excitement.  As such, we would have a public launch date of 12-15-21.\n\nThe requested budget is as follows:\n\n5,000 ADA equivalent for initial marketing of the platform, this will involve further outreach to asset owners, corporate sustainability directors and the wider blockchain community.\n\n5,000 ADA equivalent for legal expenses incurred for corporate and tax structuring.\n\n*10,000 ADA equivalent for consulting services related to minting the NFTs and making full use of the Smart Contracts deployment.  This is an area where I can use some additional technical assistance from the Cardano community. \n\nIt is important to note that we've already spent approximately 20,000 ADA of our own to initiate this project.  Additionally, we have familiarized ourselves with the transmission issues that are problematic (but obviously a great deal more study is needed).  For instance, A solar congestion analysis is currently underway to identify transmission congestion patterns in the SPP and MISO energy market for the 2026 study year in the United States. The utilizes models developed using PROMOD TAM™ which is licensed from Ventyx (ABB)™.  Using an hourly commitment and dispatch algorithm, various scenarios and study years are analyzed to provide forward looking LMPs, basis differentials to relevant trading hubs, generation dispatch, transmission flow and congestion. Hourly solutions are evaluated to determine the most economic system solution given generation, transmission and operational limitations. For this analysis, the SCED analysis includes an 8,760- hour evaluation of the 2026 study year.  2026 was chosen because that's how ridiculously long it takes for the utilities to respond and process applications.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367348-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nReal estate is an asset class that continues to prove itself as one of the most consequential investments and therefore agreements an individual will ever enter into in their lifetime.\n\nLending protocols are reliant on centralized, faith-based systems of due diligence when qualifying a buyer for a transaction.

With adoption and interest accelerating with every market cycle, NFTs promise to disrupt the real estate industry, but before peer to peer, transparent and law compliant real estate transactions can take place using blockchain technology, a solution like Artifact must be developed to represent the transaction data and real property records/rights as an NFT.\n\n \n\nuse cases include:\n\ncreate efficiencies by verifying and updating buyer's qualifications to purchase property in real time.\nincrease consumer/marketplace competency by encrypting fundamental property rights (variations of the legal definitions of \"possession, control, exclusion, enjoyment, and disposition\"\nincrease consumer/marketplace fidelity by encrypting the documents that connect the property owner to the property itself: deed, liens, chain of title, mortgage records, etc. \n  create transparency and increase identity by offering a decentralized method of publicly recording and verifying property owner's records/rights to reduce marketplace fraud\n  create efficiency for the future purpose of offering decentralized marketplace functions powered by NFTs for buying/selling/exchanging real property using smart contracts offering consumers more control over their property\n\n \n\n \n\nWho We Are:\n\nBlake McNeal- Real Estate Industry Stakeholder, Project Guide\n\n \n\nVincent Brandon - Blockchain, Technical Development Advisor\n\n \n\nMark Moore- Plutus Pioneer, Workflow Consultant\n\n \n\nHow Artifact NFTs operate:\n\nPhase 1: Buyer Side) Aligns seamlessly with traditional lending as well as DeFi lending protocols to mint \"proof of funds\" Artifact NFTs for Buyers in a real estate transaction. This product will increase transaction efficiency and transparency by using blockchain technology to verify and update financial due diligence in real time all without breaching personal privacy of the buyer. The Token won't need to harbor personal data to update and verify that the buyer meets the lender's minimum risk profile in real time because the \"proof of funds\" NFT will only broadcast the signal of the state of the relationship between buyer and lender.\n\n \n\n\"proof of funds\" Artifact NFT process:\n\nbuyer identifies property to buy\nbuyer works with lender to submit documents defining lender's due diligence (i.e. proof of buyer's income, proof of buyer's assets, proof of buyer's credit history, proof of buyer's identity)\nlender encrypts buyer data using Artifact and issues buyer \"proof of funds\" Artifact NFT that serves as a real time \"green light\" indicating a qualified state, helping qualified buyers compete in hyper competitive markets and helping sellers verify the most assured offers for their property.\nbuyer enters into contract with seller contingent on buyer's NFT remaining in qualification state\nTransaction closes\n\n \n\nPhase 1 (Buyer Side) Tech Development Goals:\n\nmilestone 1- Develop lender client facing application where \"proof of funds\" Artifact NFTs are minted\n\nmilestone 2- Develop smart contract capabilities that transparently verify status of buyer's financial ability to close deal\n\nmilestone 3- Develop public and private keys for updating lender due diligence records.\n\nmilestone 4- Audit security of smart contract and fluidity of data streams.\n\nmilestone 5- Commercially launch lender client facing application\n\n \n\nPhase 1 (Buyer Side) Operational Goals:\n\nmilestone 1- Voters elect to successfully fund Artifact from catalyst fund 6\n\nmilestone 2- Sign deal with commercial and residential mortgage lenders\n\nmilestone 3- Verify funds for 10,000 transactions by end of Q1 after launch\n\nmilestone 4- Raise subsequent funds for further product development and marketing\n\nmilestone 5- Verify funds for 100,000 transactions by end of Q1 after launch\n\nmilestone 6- Sign deal with commercial and residential mortgage lenders in every state of U.S. \n\n \n\n++Phase 2: Seller Side)++Aligns seamlessly with real estate escrow companies on the acquisition/disposition, origination, refinancing and entitlement of real property to encourage adoption by allowing the buyers and sellers to elect to encrypt, and therefore, represent their property records and rights onto the Cardano blockchain with \"bundle of rights\" Artifact NFT. This NFT will map the ownership structure in the real world onto the blockchain that will not only securely prove the property owner's entitlements but also give them a financial instrument that can be securitized, traded, tokenized or simply held to enhance appreciation of their asset while increasing resale value. Property owners can elect to mint their property's NFT at acquisition of property through title company client portal, or elect to mint at any time during ownership via title company client portal.\n\n \n\nHow are \"bundle of rights\" Artifact NFTs represented in the county clerk or public records office?\n\nIt is increasingly well known how NFT's are technically represented on the blockchain, but it's very obscure how they might technically be represented in legacy governance/market systems.\n\nWe are designing the \"bridge\" between the world of smart contracts/ledgers and the world of papers/files using consensual liens.\n\nUpon electing/consenting to mint an NFT for your real property, the NFT would be represented as a \"consensual lien.\" \n\nOn the blockchain, the \"bundle of rights\" Artifact NFT represents all legal abstractions of the unit of real property that connects the chain of title, financing records, ownership rights and current deed with the current ownership structure of that property.\n\nIn the local county clerk's office where property records are stored and verified, a consensual lien agreement will represent the NFT, meaning that the property cannot be sold or transferred to any other owner without the consensus of the lienholder(s) and/or the satisfaction of the terms of the lien (This right is fully realized when the property is unencumbered)\n\n \n\nPhase 2 (Seller Side) Tech Development Goals:\n\nmilestone 1- Develop escrow client facing application where \"bundle of rights\" Artifact NFTs are minted\n\nmilestone 2- integrate \"bundle of rights\" Artifact NFTs into a consumer facing wallet solution where \"bundle of rights\" Artifact NFTs will be stored\n\nmilestone 3- Build out user interface and polish front end development\n\nmilestone 4- Test backend development and audit security of consumer facing NFT custody system\n\nmilestone 5- Commercially launch escrow client facing application and consumer facing wallet integration\n\n \n\nPhase 2 (Seller Side) Operational Goals:\n\nmilestone 1- Voters elect to successfully fund Artifact from catalyst fund 6\n\nmilestone 2- Sign deal with our title company client that provides Artifact NFT minting to title offices in 21 states\n\nmilestone 3- Mint 3,000 Artifact NFTs by end of first quarter from launch\n\nmilestone 4- Raise subsequent funds for further product development and marketing\n\nmilestone 5- Mint 10,000+ Artifact NFTs by end of second quarter from launch\n\nmilestone 6- Sign deals with more title company clients that provide Artifact NFT minting to title offices in all 50 states\n\n*Relationship is in place with large nationally certified title company who is ready to become our first client for phase 2.\n\n \n\nThree Month Goalpost:\n\nComplete research, publish White Paper with code used to define NFT minting process and smart contract utilities for Phase 1 (Buyer Side)\n\nSix Month Goalpost:\n\nLaunch Phase 1 (Buyer Side)\n\nOne Year Goalpost:\n\nReach Milestone 6 of Phase 1 (Buyer Side) and launch Phase 2 (Seller Side)\n\n \n\nAllocation of Funds:\n\nBlockchain, Technical Development Advisor-$60/hr (5 hrs a week, one hour each weekday, $300/week, $3600 total) \n\nPlutus Pioneer, Workflow Consultant- $60/hr (5hrs a week, one hour each weekday, $300/week, $3600 total)\n\nBlockchain Developer- $33.33/hr 25hrs a week, $3,333/month for 2 months\n\nFullstack Developer- $20.85/hr, 20hrs a week, $1,666/month for 2 months\n\nMarketing/Float- $2,800 (advertising to meet with traditional lending as well as DeFi lending companies to gain business relationship)\n\n \n\nConclusion: When the methods of verifying Buyer qualifications and representing Lender due diligence are decentralized and rolled-up via NFT coupled with decentralized methods that verify Seller property records and rights are rolled up via NFT, a real estate marketplace powered by NFTs can function and be exposed to the innate creativity and value inherent in healthy market ecosystems like Cardano.\n\n \n\nLaunch Phase 1: January 1, 2022","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367363-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nOverview\n\nProposals after the finalized stage or also after being funded currently lack the ability to be kept up to date with relevant content about the proposal such as interviews, podcasts, articles, demos and any other relevant media content. Both proposers themselves or the community should be able to suggest content that should be added to the proposal data so it is easy for the community to understand everything going on for a given proposal - especially those that have been funded!\n\nThis proposal is a follow on from the following fund 5 proposals - improve proposal data https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The enriched proposal data from these fund 5 proposals will be made available in an open source repository that anyone can fork and consume for their own projects. This proposal media content proposal will build on top of that data set and produce more data for that repository that will be updated through the https://projectcatalyst.org community site.\n\nThis proposal helps meet the challenge of improving auditability of funded proposals by providing a way for both proposers and the community to add more content based information about a funded proposal. The more information that the community has relevant to each funded proposal the more efficient and transparent it is to the community to understand the impact of a proposal for its return on intention. The data will also be completely open source helping it to become more distributed in the community and allow for it to be more easily used in other contexts such as analysis on the effectiveness of proposals.\n\n \n\nDesign \n\nCheck the attachments for a design mockup. This design is just to give an idea of what it could look like though please note this may change a bit when it gets implemented!\n\n \n\nDevelopment steps\n\n- Add a media linking form to the proposal pages so that a proposer or trusted community member can link to any media content that is relevant to a given proposal.\n\n- Present the media content on all the proposal pages so the community can view the media with the other relevant information.\n\n- Take existing data for attachments from Ideascale to attach them to the historical proposals so that proposals have the historical media content data.\n\n- Implement the adding the media content data to the open source proposal data repository so everyone gets access to media content for any proposal.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nGetting existing proposal information into an open source repository will the pre-requisite to this proposal which involves completing fund 5 funded proposals for improving proposal information https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 Creating a data model for the media with the functionality should take around 3 weeks to complete however there is also manual work in bringing together historical data of attachments in Ideascale and other relevant media to previous proposals that will enrich the previously funded proposal data. This manual work will be fairly time consuming and likely take around 3 weeks to complete. In total the proposal will likely take around 6 weeks to complete.\n\n- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.\n\n- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.\n\n- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed\n\n \n\nFeasibility\n\n- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps & Darlington has 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Between us we covers the skills needed to draft out a sensible data model, make it easy to gather new data and host that in a public API for the community.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\n- More up to date information - By providing a better process to keep media information up to date for a given proposal the community will be better informed on the progress or relevant information about what is happening.\n\n- Inform future voting - Better media coverage of what is happening should help to inform future voting where the community can more easily audit interviews, demos or similar media content to gage the impact they are having in the ecosystem.\n\n \n\nAuditability\n\n- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.\n\n- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst\n\n- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e\n\n- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\n \n\nSuccess metrics\n\n- Increasing the number of people viewing proposals - Tracking the traffic to proposal pages will give insight into the engagement of the community for a given proposal and whether they are viewing the media relevant to each proposal.\n\n- Increasing the amount of proposal information coverage - Providing an easy way to attach relevant media to a proposal should help encourage people both working on the proposal team and also community members in the ecosystem to help link more relevant media content that will help with the auditing process.\n\n \n\nWhat success looks like\n\nThe success of this proposal will mean providing an effortless way for proposers or trusted community members to be able to enrich a proposal with more media content as it becomes available. With that functionality the secondary thing is how that impacts the communities engagement with the proposals and use the extra proposal data to enrich their own tools or for analysis for auditing.\n\n \n\nBudget\n\n- Time required: 6 weeks = 40 hours x 6 = 240\n\n- Time allocation: Research & analysis (10%), Product and design (10%), Data handling (25%) Development (40%), Maintenance (5%), Collaboration (5%)\n\n- Budget = 240 x $55 per hour = $13,200\n\n- Hosting & Software = $500\n\nTotal: $13,700\n\n \n\nPartnerships\n\nWe've partnered with Lidonation https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Treasury-Catalyst-Directory/366965-48088 to help with our existing fund 5 proposals about proposal data (Improving proposal information and project tracking), our fund 6 proposals about auditability and also for their own proposal that will help with improving the access to Catalyst data through a public production ready API.\n\n- Darlington - 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps.

We are so grateful to the community and thrilled to be allowed to move forward. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\n\n-\n\nAs you might imagine, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since the start of this adventure and a lot of new ideas and questions; challenges and also opportunities, emerged along the way. We have learned a lot since the last months and realized we have so much more to learn. But we are more eager than ever to keep pushing the development of this exciting new space.\n\n-\n\nAnd now, great news: the initial phase, Phase 1, whose costs are covered by the reward from Fund5, is almost completed already! You can see the progress right here on Github: https://github.com/lokdao/igivit or https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSDBbRthkcaFy31D7jQCGmtDB1MPClfjx1gETiOu65BAamjWGpjusClXkgenacoxF3twa1NVN55j2TH/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=3000 \n\nOur current state is a Figma prototype with no back-end yet. We are currently finalizing the colour schemes and so on. On Github, at this moment, we present black and white wireframes. New visuals to land soon, keep coming back!\n\n-\n\nIt is now time to move forward with Phase 2; the object of this Fund6 proposal. In the upcoming phase, we will be aiming at transforming the Figma High-Fidelity Demo into a functioning website, with a standard database, but without the blockchain component integrated yet.\n\nThere will also be improvements to functionalities and features from the current demo wireframes.\n\nThen we will be moving to Phase 3: where we will formally integrate within the Cardano blockchain as we have within our team our own Plutus Pioneer!\n\nWe also imagine integrating Atala Prism to our solution for everything related to identity validation.\n\n_\n\nRoadmap:\n\nHere's an overview of the road ahead. Everyone will be able to follow the progress of the build on both our website (https://igivit.org), Github repository (https://github.com/lokdao/igivit) - right now filled with prototype images - and on our progress page (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wwbmTMB4dD3iUBr_gi_ygnFyannIAtXTJEdufRS0Vyo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nPhase 1 - Proof of Concept - April to September 2021 (in progress):\n\n- High-Fidelity prototype (Figma) = Almost completed!\n\nWith Project Catalyst Fund5, we will be receiving a payment that will be used to reimburse those costs.\n\nAgain we want to say thank you to the participating members of the Cardano community for voting for us and, in a more general sense, for taking part in this pioneering governance system! :)\n\nYou can find the link to our expenses paid so far.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tiyfae2rGYZz20KWsiGCmh6zeSEqWE60LO8JtaeR0OU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAs a refresher, you can find our Fund5 Budget here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YEvq2PSJSYc822zXRu67lSVUVbsB2K9M-WkwXBuAWcc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFinally, you can find info on our progress along with images of our prototype here;\n\nhttps://igivit.org/progress-page-igivit/\n\n \n\nPhase 2 - Adding functionality - Q4 2021 (to start in earnest if we get funded !)\n\n- Convert the Figma prototype into a functioning Proof of Concept (PoC); a web platform where each of the 7 user personas required can interact in a campaign. Limited to core functionalities at first, with the backend database but no blockchain integration yet.\n\nOnce completed, Phase 2 will deliver a functional PoC featuring the core pages that can then be used to demonstrate the value proposition and attract investors and potential partners\n\nPhase 3 - The Alonzo Era - Q1 2022\n\n- Complete conversion of the remaining prototype pages for the entire platform\n\n- Integrate the application with the Cardano blockchain, via the development of smart contracts using Plutus\n\n- Demo the PoC to advisors and the community\n\n \n\nPhase 4 - Improvements, QA and Atala Prism Integration - Q2 2022\n\n- Make modifications following comments\n\n- Make UX/UI advanced design\n\n- Perform Quality Assurance (QA)\n\n- Integrate with Atala Prism for decentralized identity (to be confirmed)\n\n \n\nPhase 5 - Charity Integration - Q3 2022\n\n- Integrate within a charity organisation; create a campaign\n\n \n\nPhase 6 - Hello World - Q4 2022\n\n- Go Live: launch the first real-world campaign\n\n___\n\nMeasures of success:\n\n3 months - December 2021: Complete programming of the core pages for all 7 User Personas on a basic website with backend database but no blockchain connection yet.\n\n6 months - March 2022: Start attaching the platform data to the Cardano blockchain\n\n12 months - September 2022: The IGIVIT platform is on the verge of launching its first Live campaign.\n\n___\n\nThe team:\n\nDavid Poulin or @mrvaralta (https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-poulin/) used to be a Creative Director for Cirque du Soleil and other entertainment companies. Being a crypto enthusiast and a Cardano fan, the pandemic pushed him to write down the initial idea for IGIVIT in a white paper and to design paper-prototypes (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bD-l9eQOUmiRrg_eE2SFA4Rk9OCh2Gc?usp=sharing). Even though he's not from the dev world, he has a very good understanding of this emerging technology and the new possibilities it can offer to the world.\n\nLudovic Grandclement or @gildor (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludovicgrandclement/) is an experienced Project Manager and Data Engineer. What's more: he was part of the Plutus Pioneer Program's first cohort and completed it (you can check out his NFT certification - https://pool.pm/d068fe47123ec4c86460eeb74c7d7765c67d2df295a3ac86d664ed45.PlutusFirstClassPhoto50).\n\nThe two joined forces during the Fund3 proposal process.\n\n___\n\nBudget:\n\nNow, in order to accomplish this, we will need funds. This is why we are asking for 57,440.00$ USD.\n\nHow are we going to spend this money? You can find our detailed budget right here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aGPOVyPBh-RtTWHD5gKJ8EjWOmUV6s2NWJqOiKwemZ0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWe calculated this amount based on fair estimations of the time needed to program this, of course, but also with a portion looking towards the future; to allow for the development of the core functionalities; the core concept and its business development.\n\n-\n\nSo that's it, this is us; this is the idea behind IGIVIT. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. If you believe that we can achieve our goal, we would be humbled and honoured to be the recipient of your vote during this funding round.\n\nIn any case, please leave us a comment or a question down below in the Comments section so we can hear from you and grow the solution with your added insights.\n\n__________\n\nIGIVIT Original Proposal Text:\n\nOverview:\n\nWe are looking to build the donation platform of tomorrow. In essence, we seek to finance the creation of a new way of giving to charities by building an app that will ease the donation process, help manage campaigns and transparently display all data on the blockchain: it's called IGIVIT.\n\nWith IGIVIT, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing the tools to deliver financial assistance and/or emergency relief to the people and communities in need. We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized app allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.\n\nCurrently, when giving to a charity, it is very hard to know how the funds are really being used. This opacity in the donation process prevents a lot of people from making contributions. Now, imagine being able to know exactly, and with absolute certainty, how your donation is making a difference in the real world.\n\nWith IGIVIT, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing financial assistance and/or emergency relief to the people and communities in need. We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized application allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.\n\n___\n\nEnd-user value:\n\nOnce fully deployed, IGIVIT will help in more than one way:\n\n- Bring back integrity, transparency and accountability into the donation process and;\n\n- Become a leading donation platform in the philanthropic space; where charities and other organizations will be running all their campaigns on our solution.\n\nWe strongly believe that IGIVIT is a great use-case for the adoption of blockchain and its underlying Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). By being very easy to use and by giving the ability to witness, in real-time and with 100% certainty, how the donations are used, IGIVIT will be a great tool to demonstrate the true wonders of the technology.\n\nIn time, the general public will realize that blockchain-based organizations offer so much more than regular charities that the balance of donated wealth will start to shift.\n\nWhat's more, IGIVIT will provide a thorough search engine that will allow you to find new charities to give to, even if they're not blockchain-based. For those latter ones, IGIVIT will automatically forward the donation to the charity's account (minus minuscule processing fees). If the organization is not showing in the search results, it can be added very easily by the user itself.\n\n___\n\nUsage:\n\nHere are two examples of the main features the platform can be used for in order to improve the donation process:\n\nFinancial aid\n\n- This is the most simple example. If the end-goal is to give money then the funds get transferred to the wallet of the person in need, for them to spend as they please. Every transaction is displayed transparently on the blockchain. There is no need for an auditor.\n\nEmergency relief\n\n- If the goal is, for example, to feed villagers, then every step of the process will be displayed on the blockchain. For this to be validated with great certainty and to avoid fraudulent claims, a 3rd party Auditor will need to assess and approve the various steps involved.\n\n___\n\nChallenges and Roadblocks:\n\nMany challenges and roadblocks exist on our path to successfully reach our goal. Here's a brief description of some of them, in no particular order.\n\nChallenge 1 - Fraudulent/Untruthful ledger entries or claims\n\nTo deliver funds to a person in need is relatively straightforward as we can easily verify the transfer of values on the blockchain as long as we have proof of their true identities (we are looking at implementing Atala Prism for this portion of the challenge).\n\nHowever, when trying to deliver physical help in the field (building shelters, serving food, etc) it is much more difficult to prove that non-digital actions really took place. To overcome this challenge, we are implementing a multi-signature process where both the Organization's campaign manager and an independent Auditor need to confirm the truthfulness of the action item being forever written on the blockchain.\n\nChallenge 2 - Partial Centralization\n\nSome level of centralization will unfortunately need to be present in order for a charity to manage their own campaigns. But we believe that the transparency of the blockchain coupled with the aforementioned Auditor process, will bring enough accountability into the system for the general public to get a heightened sense of trust towards the whole process.\n\nChallenge 3 - Large endeavour\n\nOur project is not small. There is a lot that needs to be accomplished and it has lots of potential ramifications that we are not aware of. We are then taking it one baby step at a time. Building the house brick by brick instead of throwing a tarp over some branches. That's why we are splitting the work in distinct phases.\n\nChallenge 4 - Reliance on sub-contracted dev teams\n\nWe want to be 100% transparent regarding our capabilities. Our core team is not made of pure coders. In order for us to succeed in creating this ambitious project, we sub-contracted a dedicated dev team that will enable us to demonstrate to the world the possibilities offered by IGIVIT.\n\nChallenge 5 - Legal monetary issues (doing philanthropy in all regions of the world)\n\nRight now, questions arise about the legality of using cryptocurrency to deliver humanitarian aid to any parts of the world. This challenge is currently being addressed within our team as an on-going research. The solution will emerge in a later phase of the project.\n\nOne thing is for sure, in order to secure the value of the donated money, the use of a stable coin is inevitable.\n\nChallenge 6 - Identity proof\n\nOne major challenge is to get absolute proof of the identities of the people and organizations taking part in our ecosystem. As we mentioned before, in order to be able to trust that help is really being carried out to the right people, a decentralized identity system needs to be used. All parties involved are then becoming owners of their own information; their own identities. Again, Atala Prism is so far the best example of such a system that could potentially be integrated into IGIVIT once we deploy on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nOne added benefit is that, while providing humanitarian help, it also provides greater freedom and possibilities to the affected people and their local communities through identity ownership.\n\nChallenge 7 - Adoption by organizations\n\nOf course, some organizations might not want to open their books so wide and so transparently to the world. They might prefer to remain opaque in order to keep more money for other things than helping the needy. Our vision is that, over time, the donors to these charities will switch to IGIVIT for a better way of giving. The opaque organizations might find themselves forced to adopt blockchain in order to remain relevant.\n\nChallenge 8 - Blockchain choice\n\nEven though we will be building the PoC with backend logic only first in order to get a working prototype faster, meaning without any blockchain, inevitably we are going to migrate to the only blockchain worth building on: Cardano. Our legendary 3rd generation protocol is the perfect backbone for our entire system because it is built the right way; because it is built for centuries. But we are preaching to the choir…\n\nBuilding our solution in two separate steps will create a layer of complexity to the process as we will need to find time and resources to do the switch. But we believe the advantages outweigh the drawbacks so that's why we are moving forward with this plan.\n\nChallenge 9 - Competition\n\nRight now, there are very few places to donate where blockchain is used to guarantee and show the usage of said funds. The biggest one being Binance Charity (https://www.binance.charity/) . Even though it is one of the biggest crypto exchange in the world, the reach of its campaigns and the thoroughness of what is available to monitor seems pretty limited and we believe this is where our solution will shine.\n\n___\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith IGIVIT, members of the general public will finally be able to see with their own eyes how their money is really being used, what actions have been taken, who received the intended help, all in fine detail. This emerging blockchain technology will then be used to create real improvements for real people; real changes in the real world.\n\nBy tackling challenges of the 3rd sector (philanthropy) head-on, we believe that one day, IGIVIT will become the reference in money donations.\n\nThanks:\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read our proposal.

Customer Development and Recruiting:  (2 months)\n\nAs we start, we communicate with the Agriculture Transformation Agency (ATA), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and small and medium enterprises and farmers. Introduce our project and understand the details in their problem set, cultivate their understanding of what a blockchain-powered application can do. \n\nParallelly, we build efficient team dynamics. We would hire experts needed to build the platform fully engineered as well as sustaining our project as a thriving business. \n\nMake some effort to understand how they want our solution to fill the gaps in their business by showing the prospects our MVP to give some idea of the solution.\n\nHaving the two intact, once we get an agreement from enough prospects, we will proceed to develop the full solution considering their preferences and efficiency.\n\nHiring experts starts here and continues as a state of road map requires and affords it.\n\n \n\n2.

Adoption: (4 months)\n\nWe make strategic partnerships with entities including prospective clients to adopt and promote our services along with their own services. We would also give an extended free trial period to use our platform and in return, they will promote it appended to their own regular promotion. \n\nCommissioned salesmen and women will be employed.\n\nUsing the appropriate marketing channel, we spread the news about the value/service we provide to our customer segments\n\n \n\n4. Scaling: (4 months)\n\nAt this stage, maybe in the next round of repeating this cycle, we would raise investment funds from promising investment organizations/groups such as this to support expenses for scaling our service. Scaling up will require us more budget for expanding technical utilities like servers, human resources for the new scope of the project, marketing expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses.\n\n \n\n5. Sustaining and product improvement (Continous)\n\nSustaining the project as a full profit organization thriving in the space providing values to the stakeholders in the sector and the general economic aspect of the East-African region and the Middle east.\n\n \n\nThe Opportunities:\n\nThe primary target customers will be small and medium enterprises\n\nPerfect timing: Kenya-Ethiopia trade agreement is at a fresh start, Cardano has made an agreement with the Ethiopian government, and huge encouragement innovative solutions for agriculture and agriculture is one of the major development focus currently. First comer advantage is also undeniably important.\nImmense demand: Export items including apiculture products have a plethora of demand for the item and the item's history traceability in search of certainty on the quality of the products.\nAccessibility of stakeholders: we have enough connections to the producers, others through Minstry of Agriculture. \nClarity of problem domain: we have a clear view of the issues\nSupportive Environment: small and medium enterprises are open to cheaper and tech solutions\n\nThe Risks and Challenge:\n\nOne challenge is finding a good Plutus smart contract developer and NFT marketplace developer on a budget. Although it's not as difficult if we get help from the Cardano community.\nFortunately enough, risks in the space are quite a few and at the minimum level, most likely not to happen.\n\nSuccess Measurements:\n\nIn general, success would be measured by the progress according to the milestones. Specific measuring points are:\n\nMaking key partnership\nMeeting project milestones\nMeeting client expectation\nGood user experience\nADA payment option being well used\nReturn on investment a year after Adoption stage (3rd on the road map)\nSelf-sustaining\nEarly-stage adoption from the land administration office of Addis Ababa, private real estate owners, and end-users.\nCustomers actually gaining the proposed value\nThe project becomes self-sufficient after securing two clients.\nEnabling services for water and electricity based on clients openness\nStart scaling up to the international market after 18 months of successful adoption of the local market\n\n \n\nBudget plan:\n\nMost of the budget will go to salaries of experts helping to realize the project, here is the plan:\n\n  Three months budget:\n\nLegal consultant or Attorney: $2,500 for 3 months (it may not necessarily be sequential months)\nQuality Assurance officer: $3,000 for three months \n\nSix months budget:\n\nPlutus Smart Contract Developer: $12,000 for 4 months.\nDevOps Engineer: $3,200 for 4 months\nBack-end Engineer: $4,000 for 4 months\nFront-end Engineer: $3,200 for 4 months \nTelegram bot dev: $300 one time pay\nBusiness consultant: $2,500 for 6 months\n\n12 months budget:\n\nCustomer Service Officers: $8,500 for 12 months\nProject Manager and Team leader: $24,000 for 12 months\nCloud services: AWS Graviton2-based EC2 instances; p2.xlage($0.9/hr) = $7884 for 12 months\nInternet connection: $3,000 for 12 months\nMarketing: $2,000 for 12 months\nAccountant: $3,600 for 12 months \nOffice rent: $2000 for 12 months (Temporary co-working space rent, until we start generating income) \nMiscellaneous expenses for some minor affairs in relation to this project: $2,126 for 12 months.\n\nThe total budget to pull the project to mass scaling to greater market size is 83,810 USD.\n\nWe ask for 57,356****USD funds from Cardano to be able to build the product, the team dynamics, get a business license and the customers, and secure a minimum of three clients.\n\nWe have plans to raise the remaining 26,454 USD funds later on after establishing the project as a running business, at the scaling stage from other options like Venture Capitals and investment groups. \n\n \n\nThe Team:\n\nMearaf Tadewos: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mearaf-tadewos-634228174/\n\nNathan Samson: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-samson-419349135/\n\nNebiyu Sultan:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/nebiyu-sultan-30775446/\n\n \n\nThis blockchain-powered Supply-chain project is inspired by the issues I find in my community issues with edible items price inflation, and several merchants complaints.\n\nAnother major problem observed is emerging small/middle size growing enterprises struggling with demand of tracability and trustablity of their products in the international market and my own experience. For instance their is a big demand of honey from Germany in Ethiopia but some of the hone producer I know are loosing the opportunity because they can't provide traceability. Similar issue is experienced in other growing producers.\n\nI obtained these problem observations through the exposure I have got while I was working to establish an agri-tech startup at iceaddis, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nThere will be great value in solving the supply chain problem while using Cardano's blockchain and ADA itself.\n\n \n\nP.S. While writing my proposal, I kept in mind that fashioning this project to become a win-win for our clients, the end-users (clients of our clients), and for Cardano simultaneously, What are the 5 key things that would define the project's success in short and long terms, milestones, estimating a budget for each milestone, which experts to hire and where to find them, how to find and approach prospective clients and understanding their point of view, and way to run the project as a self-sustaining business.\n\nLet's grow Africa, and grow Cardano.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367244-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nOverview\n\nUnderstanding the risk posture for organizations, systems and applications is critical in developing mitigation strategies, managing the risk tolerance, and communicating security plans.\n\nBeyond the message of how to remediate a risk finding, it is also important to easily and properly score and report through a framework that is consistent and well known to the community at large.\n\nWe propose a Risk Profile for Cardano stakepool operators who manage individual nodes across the network. The risk profile would be a streamlined process with several stages. The audit will build upon standards developed by the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and the International Standards Organization (ISO). We will work closely with the SPOCRA community of stakepool operators to identify the key security vulnerabilities, complete audits of a wide group of stakepool operators, and to disseminate the proposed surveys.\n\nThe first stage which is the focus of this proposal will address the inherent risk profile. This will be an easy-to-follow psychometric evaluation of the key areas of risk defined by the model. It is a self-assessment that provides an initial risk profile based on the stakeholder's own responses to allow the framework to easily score and point out weak areas of risk and concern within the system.\n\nA companion proposal, Cardano Risk Control System, submitted to the F6 Disaster: When all is a Stake challenge is a six-month project focused on the second phase of validation of the self-audits. A third phase, focused on modeling risk management scenarios, will be proposed during Fund 7.\n\nProposed Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)\n\nBuilding and developing the approach for a Risk Profile will require the implementation of an application that will easily integrate into a great community of risk, for which the risk profile can be one of the variables in contributing to the overall risk catalog for the stakeholders's unit under management.\n\nTo accomplish this we propose the following objectives and key results:\n\n1. Integrate Cardano Stakepools onto the NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool\n\n    a. 5 major and 10 minor security indicators have been identified for stakepool operation\n\n    b. 2 stakepool operators have validated the operation of the website integration\n\n2. Develop templates for independent Stakepool node assessment\n\n    a. 10 assessment questions have been composed and validated for the survey\n\n    b. 10 stakepool operators have been identified to participate in the initial survey\n\n3. Reporting engine for stakepool operators to publish current findings on the Stakepool Node assessments\n\n    a. 2 stakepool operators have contributed to the development of the reporting engine\n\n    b. 5 stakepool operators have published survey results with the SPOCRA community\n\nSchedule\n\nNov 2021 - Integrate NOXMON Stakepool tool\n\n   Lead: Alexander Miranda\n\n   Support Staff: Nelson, Stiglics, Span, Web Developer\n\n   Staff Budget: $12,065\n\n   Computer Supplies: $1,268\n\nDec 2021 - Templates for Stakepool assessment\n\n   Lead: Lauris Stiglics\n\n   Support Staff: Miranda, Nelson, Span, Web Developer\n\n   Staff Budget: $12,782\n\n   Survey Supplies: $551\n\nJan 2021 - Reporting engine\n\n   Lead: Nelson\n\n   Support Staff: Miranda, Stiglics, Span, Web Developer\n\n   Staff Budget: $13,334\n\n \n\nSix Month Milestone: Propose and Complete Phase II Control System\n\nTwelve Month Milestone: Propose and Complete Phase III Risk Analysis of Cardano Stakepools \n\nReferences\n\nA.

Events such as deforestation and other land-use changes, which have a great influence on environmental footprint, will be tracked and linked to the specific crop that was produced within the automatically detected field boundaries.\n\nthat information, together with the collection of data for tracking of transactions of food items along the value chain, will be linked into the Cardano infrastructure. To overcome the complexity generated by the multitude of individual stakeholders each possessing a piece of the supply information, the blockchain represents an innovative and efficient answer to link all those data in one central ledger. This will enable the consolidation of all information for traceability and transparency of the food value chain in an open data and trustworthy way. After the integration and control of those data, the environmental footprint of the product will be calculated using innovative gap filling and data modeling techniques.\n\nMotivation\n\nThere is an urgent need to transform our food system in order to tackle climate change. Food consumption is contributing to about 30% of the world's household's GHG emissions, as well as it is at the heart of keeping within other planetary boundaries. As a society, we need to change our food behaviors towards products with lower environmental impact. This change can only be obtained by bringing transparency on the real environmental impact of every food product to the surface, to give all actors along the supply chain – from farm to fork - the means to make better decisions.\n\nSmallholder farmers\n\nWe create the incentive to get their story and efforts recognized. As participants, they will be provided with meaningful insights to optimize their farming patterns. Any contribution towards optimizing yields and improving patterns for sustainable fair trade, that is beyond their own capacity, they can directly ask consumers for support.\n\nSupply chain\n\nThe project will provide food producers and retailers with a service to obtain trustworthy and detailed environmental footprint calculations of their products as well as the possibility to refine and improve their production environmental impact calculation by integrating their privately owned data. The service will enable them to get a deeper understanding of where to act to improve their product's footprint, as well as the opportunity to visually display the product footprint through logo on pack and be used for marketing purposes.\n\n \n\nTime schedule\n\nFirst 3 months:\n\nCrop information and field boundaries are mapped out via satellite images and neural networks. (Hummingbird)\n\nAfter 6 months:\n\nThrough the communication of environmental impacts (modeled CO₂ calculations for millions) of food products based on the available information on the stock control unit (SKU), we incentive players along the supply chain to participate in data collection efforts linking crops towards the end products. (Eaternity)\n\nAfter 12 months:\n\nEach data contribution is profiled and fits into a scientific framework contributing to higher quality consumer information for the product. (Hestia)\n\nAll the data is linked into the blockchain in connection with the ongoing efforts in Atala Prism and Trace. Allowing farmers to receive an ID and claim their agricultural land via a simple and user-friendly interface.\n\n \n\nPublic Launch Date:\n\nOctober 2022\n\nLater:\n\nAt a later stage consumers (of the various production stages), will be able to contribute funds towards the smallholder farmers through voluntary donations, or contractual agreements. For example, an end consumer wants to support the farmer's effort to reduce carbon emissions by using solar panels and directly through the identification provided on the SKU channels donations towards the farmer.\n\n \n\nUnderlying features to be developed to accomplish this project:\n\nDispute System: Each information introduced to the supply chain needs to be regarded as a not-certain, and stay open to dispute. Hence each information introduced is staked and can be challenged via an oracle so that the verification of the information is converted into a digital asset. For example, farmers claim their field at the point in time of registering through their wallet, and hence it is linked to their personal identity. Each other participant who claims to know different can dispute the fact and third actors and verifications schemes (e.g. governmental agencies) can resolve it.\n\nPrivate-public hybrid: The framework allows to introduce data that is not completely public, but only accessible to specific actors. For example access to information about production details that should only be used for the impact calculations (e.g. the amount of fertilizer used) is only granted to the impact calculation engine. All data is nevertheless hashed and committed as such to the public blockchain. The container storage and private data access could be handled with content encryption and IPFS hybrid-private networks.\n\nCascading Identities: To recover and verify identities we introduce a smart Plutus contract, that allows each actor to associate their wallet with other trusted central institutions or persons, for the sake of 1) verifying my identity and 2) to recover funds and identity given the circumstance of lost credentials. These trusted parties will never have access to the private key of the wallet and are only allowed to intervene by the conditions set by the user of the original wallet.\n\nDirect Access Product Scores: For each stock control unit (or SKU; basically any product on a retail market shelf) a unique identity and public URL will always link to the latest and most up-to-date impact assessment result. A simple static website with javascript will query the blockchain and pull the latest information for the display of the product and its environmental ratings.\n\n \n\nRemark:\n\nThe organizations will already contribute about 1.5m € towards this project in December 2021. We are looking for additional funds and partners.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367514-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nStage 1: We have developed a tool that allows users to upload their asset on two blockchain systems:\n\n Firstly, customers can upload a certain file, we will store it on IPFS system. IPFS is a Blockchain network for file storage, each content of a file will produce a corresponding unique hash code.\n\n Then, customers can add metadata to their assets such as: Description; Copyright…\n\n Finally, customers can update to the Cardano blockchain, we will exploit assets into NFT with the amount desired by the customers, and then send the assets back to the customer's wallet.\n\nSince we are not able to connect to plugin wallet on the browser at the moment, we will exploit NFT on our wallet and then send it back to the customers. In the future, when there is a smart contract on the Cardano Blockchain network, we will exploit directly on the browser's plugin wallet.\n\nStage 2: After many customers have turned their assets into NFTs on Cardano, we will continue to develop an exchange that allows these NFTs to be bought and sold. At that time, when you visit our website, we can connect to your wallet and see what assets in that wallet? And what assets are you going to sell? What is the selling price to put on the exchange and advertise to everyone. We will collect a amount of fees on each transaction\n\nStage 3: We will develop Functions that allow manufacturers to put their products on the Cardano system in the form of NFT to trace the origin. For examples: An enterprise can generate an NFT code for each pig to be sold; That enterprise sells the pig to another enterprise, that enterprise will divide the pig into pieces and we'll generate new NFT codes for each piece of meat that are linked to the initial pig's NFT code. From there, buyers at each supermarket will check the meat they intend to buy through which companies, how it is raised and where it is currently being sold.\n\nYou can see more detail:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-d4PUiuA3uJcrWMnuC9FW5UU637Pw1D4?usp=sharing","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367545-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe plan is, each day I write and publish pages, I offer them to supporters who pledge their Ada to the stake pool (Books4Blocks is a name idea), where the literature is offered for free to stake pool supporters.\n\nThese pages address current issues -- and focus primarily on self-liberation, and healing of the soul. What's needed daily.\n\nBooks get written, blocks get saturated, a gallery of NFT art is generated exclusive to Cardano Net, and pages are offered daily. All dedicated to the Mainnnet nodes we saturate as a community.\n\nIn effect we build the New Library of Alexandria that will never be burned down. And it shall contain great wisdom.\n\nIf folks want to purchase either full books or pages individually, I am not opposed to auctions starting at 1 ADA. And so we get an auctions system and gallery going for the sale of NFTs. Any pages I sell that sell for more than 10 Ada I shall by request mail and ship the original typewritten pages won, so members of the community can own the original. Not the rights to copyright work, mind you, but the rights to own the original digital print as well as the physical page. As an original art piece. And that is how I will receive compensation for my service. The rest of the work I provide for free. And it's valuable.\n\nMy requested funds are to recover the costs of the scanning software I use which is Kofax OmniPage ($499) and my digital scanner ($100). I am fine with access to the gallery being managed by community vote. This will require collaborative effort. That's what I'm asking for more than anything here. I am not a programmer. It seems to be perceived as a weakness, and a gatekeeper.  I offer a valuable, alternative perspective. I am a writer who believes in Cardano enough to bring several friends and family aboard the train. I want to share my writing, music and film with this community. I want to collaborate with other creatives who are willing to take a leap of faith with me. There is no outlet for writers, musicians or filmmakers from what I can see through Cardano. There is no forum. So tell me what I have to do to create a hub for readers, filmmakers, musicians, writers and poets.\n\nWithout this, there is a major element missing and this creative element can and will drive the expansion of the Cardano community. I want in. I don't know how else to ask for it. I've been asking for help with this for months. Written Charles directly. Literature is life. Yet no one is reading. Perhaps you want audiobooks? No problem, I can do that too.\n\nIf there was no written word, there would be no lambda calculus and that means there would be no programming languages. No Cardano. No blockchain. No Ada Lovelace writing the first programming code. No civilization.\n\nI'm asking for you to support a dying craft by immortalizing it. That's what this community is about. That's what I believe. Now someone please be courageous and come forward and work with me. Someone who can handle the backend and turn a jpeg into an NFT. For starters. And then an .mp3. And then a .mp4. Then pdf and word docs. All NFTs. That's what the artists need.\n\nWe must start building a compendium of artistic expression to fuel our hearts and souls and keep us going. And celebrate it.\n\nIf I'm missing where this forum exists where folks are cranking out NFTs and selling them like hotcakes to eager artist supporters, I want in. But I want it to be as easy as maintaining a Substack blog. Something turn-key where creatives can write, compose, create, and post as NFT. No more run arounds, Artists need to get involved if you want fuel.\n\nThe first alt-coin to do this is going to have a head start on the rest.\n\nJeff Bezos was one of the first, and most determined to accomplish this with books on the Internet. He believed. Now someone must take the lead with this on blockchain. I'll supply a ton of literature to get us started.

Our goal is to improve the usability of this community-focused tool by adding an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow third-party organizations and services to curate and consume the portfolios. By providing this service, we will effectively connect delegators to the pools that support the causes and projects that are important to them, thereby strengthening both the network and the community.\n\nThe upgrade will consist of two thrusts:\n\n1.

However, smart contract developers need access to *trustworthy* information external to the blockchain to serve as inputs to their application logic. For example, a change in the BTC/ADA price may trigger a limit order on a DeFi platform, the final score in a soccer match may trigger a payout in a betting Dapp, or an extreme weather event may trigger a crop insurance claim.\n\nOracles are the blockchain primitives that provide this real-world information to on-chain smart contracts. The data they provide must be authentic as it will have significant financial consequences. However, there is a risk that the critical role of oracles in the Cardano smart contract ecosystem will be overlooked or downplayed in face of the (justified) Goguen era hype and the flurry of pre-launch project announcements.\n\nThe small crop of existing oracle solutions, such as the Ethereum big fish Chainlink, do a good job articulating the \"oracle problem\" but when you dig deeper you see that they often conflate information security with information provenance. If you look past the slick ICO marketing and whitepapers you are really being asked to trust their technical decisions and collaborators rather than an open specification and easy-to-audit architectures. Even with sound security protocols, the opportunities for manipulating oracle information somewhere in their provenance pipelines remain ripe without the solution being proposed by the Orcfax project.\n\nOur solution:\n\nA standards-based specification and open source software that *explicitly* expose and archive the flow of information from real-world data sources (e.g. APIs, open datasets, reports), through oracle architecture stacks, and onto the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThe project is called \"Orcfax\" as a play on words combining \"oracle\" and \"facts.\" A Cardano-branded orca is our logo.\n\nWe will publish the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification and develop an open-source, Cardano-native reference implementation. This software will act as a pragmatic proof-of-concept for the specification as well as provide Cardano developers and oracle providers with a free and open source tool to deploy their own Orcfax-based solution.\n\nTo draft the specification we will assess and apply proven industry standards that were developed over many years of open collaboration by communities of domain experts. These include:\n\nW3C PROV-O: the definitive specification for expressing information provenance. See https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/\nW3C Verifiable Claims: the definitive specification for third-party verification of online information. https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/\nISO 17068: the definitive specification for maintaining trustworthy repositories of authentic information. See https://tinyurl.com/39acbewk\nISO 27001: the definitive specification for maintaining an information security management system. See https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html\nNIST Zero Trust Architecture: the definitive report on best-practice security architecture that focuses on constant authentication and authorization instead of network-based privileges. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf\n\nWe will also reference the nascent body of academic research on blockchain recordkeeping, particularly in the field of archival science and research data management. See for example:\n\nBuilding Decentralized Trust (2021) https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030544133\nA Blockchain-Based Notarization Service for Biomedical Knowledge Retrieval (2018) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037018300400\nTrusting Records in the Cloud (2019) https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/page/detail/?k=9781783304028\n\nAdditionally, we will analyze ubiquitous tools for managing information integrity and re-usability that offer an opportunity to bridge trustworthy Cardano data with the wider web domain where most of the online world will continue to conduct its day-to-day affairs. These include Git, IPFS, JSON-LD, Schema.org, and Wikidata.\n\nThe reference implementation software will be a working proof of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification, both of which will be published to our Github repository under open source licenses.\n\nThe reference implementation's technical architecture will leverage Cardano's unique on-chain metadata blocks and copy best-of-breed oracle design patterns such as those demonstrated by Chainlink, Web3 API, and Charli3. We are most excited about applying the Oracle Pools design, first publicized by Emurgo, which normalizes multiple data sources and leverages Cardano's unique Extended UTXO design.\n\nDefining success:\n\nAfter one month:\n\nThe first draft of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification has been circulated for community review and feedback.\n\nAfter three months:\n\nVersion 1.0 of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification has been published.\nThe Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of the Orcfax reference implementation has been deployed on the Cardano blockchain.\nCommunity consultation with Cardano smart contract developers has begun to define the most in-demand oracle endpoints for the first wave of Orcfax oracle deployments: e.g. cryptocurrency price data, sporting event data, weather data, real estate data, public health data, etc.\n\nAfter six months:\n\nThe Orcfax Open Oracle Specification has been updated based on the practical knowledge gained from the MVP implementation.\nThe beta version of the Orcfax reference implementation has been published and has been deployed by one oracle operator external to the Orcfax team.\nThe Orcfax project has deployed its own oracle endpoint(s) which has been tested by at least three smart contract developers external to the Orcfax team.\n\nAfter nine months:\n\nAn Orcfax sustainability plan will be circulated for community feedback. This may include oracle transaction fees, more Project Catalyst funding requests, an Initial Stakepool Offering (ISO) offering, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) or some combination of these. We are not putting the cart before the horse. Orcfax first has to demonstrate that it is an intellectually and technically sound solution and that it has garnered community interest. The primary objective of the sustainability plan is to propose the most cost-effective option that will ensure the long-term availability of affordable, trustworthy, real-world information on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nAfter twelve months:\n\nThe Orcfax sustainability plan has been implemented.\nOrcfax oracles are providing actionable, real-world information to ten+ in-production Cardano smart contracts that hold and distribute ADA.\nThe Orcfax Open Oracle Specification is pursuing a formal standardization process (e.g. CIP, IEEE, W3C, ISO).\n\nBudget:\nThe requested Fund 6 budget is for wages and server expenses for the first three months of the Orcfax project. This will deliver the first version of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification and the reference implementation MVP:\n\n1 x Senior Architect (Peter Van Garderen) x 20 hours per week x $75 USD/hr x 12 weeks = $18,000\n1 x Systems engineer (TBD) x 20 hours per week x $75 USD/hr x 12 weeks = $18,000\n1 x Software developer (TBD) x 20 hours per week x $75 USD/hr x 8 weeks = $12,000\nServer and transaction fees: $500 x 3 months = $1,500\n\nThe $75/hr rate is on the mid-salary scale for senior professionals in the digital archiving and software engineering field (in the Western hemisphere). All three project roles include time allocated for project management and community engagement tasks.\n\nThe team members will provide their own computing equipment. Hosting for the project website and code repositories are provided free of charge via Github. Community outreach will be done via (free) Twitter and YouTube accounts as well as the various Project Catalyst communication channels.\n\nDivision of responsibility:\nThe senior architect and systems engineer both have software engineering skills. They will collaborate in the first month using Agile software development methodology to define and validate the technical requirements for the MVP. While the Open Oracle Specification will be based on the industry standards listed above, it will also be informed by the pragmatic technical requirements identified during this initial analysis stage.\n\nOnce the technical stack has been selected in the first month, a software engineer with the relevant language skills will be added to the team to help complete the MVP.\n\nThe systems engineer will take responsibility for maintaining and securing the off-chain oracle server infrastructure and Cardano node communications.\n\nThe senior architect will be the primary author of the specification as well as the software development supervisor.\n\nLicensing:\nThe source code for the Orcfax reference implementation will be published under a free and open-source MIT license.\n\nThe Orcfax Open Oracle Specification will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0) license.\n\nThis will make the specification free to use and re-distribute in any format. However, the \"No Derivatives\" clause means that altered versions cannot be published. This is to avoid the cherry-picking of specific clauses without respecting the full intent of the specification. That would dilute its reputation and validity. Once it's published, a formal revision process for the Open Oracle Specification will be announced.\n\nWho we are:\nThe Orcfax project is led by Peter Van Garderen, a professional archivist and world renowned expert in the field of digital archiving. See https://vangarderen.net\n\nDating back to medieval times, the archival profession has maintained standards and practices for protecting and demonstrating the authenticity of documents and information objects. Peter is a pioneer in developing free and open-source software systems that implement these standards. He is the founder of Artefactual Systems, a bootstrapped FOSS service company that provides development and support services for the hundreds of institutions worldwide that have deployed the archiving solutions he developed. See http://archivematica.org and https://accesstomemory.org\n\nPeter is also a long-time decentralization advocate and researcher. He spoke on applying archival principles to blockchain technology at the first Decentralized Web Summit hosted at the Internet Archive in 2016. In the past twelve months he has led development teams that won several Filecoin hackfests with projects that provided a Python interface for Filecoin, archived Open Image datasets onto the Filecoin network, and a tool for migrating Facebook content onto Filecoin.\n\nPeter will draw on his wide network of colleagues, collaborators, and newly found Catalyst contacts to hire an experienced systems engineer and software developer who will help him to refine the Orcfax specification and deliver the Orcfax reference implementation software. He is currently in discussion with several qualified systems engineers for that key role.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367650-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367793-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe highest creative potential depends on the mind's clarity and open vision, yet blockchain project development is often an emotional roller coaster.\n\nAs part of the Dyana project, we propose to create community events to develop and deepen the practice of meditation applied to developers' needs.

A CD constitutes a document that signifies the right to withdraw funds that were deposited into an account after a specified period of time plus interest. In practical terms, when a person purchases a CD, for $10,000, the person provides $10,000 to the bank. The bank deposits that money into a special account that corresponds to that particular certificate of deposit. This account is located in and managed by the Bank of the Federal Reserve where it can be insured. The bank then issues a certificate that gives the customer the right to withdraw that deposit plus interest after a specified period of time at a specified interest rate. If the person would like to redeem his or her CD prior to the end of the specified term, there is also a specified fee that the person would have to pay to redeem his or her CD sooner than originally specified. While this instrument is excellent as a secure asset protected from inflation, it could also be a secure tool to convert USD into tokens redeemable for a dollar. It will be inexpensive for the Credit Union to pay the Fed to generate a daily statement of the amount of USD in each insured account (https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/accounting/daily-statement.html). \n\nCredit Unions are non-profit organizations owned by their members whose mission is to support their communities. I am partnering with my local credit union to develop a tool to enable the purchase of CDs with the certificate itself as a set of tokens on the blockchain with a one-to-one correspondence between the number of tokens and the number of insured dollars in the account. These CDs will have no penalty for being redeemed at any time, and as a result, they will not pay interest. Rather, they will just be used to easily and inexpensively convert between stable tokens and USD in a safe and secure way.\n\nEach CD token (CDT) will belong to an asset class with metadata that describes its date of issuance, the institution that issued it, and the account at which its funds can be found. At any time, any CDT will be able to be returned to its bank of issuance and redeemed for its face value from its associated account. When CDT is returned to its bank, it will be burned. Depending on the institution, it ought to be the case that the only fees will be the Cardano transaction fees as banks and credit unions will benefit by being able to offer a greater variety of securities and services to their customer base which will itself expand as the reach of the institution will expand to that of the entire Cardano network.\n\nIn the Metadata Challenge, I will submit a proposal to create a metadata server that will monitor the state of audited accounts against the state of their on-chain representations. This will allow consumers to freely transact in different issuances of stable tokens from different institutions and allow wallet applications to treat them as being interchangeable.\n\nThis will be good for my local community because I would like to be able to employ the homeless via smart contracts. I would also like to decrease the amount that local businesses have to pay in fees to the Visa-Mastercard network. These benefits extend to any community all over the world with a reliable stable token. So long as the Federal Reserve exists, so as long as the US Dollar exists, these tokens will be secure, stable and protected.\n\nSuccess in 3 months will be that in which we have a proof-of-concept running on the test net such that it has been integrated with Campus USA Credit Union's accounting systems and automated via the banking portal. Success in 6 months will constitute having scaled to users in Gainesville and having offered education to local businesses on how to accept payments and account using CDT on Cardano. At 12 months, if IOHK has implemented Babel fees, we should see mass local adoption in partnership with the City of Gainesville.\n\nI do not expect to benefit financially in the near term, so if I could have $50 for transportation costs for my trips between my domicile and the Credit Union, it would be awesome.\n\nI expect to have a public launch on or by February 1st, 2022.\n\nAttached, I have included a working draft of the proposal that I am providing to the banks. It is a rough draft, but please judge it harshly. I will update it as quickly as possible as I refine my approach and finish my implementation.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367811-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nStable assets should be decentralized and issued by many different institutions. These institutions may have funds insured by the NCUA and FDIC. The Fed offers auditing services(https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/accounting/daily-statement.html) for these insured accounts. These audits can be made publicly available, and an oracle can compare the quantity of the tokens in circulation to the audited assets backing the token. When a person uses the stable token to make a payment, the smart contract mediating this payment can call the oracle to verify that the asset is in fact still backed and secure the transaction in validation.\nI propose to develop a standard with the community that will allow us to audit assets and transact in stable assets from a variety of sources. This is to say that CD accounts will be located in/secured by the Federal Reserve Bank or the National Credit Union Administration. These organizations can provide daily balance statements. In effects, these entities can provide audits for a nominal fee. These audits can be published publicly and thus validate the legitimacy of any token on a given stable token registry. This enables a wallet to group assets based on the results of their audits. Wallets will be able to automatically reject or notify the user during a transaction when a token has failed its daily audit. Otherwise, instead of the user having to keep account of all of his or her stable tokens backed by numerous different banks and thus having various AssetIDs, the end user can simply draw from a secure bag of stable tokens in his or her wallet. The database will also be used to instruct the user on how to redeem the user's CD tokens for their corresponding share of the CD at the bank of issuance. Banks and Credit Unions will ultimately accept and redeem CD tokens issued by other banks and credit unions enabling the stable tokens to be used at ATMs and in other convenient contexts.\nPerhaps this could be implemented in conjunction with the Cardano Foundation's token registry(https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry).\nSuccess in 3 months would be to have a working system that has been released to the public. Success at 6 and 12 months will be rapid adoption.\nIn terms of funds, I do not have the time to implement this by myself. So, will have to hire a developer from the community for a few months. Thus, $10,000 will be payed for the duration of a 3-month contract. I am open to applications.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367816-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nSummary\n\nKafka ecosystem provides the components to correlate massive volumes of data in real-time to provide situational awareness across the Cardano ecosystem to find all needles in the haystack.

In summary mistrust.\nThis causes a perpetual spiraling of healthcare costs with 90% of the citizens having no cover of any sort.\nThere is an unserved population of 13.5 million people in Zimbabwe (an African state) due to the fact that they do not meet the strict rules of the insurance actors, but not necessarily because they do not have the money.\nAmongst other hardships faced in a region suffering inflation and economic collapse, there are no social welfare initiatives to rely on. An unforeseeable medical condition could literally be your death sentence.\nThe impact of the government's fiscal policies on the health sector has been devastating. An attached report by Transparency International in 2015 is still very relevant, and the situation was only made direr by the passage of time.\nAfrican healthcare, can not be solved strictly by medical insurance models,  or westernized approaches.\nThe financial model used by leading medical insurance companies (pay as you breathe models) in the neighboring country of South Africa has generated untold riches for their stakeholders but has not delivered universal healthcare.\n\n \n\nMedical insurance companies profit through;\n\nJustifying higher premiums, by faulting the behaviors of the patients\nCreating, and mis-advertising, the coverage of the medical scheme\nPutting in comprehensive processes tailored to reject health claims\nOutsourcing actual service of healthcare, leading towards collusion\nMedical institutions inflate costs, relying on the guarantee of payment from insurance companies\n\n \n\nClearly, the problem is large, but there is hope yet in Blockchain!\n\n \n\nOur Solution\n\nWe are not rushing to create the holy grail of medical insurance for Africa. We are going to tackle this problem in stages and we need everyone's help to create a concept, then MVP, then roll it out into a test pilot project\n\nWe at Wutano do not believe we need to re-think healthcare. Sacha Robinson, the founder of Wutano and member of the Zimbabwean diaspora, has had a United Kingdom experience and discovered the peace of mind afforded by the UK Nation Health Service, the best system of healthcare in the world and affordable for all. If you are in need you will get treatment on the NHS without discrimination on income or status grounds. \n\nThe Wutano model offers to buy the services of a health practitioner on a capped compensation basis (equating to a full salary in some cases) and in return, the health specialist does not charge any of our Wutano members at the point of service.\nWutano brings to Zimbabwe the practices of NHS, relying not on taxation, but crowd-funded healthcare services governed through fair usage policies. The Wutano, off-chain network has already grown to 200 healthcare providers, with a growth rate of 50 users every month which is being controlled to ensure the community funds pot can afford payments to providers.\nThe model is also supported by: fair usage practice, share the risk, prioritize access to services based on health-promoting behaviors, and protect the Wutano treasury from bad actors.\n\n \n\nAnthony Jackson, a Catalyst Community member, and kindred Zimbabwean visionary believes the value proposition of Wutano and the social impact that digitization of the company would bring to Zimbabwe is too great to be limited by the current capacity of the team.\n\nAlongside the existing mechanisms, as summarised above, we desire a smart contract whereby the excess of your medical aid premium is invested on your behalf. In effect, your medical aid contributions to Wutano become an investment, and even possibly a pension. And the very same collective is the healthcare instrument that would provide for the sick, and elderly.\nThis proposal does not seek to create that smart contract. Wutano has limited comprehension as to what that might entail. Furthermore, without community adoption and suggestions from Blockchain experts, a proposal of that nature would be premature.\n\n \n\nUse Of Grant Funds\n\nThis grant would be used to develop a real-world use case, with the grand design in mind. Using secure no-code platforms, we will rapidly develop the idea and follow patterns that translate to Blockchain.\n\nWe have approached healthcare providers in the Wutano network, who are interested in piloting the adoption of Blockchain and are willing to invest their services and assets towards a more liquid healthcare model more resilient and capable of meeting the demands of the sick. \n\n \n\nProposal\n\nWe consider this a soft touch of Cardano with the team, to develop value proposals that inspire collaboration and participation in Catalyst from the healthcare providers, while simultaneously developing competencies and relationships needed to fully realize the vision.\n\nWe are looking to partner with Blockchain experts and thought leaders in this space, and welcome any collaboration as part of this initiative. We believe strongly in the potential of Wutano, and wish to serve the people as soon as the technology allows.\n\n \n\nProject Activities\n\n \n\nHire developers to design (not build) a token, and build BLC data repositories for the pilot project and treasury function\nA Minimum Viable Product concept is most desired at this stage\nDesign on paper the security and distributed audit features, the customer journey \nHave an appreciation of the marketing for Wutano health token, and its association to Cardano.\nThink-tank to design input of data onto the blockchain such as income, expenses, usage, occupancy, service reviews.\nWutano Token valuation model inside a new ecosystem.\nHave the full discussion on the outlook of an eventual white paper.\n\n \n\nWhat is the work plan or approach being taken? - Just Planning and Ideation\n\nFind competent resources\n- Developers to map patient journeys in a distributed health approach\n- Map registry, treasury function, agency network, and procurement/logistics functions\nAcquire input from a local medical center \n- Purely to offer digital asset mapping rather than an overt offer of blockchain\n- Vendor outreach programs on the same premise of the above point\n\n \n\n Other activities will include: Wutano's Overton Window Journey\n\nPolicy – ideate the digital blockchain policy \nPopularise -marketing department to discuss plans for meme-ology, tribe creation, and virality of the token when launched.\nSensible Actions - assess the services required to the pre-signing agency network.

To continue down this path of being the \"most environmentally sustainable\" cryptocurrency, Cardano should further align its values and goals to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). UN has 169 associated targets and over 5000 active actions with various sectors to build a sustainable future. UN has set a 2030 Agenda, called Catalyst 2030, that has over 39,000 full-time employees in 71 countries serving over 180 countries and has reached over 4 billion people worldwide. By aligning Cardano's values with the SDGs, Cardano will be able to connect with a vast number of corporations that are actively supporting SDGs which can in turn increase mass adoption rate towards Cardano. To bring Cardano's vision of success a reality, WottleNFT aims to do just that.\n\nWottleNFT strives to be the first Sustainable NFT Auction Site that aims to build an interconnected ecosystem between Cardano NFTs and Social Enterprises. The reason why Cardano should work with Social Enterprises is because they are the driving forces behind SDGs. In 2020, there are more than 600 member institutions and 900 individuals working in more than 190 countries that are covering all 17 UN SDGs. The impact of collaborations with social enterprises is also shifting philanthropies by breaking down traditional silos that are interconnected, such as education, health or nutrition. If Cardano were to assist Social Enterprises worldwide, it can not only accelerate UN's progress towards achieving the 2030 SDGs goals, but will also be able to change the hearts and minds of funders to a more holistic and systemic approach towards fundings.\n\nTim Hanstad, a former social entrepreneur and current CEO of the philanthropic Chandler Foundation shares that \"You can't effectively educate a systemically malnourished child, and by tapping into networks such as Catalyst 2030, philanthropic organisations can more effectively evaluate need and apply their respective funding strategies to the problem as a whole. This way of working is not without its challenges, but we are seeing this is increasingly accepted as the way to go in the future.\"\n\nSocial Entrepreneurs are fuelled by a sense of urgency and a passion to deliver an impact. There is only have nine years left to achieve the SDGs. Only by working together can we stand a chance of making a difference to the lives that matters most.\n\nHow does WottleNFT work?\n\nThe business model of WottleNFT works similar to that of a social enterprise, with a twist. On top of royalties, a portion of the auction fees that WottleNFT collects, are channeled towards social enterprises. After an NFT auction has ended, the highest bidder will get to choose one of the 17 SDG goal that he/she supports. Afterwhich, he/she will choose a social enterprise that supports that underlying SDG goal. Once chosen, the smart contract will automate the auction transaction and channels the fees towards the chosen social enterprise. Since these donations came from the highest bidder, his/her efforts will not go unnoticed. Each profile on WottleNFT will have a transparent track-record of his/her contributions to Social Enterprises worldwide. Doing so, WottleNFT will not just be an ordinary NFT Auction Site, but an interoperable gateway to connect Social Enterprises with the Cardano Community.\n\nRoadMap\n\nPhase 1 (May - Aug 2021)\n\n- Ideation\n\n- Launch of Instagram\n\n- Launch of Twitter\n\n- Launch of Discord Server\n\n- Launch of Landing Page v1.0\n\n- Launch of Staking Pool WOT\n\n- Tokenomics Ideation\n\n \n\nPhase 2 (Sep - Dec 2021)\n\n- RoadMap\n\n- Launch of WottleNFT Tokenomics (More details will be released soon)\n\n- Building a global community with Social Enterprises, NFT Collectors and Creators \n\n- Launch of Landing Page v2.0 with Auction Testing\n\n- Minting of Utility Tokens / NFTs\n\n \n\nPhase 3 (Jan - Mar 2022)\n\n- Launch of WottleNFT Auction Site v1.0\n\n- Expanding WottleNFT Team\n\n \n\nPhase 4 (Apr 2022 -)\n\n- Upgrade of WottleNFT Auction Site v2.0\n\n- Minting of Utility Tokens / NFTs\n\n- Expanding WottleNFT Team\n\n \n\nFunding Breakdown\n\nStaking Pool \n\n- Raspberry Pis ($500)\n\n- Set-Up Cost ($2000)\n\n \n\nMinting Utility Tokens / NFTs \n\n- $1000 ($10 per Utility Token / NFTs)\n\n \n\nSoftware\n\n- AWS EC2 Instance ($120/month) -> $1200 for one year\n\n- Dynamo DB ($40/month) -> $480 for one year\n\n- Blockfrost API ($69/month) -> $828 for one year\n\n- Professional Email ($21/month) -> $252 for one year (for one user)\n\n- Typeform ($40/month) -> $480 for one year\n\n- Domain ($1/month) -> $12 for one year\n\n \n\nSmart Contracts\n\n-> $10,000\n\n \n\nGrand Total = $2500 + $1000 + $3252 + $10000 = $16,725","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367734-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWkipedia with Monetization on Cardano!\n\n \n\nCatalyst helps to form communities and drive innovation in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nIf we want to bring proposers in from other areas, the best way is to bring the same solution to their domains.\n\nDeveloping countries have huge opportunities to leap ahead in productivity, just by upgrading their technology to current standards.

QModeler is capable of synthesizing models into smart contracts.\n\nFerdon is launching the first of its kind, no-code hackathons, long-running  events that bring together communities to solve pressing issues using No-Code tools.  \n\nFerdon's active projects include\n\nIn collaboration with WADA we have launched a first of its kind no-code hackathon to develop a solution for food safety traceability in Africa.\nLaunching a no-code hackathon in Vietnam to develop a solution to food traceability  in Vietnam. \n\nflagship product\n\nFerdon's flagship  product is a low-code platform for developing the blockchain. see link below\n\n A B O U T  K A G G L E\n\nFerdon will be setting up a competent on kaggle to train an AI algorithm to assemble software legos into full applications. Kaggle is the world's largest community of data scientists with:\n\n5 million members  \n4 million uploaded solutions \n300  competitions\n50,000 open data sets \n\nYou can read more about Kaggle competitions here ->  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions\n\nA B O U T  T H E   P R O J E C T\n\n This project will set about to create a new era in software development by introducing AI assembled software.  This project is to fund hosting a  Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) , where we expect several experienced teams to work on completing the prototypes we have developed. \n\nwhat is graph pebbling\n\nGraph Pebbling is a board game that, because it has a property called Turing Complete, can be used to solve computer problems and is as powerful as any computer language. Graph Pebbling has been the subject of hundreds of research papers.\n\nwhy is graph pebbling important\n\nAn AI solution to create a winning strategy for Graph Pebbling is also a solution to some of the worlds most pressing problems and will unlock a new ways to think about software and software solutions to many of the worlds most urgent problems, available on-demand to those who need them most.\n\nQModeler was built using Graph Pebbling and does not support any other language. Because of this QModeler can be made to synthesize smart contracts, logic for IoT devices, cloud applications,... \n\nhow hard is this problem to solve\n\nWe are confident it is not hard. The hardest part of solving the many problems is reducing a problem to a know problem space- in our case component assembly.  We provide (1) a clear unambiguous definition of how components fit together and (2), a way to unambiguously define what it is we want to be build. (3) a user-friendly way for non-technical users create components and describe what they want to build.  (1) and (2) define a problem space with several solutions in solving board games, assembling legos, and solving crossword puzzles. \n\n  why use gaggle\n\nThere are several reasons why we decided to host a  Kaggle  Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)\n\naccess to experts or Kaggle Masters\ntraining AI algorithms requires expensive specialized hardware \nKaggle competitions will produce many solutions from many competitors that we want to review. \n\n what kind of applications benefit the most\n\nAny application could benefit but categories that would benefit more than others includes\n\napplications that involve many parties  such as supply chains, food provenance, cold chains, market places\napplications that integrate with other on-chain protocols such as AMM, exchanges, liquidity pools. \napplications that integrate with off applications - oracles, enterprise applications...\napplications that require on-ramping into enterprises such as banks and others \napplications build through no-code crowd sourcing. \n\nM O N I T I Z A T I O N  M O D E L\n\n Developers work in a highly centralized model where the middleman, large software vendors,  receive the lions share of profits.  An AI based system will allow developers to set prices of components they build and track when the component is being used. \n\n   We expect around 2% -20% of the revenue produced by an AI generated product will be divided among the builders of the       component \n\nI M P A C T\n\nreduced cost of software -  A single toolbox of components can create several, hundreds, of highly customized applications. \ndeveloper productivity - The productivity of developers will skyrocket many fold. Developing a solution will produce components, or legos, that AI can use to create solutions for many problems spaces. AI will take care of assembling the other solutions when they are requested. \ntemplates creation -  The AI marketplace is better than a template, Ai will be able to create several applications from the same legos.  \ndeveloper Incentivization - Developers will get  continuous streams ofrevenues from components they upload to the marketplace. \nnetwork effects - The project will increase the network effect on Cardano by increasing interoperability. optimistically we could calculate this to be the square if the interoperable components. \nEcosystem Richness - A toolbox of software building blocks can be the genesis of hundreds, even thousands, of applications. \nMore Targeted Applications - Many applications such as food safety have a one-size-fits all approach but sadly that one-size does not fit rural farmers in Africa or Vietnam. Many such applications are highly flows negotiated between a few small farmers and can't be captured in a single application. \n\nF E A S A B I L I T Y\n\n  The project will determine if teams on the Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) can assemble components built using QModeler where the rules that prescribe which components can be connected and how they should be connected have been unambiguously defined. \n\nOur team has already achieved over 90% automation ( demonstrated in our video )\nThe teams at Kaggle are the best AI experts in the world.  The title of  Kaggle Master and Kaggle Grand Master  is a universally recognized distinction. (https://www.kaggle.com/progression)\nThis is a known problem space with several known AI solutions that already exist.  \nOften over 1000 teams will compete to to solve a single challenge, with teams using different approaches. \nAI can assemble toys from Legos and solve Jigsaw Puzzles. All these problems have the same characteristics namely (1) a clear unambiguous definition of how components fit together and (2), a way to define what it is we want to be built. \nAI has been highly democratized and with tools like OpenAI that can train algorithm to have winning strategies against board games rather easily.

This is why the institute where nation-states representatives gather and decisions are getting made is called - \"parliament\": The place to \"parle\" - to speak, to talk, to discuss. Discussions allow the participants to express different opinions and perspectives and to take into consideration the pros and cons, the benefits and the risks before decisions are made.\n\nBut discussions are not scalable. Discussions create noise, and when there is too much noise it is hard to identify the signal, i.e. the data that is relevant and contributes to the process. This is why only a small group of a few hundred people, at most, can take an active part in parliaments, and the other millions of people can only delegate their voice by voting.\n\nIn the Catalyst project, the governance is being made by voting on proposals on-chain. Problems/needs are often identified by community-wide discussion. Solutions often are not. The focus on proposals leaves outside wider policy challenges that are relevant to the community, such as process guidelines, community code of conduct, monetary policy etc. Discussions on issues regarding the future of Cardano and Catalyst are disconnected from the voting process and spread around on different platforms: ideascale, google-docs, telegram, discord, reddit and others.\n\nThis situation makes the decision-making process ineffective and creates a risk of getting decisions that are not in the best interest of the community and its members. Also, it may discourage many members from taking an active part in the process.\n\nOur Solution:\n\nConsenz is a platform that was created to address those problems and offer a proven solution.\n\nThe discussion in Consenz is different from other platforms in a few aspects:\n\nInstead of an endless and chaotic thread of comments, there is a focus and a product to the process: A document that can be discussed and edited by the participants and reflect their agreements.\nThere is a clear structure to the content: comments are attributed to a specific section and function as arguments for or against it; sections are attributed to a specific topic; topics are attributed to the document.\nThere is a voting system that allows the users to express their opinion without adding more noise to the discussion.\nThe voting system also creates a method to deal with conflicts and determine which opinion has the majority of participants' agreements.\nThose agreements are separated from the noise by a simple algorithm that determines which section received enough support and can be added to the document automatically.\n\nSee the demo: https://app.consenz.co.il/document/catalyst-demo/welcome\n\nThis is how the discussion in Consenz works (see also the diagram attached):\n\nThe discussion can begin with an existing draft or on a blank page.   \n\nUsers can publish new section suggestions to the document topics. \n\nFor every section or section suggestion, users can suggest improvements by editing the section text.  \n\nEvery new section suggestion or improvement suggestion stands for discussion and for a vote:\n4.1 Users can comment on the section, or comment on other users' comments.\n4.2 Users can vote \"for\" or \"against\" the section suggestion.   \n\nWhen the sum of \"for\" votes minus the \"against\" votes reaches a predetermined threshold, the suggestion changes status from \"in a vote\" to \"approved\".\n5.1 New approved section suggestions are added to the document automatically.\n5.2 Newly approved Improvement suggestion replaces the existing section.    \n\nEvery time that the document is changed (i.e. a new section or an improvement suggestion is approved) The approving threshold for new and existing suggestions is updated according to those parameters:\n6.1 The number of participants in the process at the time of the change.\n6.2 The consensus that the current draft has reached so far, i.e. the for/against votes ratio of the approved sections.\n6.3 This calculation is made by the \"consensus meter\" algorithm.  \n\n \n\n The Project Status\n\nSince 2018 we have been building a prototype of Consenz (until lately it was available only in Hebrew) and in 2020-2021 we have completed a proof-of-concept phase. The app prototype has been used by diverse groups for different purposes in Israel, among them:\n\nSchools' teams used Consenz to create teaching guidelines during the covid19 restrictions.\nProtest movements used Consenz to create demands lists.\nEnvironmental organizations used it to collaborate with government and municipality workers to create plans for dealing with the climate crisis.\n\nNow we wish to configure the platform to the Catalyst and Cardano community needs and processes, and ultimately expand to serve all sorts of DAO's in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn order to do that, we plan to:\n\nImplement a new UX/UI design based on the lessons and experience that we have collected during the proof-of-concept phase\nAdd a gamification layer on top of the existing user interface\nAdd a delegation layer on top of the existing user interface, that can be used for reputation representation as well\nCreate infrastructure for future integration of the platform voting mechanism to the Cardano blockchain smart contracts for high security, immutability and transparency.\nOpen the code by adding proper documentation and improving accessibility for new developers, and invite the developers' community to take part in building and improving the platform.\nReaching out to other initiatives that are working to improve decision making processes in the Catalyst community for potential collaboration.\n\nROADMAP\n\nQ1 2021: Build Functional prototype: Completed\n\nQ2 2021: At least 5 iterations with real users for proof of concept: Completed\n\nQ3 2021: Design new UX/UI: In progress\n\n>> Q4 2021 Build MVP web app\n\nQ1 2022: Gamification and Delegation layers\n\nQ2 2022: Integration with Cardano smart contracts\n\n \n\nCosts Breakdown\n\nApp Frontend:\n\nGroup channel page: 5,000 USD  \n\nDraft page: 2,000 USD  \n\nDiscussion Page: 6,000 USD  \n\nUser profile management page: 2,500 USD  \n\nAdmin panel: 7,500 USD\n\n Onboarding users:\n\nLanding Page: 1,500 USD \n\nExplanatory video: 500 USD  \n\nTotal: 25,000 USD\n\n \n\nKey Metrics to measure\n\nQuality success metrics will be measured by the use of the products that will be created by the Consenz platform, i.e. the documents that will be discussed and created by the community. We wish to see during the first 3 months after a launch of the MVP at least 5 documents that will be used as guidelines, policy shapers and other purposes that answer the Catalyst community needs.\n\nQuantity success metrics will be compared to the overall community participation in the current governance process of project Catalyst, i.e., the number of wallet addresses that cast votes using the official voting app. The metrics will consider exposure (unique user traffic according to google analytics) and onboarding registered users on Consenz.\n\nFor Fund8:\n\nExposure to 15% of voters\nOnboarding 5% of voters \n\nFor Fund9:\n\nExposure to 25% of voters\nOnboarding 7% of voters\n\netc.\n\nThe Team:\n\nConsenz founder and Project Manager: Aharon Porath, a techno-social entrepreneur. \n\nSince 2011, Aharon has been involved in a few tech and non-tech ventures to develop consensus-based decision-making methods and platforms for distributed public participation goals.\n\nAharon has 6 years of experience as a project manager of web platforms and apps, among them - \"Open Committee\", a web app that enables environmental activists, NGOs and citizens to participate in the decision-making process of Israel's planning department. \"Open Committee\" is funded by the Israeli government innovation authority.\n\nDesign and Development: Sofi, a software cooperative that provides solutions for municipalities, universities, startups, well-established companies, entrepreneurs and NGOs.

Benefits to Cardano Ecosystem:\n\nMarlowe has been designed to be used by someone who is an expert in the field of financial contracts or business, but does not have programming skills and experience. We will simplify and localize the documentation, add specific examples and promote them to users in various ways (broadcast to social networks, information technology incubators, workshop at universities). We believe that doing so will raise their awareness about how easy Marlowe is and bring more people, ideas, and dApps to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe localization of plutus training materials will help programmers understand the programming methods and build applications on the cardano platform.

This culture includes lived experience of exclusion, poverty and marginalisation; and also, a tendency towards mutual aid, because homeless people have to develop networks of mutual support between themselves in order to survive. As a result, \"homeless culture\" often has a perspective on questions of value and contribution that is unique and vital. We believe this perspective could enrich the Cardano community; and in turn, Cardano could empower homeless people. By inviting homeless people to engage with Cardano from where they are, using the perspective of their community and its culture, and by using facilitators who have their own lived experience of homelessness, we are addressing the challenge's key focus on enabling people to bring their own cultural understanding to Cardano.  \"Cultural understanding\" is not only about the culture of a particular country or language – it can also be about shared experience.\n\nThe people we will reach are unlikely to have any blockchain expertise, although they may have some tech skills. So we are addressing the challenge's aim of driving adoption at ground level, by people who do not already have blockchain expertise. And because the UK homeless community includes a mix of migrant people and UK-born people, and a wide range of levels of ability in English, our project also addresses the challenge's aim of enabling people to take part in their own language; our budget includes money for interpretation/translation where needed, and we plan to pay people from within the community itself as interpreters, and to encourage participants to work in their first language if they wish.\n\nThe first step in empowering any community to change their lives is to create a space where people can develop and crystallise their OWN understanding of the problem. This might be called community \"problem-sensing\". By making space for this, our project meets the challenge of empowering people to change their lives.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat the Homeless Hub will do\n\n1. Problem-Sensing Workshops\n\nA series of 15 weekly workshops will be held with homeless communities in Manchester, UK, working in association with local grassroots homeless organisations that the proposal team have existing links with.\n\nThese workshops will explore questions of value, worth, contribution, power, governance and participation through the lens of lived experience of homelessness, and will allow time and space for participants to define and articulate problems, and research whether these problems could be addressed using blockchain technology.\n\nSessions will be documented, and key questions and perspectives that arise in sessions will be fed back to the Cardano community through its various channels (e.g. Discord; Telegram; the Town Hall; social media), thus opening dialogue between the homeless community and the Cardano community.\n\n \n\n2. Building a community hub\n\nThese initial workshops will build confidence, and shared understanding, to enable the group of homeless people to lead a community hub.\n\nThis hub will have its roots in the homeless community, but might also engage others locally. We envisage it leading to a public event where homeless people can tell non-homeless locals about blockchain technology and its implications for all of our empowerment.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur measures of success\n\nat 3 months (end of January 2022)\n\n3 organisations working with homeless people onboarded. At least 10 participants engaged, and sessions are in progress.\nInitial baseline evaluation done with participants – what did they know about blockchain before the project?\nParticipants feel welcomed in the sessions, know that their contribution is valued, and are enjoying taking part.\nParticipants report increased awareness of blockchain technology, increased confidence in expressing ideas about it.\nParticipants are beginning to take ownership, and shape the project towards the things that interest them.\nWe (facilitators and participants) are regularly sharing short insights from the sessions, via social media, Catalyst sessions, Town Hall, etc; and opening channels of communication and dialogue between Cardano and the project participants.\n\nA mid-term evaluation will ask participants whether all this is happening. (If it's not, project team and participants will look at how to fix it.)\n\nat 6 months (end of April 2022)\n\nAll 15 sessions delivered. Sessions have been a homeless-led space, where people could think and talk about ideas around value, worth, contribution, power, governance and participation in a way that centres their experience and perspectives.\nA final project output or launch has been developed by participants, marketed widely, and delivered. This could be an event engaging the wider public, or something more internal to the homeless community, depending on what participants want to do.\nDuring project delivery, we have found meaningful ways to create a 2-way dialogue between participants and Cardano, and to share with Cardano the insights emerging from the sessions, giving homeless people a voice in Cardano's thinking on how to engage communities. Or, if we've identified barriers to this, we have looked together at how to address those barriers.\nThe project has focused on the strengths and skills of the homeless community, not purely on its problems. Also, participants have been able to take part as *people*, and have not focused solely on homelessness issues if they didn't want to.\nAny barriers to ongoing participation have been clearly identified, and possible solutions discussed with participants.\nParticipants have been publicly credited, in whatever ways they choose, for all their contributions to the project.\n\nat 12 months (end of Nov 2022; i.e. after end of project)\n\nThe project team will write a report, documenting best practice and learning-points from the project, and will share it with participants, homeless organisations in the UK and worldwide, and Cardano.\nThe experiences of the project will add to ongoing conversations within Cardano about how to onboard people \"on the ground\" in communities around the world, and how to create mechanisms for effective dialogue between Cardano and communities.\n12 months on, Homeless Hub might not continue in its original form (i.e. running regular weekly sessions) – but we aim for it be able to demonstrate some kind of legacy. This could include ongoing personal contacts and networking between project particpants and Catalyst (or individuals within Catalyst); ongoing links with organisations who work with homeless people, both in Manchester and more widely; increased awareness of Cardano in the homeless community; and ideally, the project team mentoring project participants to develop a proposal for Fund 8 or 9 which is led and devised by the homeless community themselves.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExpected public launch date\n\nThe project will be launched to the homeless community in late November/early December 2021.\n\nThe public launch date will be in April 2022, as part of the project's final output or event.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKey potential risks, and how we will mitigate them\n\nCOVID issues (e.g. if there is a further UK lockdown) might make indoor, face-to-face group sessions impossible. This currently seems unlikely to happen in the UK after October; but if it does, we will mitigate by delivering via a combination of remote methods (e.g. video, online discussion), one-to-one meetings, and outdoor/walking group sessions as we move into Spring.\n\nParticipant dropout rates can be high with this community; often because projects are too inflexible, and do not understand the barriers to participation that homeless people face. We will mitigate by building group cohesion gradually (for example, structuring the early sessions so each one is self-contained and people don't have to attend them all); by offering expenses to enable participants to attend; and by offering ways that participants can contribute remotely if they miss a session, or even keep in touch with the project remotely if they need to drop out altogether. We'll also engage the help of our partner homelessness organisations, to encourage and support participants; and we'll initially recruit more participants than our minimum, to allow for some dropping-out.\n\nSlight risk that media myths about the \"crypto boom\" might give participants unrealistic expectations of what the project can offer. We will mitigate this with clear information from the outset about what the project will offer; and by enabling participants to find out about blockchain, discuss the issues, and counter the myths.\n\nRisks around sustaining the energy after the end of the funded project. We will mitigate this by our focus throughout on empowering participants to take ownership, so that when funding ends, participants have the tools to continue for themselves. We will also ensure that participants, and the staff of the homeless organisations we are working with, know how to stay connected with Cardano and with Catalyst after the end of the project, and that participants particularly have support to do so and are welcomed. We also aim, after the end of the project, to mentor participants to create their own homeless-led proposal for fund 8 or 9.\n\n \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposal Team\n\nStephen Whitenstall (@swhitenstall) has personal experience of homelessness, living in hostels for 5 years between 2004 and 2010.

For example, see The National Archives Of The Republic Of The Homeless, a 2019 project with homeless and ex-homeless artists in Hull, England: https://homeless.omeka.net\n\n \n\nHomeless Hub is a project of QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) an ongoing open source project that provides support for the Cardano Project Catalyst Community. Homeless Hub's project documentation will follow  QA-DAO ideals of open-source transparency and auditability.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBudget\n\nFacilitator: initial liaison with grassroots homeless orgs; 5 days' work over a 2-month period at start of project (end October 2021 to December 2021).\n$ 1375\n\nFacilitator: direct work with participants, plus session planning, monitoring/evaluation, marketing and promotion, and ongoing project development, early January 2022 to end April 2022\n$ 7000\n\nParticipants' expenses - to recompense participants for giving us their expertise.\n$ 4000\n\nCommunity interpreters' expenses\n$ 2100\n\nMaterials budget / production costs (Whatever the group wants to produce, e.g. a public event, minting an NFT, producing a short film, etc.)\n$ 2500\n\nRoom hire\n$ 600\n\nZoom account\n$ 165\n\nGitBook account costs\n$ 140\n\nProject tracking on GitHub\n$ 1100\n\nTotal $ 18980\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow this proposal will impact the challenge metrics\n\nHow many new Hubs were launched in the next 6 months?\n\nOur proposal will set up one new hub.\n\nHow many new users of Cardano were onboarded?\n\nThe project will directly reach 10 participants from the homeless community, who will be onboarded into Cardano. Additionally, the project will attract wider attention, and we aim to onboard 5 additional people, both from the non-homeless local community where we are working, and among the staff of organisations working with homeless people in the UK.\n\nWhat was the total reach of the Hub's initial marketing launch?\n\nInitially we will be working with a core group of homeless participants to build capacity, and the Hub will not be fully public. We aim for 30 people (both homeless people, and staff working in homeless organisations) to become aware of the project, and of these, 10 homeless people will form the core project participants. The public marketing launch, to market and promote the project's outcome event in April, will happen later in the project; we aim to reach c. 1,000 people with our marketing, via social media, live publicity materials distributed locally, and word-of-mouth.\n\nHow many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\n\nThe project will draw its participants from 3 organisations working with homeless people in Manchester, UK, so these organisations will therefore be aware of the Cardano ecosystem. During the course of the project, we aim to conduct outreach to 3 additional community organisations in the local area (such as tenants' groups, parents' groups, etc), and bring them into the Cardano ecosystem via social media engagement with our project, raised awareness of Cardano, and offering the opportunity to join Catalyst workshops and events such as Town Halls.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReferences\n\n- A home for all: Understanding migrant homelessness in Great Britain\n\nhttps://www.crisis.org.uk/media/241452/a_home_for_all_understanding_migrant_homelessness_in_great_britain_2019.pdf","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367891-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nThis proposal seeks seed funding for phase one development of an augmented reality (AR) mobile game App the core objective of which is the capture, breed and trade digital bison. Called BISONTOKEN, these NFT-empowered digital 3D animated bison shall, in time, demonstrate the \"life-like\" characteristics of real bison, generating adrenaline-pumping game play.\nWe define \"living\" smart contracts in the context of these NFTs as being able to respond to external economic and environmental conditions by being able to programmatically and periodically modify the terms written into the contract's metadata. In the context of our BISONTOKEN game pieces (virtual bison) this initially manifests in the programmable \"health\" of the animal as it \"matures,\" its reproductive capacity and its environmental responsiveness. The same programmable characteristics could subsequently be applied to other virtual \"living\" organisms or economic activities.\nPlayable on both iOS and Android platforms for smartphones and tablets, this demonstrator will utilize SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) technology initially to display life-sized, three-dimensional bison. The creation of these digital bison will enable the developers to both showcase future game play and, importantly, begin testing periodic metadata updates. The developers see this as the first in a series of progressive steps to bring \"artificial intelligence\" to these digital avatars via future interaction with SingularityNET nodes.\nBecause of its mobile (out-of-doors) game format, the developers also see the project as an important way to encourage players to be more active physically, in contrast to more sedentary desktop-oriented games. The goal is to introduce players and the general gaming audiences to the benefits of the Cardano blockchain and its \"living\" smart contract metadata capabilities.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367893-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\"From data abuse to personal data control and direct compensation\" – implementing and developing on top of the Cardano blockchain a (personal) data management and data sharing platform with integrated DID (ATALA PRISM) that (i) gives people back control over their personal information by choosing who has access to the data and (2) compensates them for the use of their data and for their attention.\n\nBefore going into our detailed proposal, we included a short summary on the (i) team, (ii) the cardano adoption in the next 3/6 months; (iii) a summary of our existing product in which we will insert the POC under this fund, and (iv) what 3-6-12 months success looks like.\n\nTeam – We have a versatile team with experience in blockchain projects that is able and committed to tackle this challenge within the budget proposed.\n\n     Michiel Van Roey – tech and privacy lawyer https://www.linkedin.com/in/michielvanroey/\n\n     Rajasekaran Yogarajah – senior developer (in plutus pioneer program) https://www.linkedin.com/in/life-artist/\n\n     Luke Bragg – product architect - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasbragg/\n\n     Ipek Sahiner – senior engineer in tech industry https://www.linkedin.com/in/ipeksahinerschlecht/\n\n     Shawn Jensen https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnj/ \n\nCardano adoption in the next 3 - 6 months - We are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 20.000 expected by Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6\n\nIntroduction to Profila and the Profila App\n\nProfila GmbH is a Swiss company founded in 2018 with the main focus to give people control over their personal data and (re)connect brands with individuals in a privacy preserving manner, one-to-one and at scale. Profila has a vision of giving people agency over their online lives, and giving brands a better way to build meaningful customer relationships.\n\nThe major functionalities available in the Profila platform (mobile app for consumers and web portal for brands): \n\n1. Privacy education and privacy rights management – people can learn about privacy and their legal rights, and exercise them towards brands via an easy 3-click process (see our funded proposal in fund 5 – \"control your data; privacy ledger\", https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088))\n\n2. Ethical and consented data sharing - Individuals can select to share certain information to with a brand of their choosing and get compensated for it. (see our proposal in fund 6 – \"dapp to control/monetize your data\" - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/366908-48088))\n\nWe already have a finished mobile application (2 years in development) to integrate this Fund 6 proof of concept in and are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected by end 2021; 78.200 expected by end Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6).\n\nSuccess after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be to have a succesful integration of PRISM DID into the Profila app as our identity management system component. Success after 6 months would be to test with new customers that join Profila. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of ATALA PRISM, used by each profila user.\n\n \n\nNow let's move on to our actual detailed proposal (!):\n\n \n\n1. The Profila Platform today\n\nWith Profila, People can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see \"Illustration 1).\n\nThe Profila platform encompasses two major parts, a mobile app and a web app.\n\nThe mobile app allows the user to interact with remaining parts of the Profila platform. It will be used to set up user preferences, consent configuration, subscriptions to brands, etc. In addition, it will provide to the user access to all the information about all activities associated with Profila platform including which ads they have received, which ads they have interacted with, and videos or photos sent to subscribed brands.\n\nThe Mobile App: A person centric, multi brand experience mobile application that will enabling an individual to:\n\n- Engage with brands and manage own privacy\n\n- Create and selectively share own digital profile\n\n- Get rewarded in cash and brand value\n\nThe Web App: A permission-based relationship for brands with individual customer that will enable to:\n\n- Access evergreen, accurate zero-party data and insights\n\n- Communicate and advertise on a private channel\n\n- Earn attention and deliver true personalization\n\n3. Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - integrating with IOG through ATALA PRISM for our identity management system component\n\nBecause of all these interactions in Profila between people and brands have legal consequences (including the payout to consumers for granting access to their data), we need certainty that the transactions happened between the 2 parties, and that the individual is who he/she says he/she is. We therefore need proof of identity.\n\nTowards the further realization of the Profila platform, Profila is therefore looking to integrate with IOG through ATALA PRISM for the identity management system component. If you want to control your data online and receive (financial) compensation for your data, it is important you can provide proof of your identity. ATALA PRISM is the perfect solution. By integrating ATALA PRISM, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments.\n\nProfila would integrate its platform with IOG identity management system to enable customers owning DID based digital ID and various credentials which will be the base for their communication with brands. The identity management part is needed to incorporate zero knowledge proof, the aspect of enabling an individual to share her/his own data (psychographic, preference, etc.) and contents to brands with the fact that the brand does not know any more details about the individual except that information is of a living person who is uniquely identified by the Profila platform and is used for targeting and advertising purposes.\n\nWe believe that we can use ATALA PRISM for the following capabilities:\n\nDigital ID – one click registration; login; confirmation\n\n        2. Credential management – user owning and sharing credentials\n\n        3. Data privacy management – user exercising legal data subject rights\n\n        4. Document certification (ID documents, legal documents, certifications, KYC, etc)\n\n        5. Data Sharing – user selectively sharing information\n\n        6. Personal Data Vault – user controlling third party access\n\n \n\nThe following use cases are foreseen:\n\nUser registration - As Profila, we need to register any Profila user with digital ID or Physical ID to ensure that he/she is a living person.\n\n2. User identification - As Profila, we need to ensure that all users are cryptographically identified as a unique person so  that no two users with the same identity can register in Profila Platform.\n\n3. User's data sharing (anonymously – OPTION 1) – as a user, I need to be able to choose to disclose only some parts of my profile anonymously to a brand of my choice, and securely share information.\n\n4. User's data sharing (consented, via data subscription – OPTION 2) – as a user, I need to have an option to take my consent for sharing the whole of my profile non-anonymously to a specific brand.\n\n5. Brand advertising - As a brand admin, I need to create a private and secured connection with individual for advertising\n\n***\n\nWhat other challenges are ahead in our \"Zero-knowledge advertising & insights\" development roadmap?\n\nThis ATALA PRISM DID project is only one of the steps into our broader Cardano technology adoption and integration around zero-knowledge advertising and insights, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. \n\nUnder the other funds and challenges, we already have submitted additional project proposals for important other features we want to develop as part of this effort:\n\n- step 1 - personal data license smart contract – under this step, individuals can select to share certain information to with a brand of their choosing and get compensated for it. (see our proposal in fund 6 – \"dapp to control/monetize your data\" - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/366908-48088))\n\n- step 2 - privacy ledger – This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform, which allows users to control their data via legal privacy rights (e.g. right to be forgotten or the right to rectify incorrect data). UPDATE - We have submitted this proposal under the \"metadata challenge\" of FUND 5 and received the first place! #thankyouADAcommunity. See here for our proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088. We will keep you posted on our progress.\n\n- Step 3 - digital ID (for FUND 6) - Atala PRISM implementation – this is the present submission\n\n- step 4 (for FUND 7 or later) - zero-knowledge proofs* - personalized ads with respect of privacy - using zero-knowledge proofs* in order to allow a brand to advertise to the \"perfect\" consumer (meaning to the exact target audience consumer, which exactly matches the specific offering/message a brand wants to share), without sharing ANY personal data with the brand. Stay tuned for more information!   (*Zero knowledge proof is a sort of an approach securing private data, which is through a cryptographic technique that has been used to provide privacy by design in the context of DLT and blockchain. Shortly, zero knowledge proof allows an entity called a prover to argue to another party, called verifier, that a determined statement is true without revealing more information than strictly necessary to convince the truth.)\n\n4. Practical aspects – \"show us the money\" – costs\n\nVia this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our ATALA PRISM DID proof of concept integration. We assess that the creation of such a POC will require at least a budget of 39.650 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 20 days of senior developer (Raja, our CTO) @ 900 USD per day – totaling 18.000 USD\n\n- 25 days of web/backend developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 7.500 USD\n\n- 25 days of app developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 7.500 USD\n\n- 7 days of legal and project management work, including progress reporting (Michiel, general counsel) @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.650 USD\n\n5. Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer\n\nAt the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 6, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.\n\n(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila.\n\nWe have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021 (Q1 2022). According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 by the end of 2022 (by adding more brands).\n\n(2) Geographical focus market? We are launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q3 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).\n\n(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy \"Millennials\" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old) that are ware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it; and \"brand-loyalists\" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).\n\n(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.\n\n(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end of 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).\n\n6. Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)\n\nAs an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:\n\nFirst, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.\n\nSecond, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.\n\nIn addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.\n\nFinally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess (and take feedback) on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.\n\n7. Defining success\n\nThe POC we will develop under this Catalyst fund 6 submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to provide people with control of their data and compensation for their attention. Success of the POC would be that we can integrate it into our existing App with one of the 5 SME brands that are testing, and make sure it works with their consumers. .","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367840-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n.\n\nThe Catalyst School: what is it all about?\n\nThe Catalyst School is a place created to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles. We onboard new members and help improving their skills along the way, in any way they decide to engage with Catalyst: as a Proposer, a Community Advisor, a Veteran Community Advisor or without any specific role within the process. In order for Catalyst to flourish and reach its full potential, all these roles need to give their best contribution within the process.\n\nWe understand that different people prefer different learning methods. Therefore, the School aims to help the community through:\n\nLive sessions and workshops.\n1-to-1 and group support in many different languages.\nInteractive website.\nOther workshops related to Catalyst.\n\nToday, the main topics covered by the Catalyst School today are:\n\nIntroduction to Catalyst\nProposing in Catalyst\nHow to be a Community Advisor\nHow to be a Veteran Community Advisor\n\n \n\nWhat is the School already doing?\n\nThe Catalyst School is already helping the community since the beginning of Fund 6. We are doing that so we can receive feedback from the community and improve our teaching methods and content so we reach the highest Return on Intention we can.\n\nYou can check our announcement during a Catalyst Town Hall here:\n\n\nWe have already run several sessions about the main topics described above, and onboarded more than 200 new Catalyst members.

Therefore, anyone who wants to join this experiment needs to learn about it first.\n\nUntil today, learning about Catalyst, how it works, its requirements and the criteria to succeed according to one's role is still not so easy because the relevant information and resources are not easily digestible and findable, in one hub known to newcomers and veterans alike.\n\nThere is also no platform to bring together those who are in the process of learning about Catalyst, be them newcomers or veterans, so they can exchange knowledge and help each other.\n\n \n\nOur Partnerships\n\nAs the saying goes, if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together! With that in mind, Catalyst School will collaborate with other educational stakeholders in the Catalyst ecosystem, building bridges to maximize synergistic optimum impact.\n\nThe Catalyst School already has partnerships with:\n\nGimbalabs ( https://gimbalabs.com/ )\nWADA ( https://wadalliance.org/ )\nEastern Town Hall ( https://discord.gg/4xnCdV6Qrn )\nTutorial for Community Advisors ( http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBiSh )\n\n \n\nOur basic Website\n\nThe Catalyst School will include a basic website consisting of two main parts:\n\n- Gitbook\n\nAll the content and the resources used for the Catalyst School will be published in a public Git repository with an Open Source license and presented to the users through Gitbook (https://www.gitbook.com/), a platform for publishing documentation.\n\n- Landing page\n\nThe landing page will include:\n\nA subscription form to collect students and engage them with periodical emails and resources\nA visual index to helps users navigating through all the resources published in the GitBook\nA basic quiz about the \"Introduction to Catalyst\"\n\nLink to the Miro Board: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l-LVKTI=/?moveToWidget=3074457362364829276&cot=14\n\n \n\nThe Plan: Roadmap and Milestones\n\nThis proposal aims to provide the School sessions, workshops, 1-to-1/group support (in English) and a basic website. When funded, we will provide all these services for the next 2 Funds (Funds 7 and 8).\n\nSchool Sessions and workshops are planned to be hosted during After Town Halls (every Wednesday) and during Swarm Sessions (every Saturday). Also, the sessions are going to be synchronized with each phase of Project Catalyst, so we increase the value delivered by them.\n\nOur goal is to provide 20 sessions in each Fund, following the Project Catalyst schedule. Therefore, our roadmap (per Fund) is:\n\n \n\n- Week 1 - Insight Sharing Phase:\n\n2 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n\n- Week 2 - Proposal Submission Phase:\n\n2 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n2 x Proposing in Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n\n- Week 3 - Proposal Refinement Phase:\n\n2 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n2 x Proposing in Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n\n- Week 4 - Proposal Finalize Phase:\n\n1 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall)\n2 x How to be a Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n\n- Week 5 - Proposal Assessment Phase:\n\n1 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall)\n2 x How to be a Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n2 x How to be a Veteran Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n\n- Week 6 - Assessments Review Phase:\n\n2 x How to be a Veteran Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)\n\n \n\nBesides that we aim at providing 30 1-to-1/group support sessions in each Fund. Therefore, in total we will provide a total of 60 support sessions. Each support session will be 30 mins long, and we will encourage individuals who ask for support to make it a group support, so more community members can benefit from them.\n\n \n\n-> This road map and sessions/workshops schedule can be adapted and changed based on community feedback and needs.\n\n \n\nTherefore, our milestones and success definition are:\n\n3 months after funded (end of Fund 7):\n\nLearning content created for the School sessions and workshops.\nSchool basic website up and running.\n20 School sessions and workshops hosted.\n30 1-to-1/group supports provided\n\n6 months after funded (end of Fund 8):\n\nFurther 20 School sessions and workshops hosted.\nFurther 30 1-to-1/group supports provided.\n\n \n\nSuccess metrics\n\nWe will track the success of this project by measuring the:\n\nTotal number of community members who get involved with the Catalyst School.\nNumber of proposers joining the sessions and workshops.\nNumber of CAs joining the sessions and workshops.\nNumber of vCAs joining the sessions and workshops.\nNumber of 1-to-1 supports provided to community members.\nNumber of new referees\nNumber of new voters\n\n \n\nThe Team\n\nWe believe that collaboration is the key for the success of Catalyst… and it couldn't be different with this project!\n\nWe are a group of 11 people of diverse backgrounds, but two common passions: Catalyst and education.\n\nGo on and get to know our team:\n\nAlejo Escrivá: Product & Growth Marketing consultor, business analytics MBA, Industrial Designer, and Entrepreneur with 8+ years shaping lovable products and communities.

The first crowdfunding model available will be the rewards category, where the investor receives the product or service in the future.\n\nThe Innovatio Founder would be a private company, which will comply with EU rules and regulations allowing it to offer this service throughout all the EU, enabling the mass adoption of blockchain technology in the European market.\n\n \n\nWhat is Innovatio's vision for the next 5 years?\n\nIn the crowdfunding market, investors can be from anywhere in the world, but not the projects that start their crowdfunding campaign, so Innovatio will start operating in the European Union.\n\nWhile Innovatio is accentuating itself as a crowdfunding platform in the European Union and growing the brand name and community, the intention is to expand licensing in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and APAC.\n\nAs mentioned before, the first funding category is rewards-based, where the project must give a reward in return (product/service/membership/tokens, etc).\n\nInnovatio intends to add different modalities in the future such as equity and debt, this requires another type of license and another type of Smart Contract templates, so the vision is to implement equity in the next 2 years and debt in the next 3 years.\n\nInnovatio's vision for the next 5 years is to be able to operate globally, not including China, allowing projects to start their crowdfunding campaigns under different modalities (Reward/Equity and Debt).\n\n \n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Innovatio Founder is a Crowdfunding platform that allows fundraising campaigns under different crowdfunding modalities, allowing legal entities and DApps to raise funds in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.\n\nThe projects that want to start their Crowdfunding campaign must provide sufficient information to represent the project in a smart contract and a legal document that ensures the investor. In this way, subsequent investors will be clear about the responsibilities and commitments of the campaign.\n\nImplementing the GameChanger Wallet we can facilitate the adoption of the blockchain by the general public, facilitating investments with fiat and cryptocurrency and representing the transactions on the blockchain with meta-data, allowing a transparent and secure tracking of the funds.\n\nWhen a project reaches its fundraising goal, it will start to use the funds raised progressively, fulfilling the milestones previously defined in the legal contract in an audit process between the project and the investors, ensuring the correct use of the funds.\n\nIf a project does not meet a milestone or the funding goal is not achieved, a re-funding to investors will occur in whole or partially.\n\n \n\nWhat is the Innovatio community?\n\nThe Innovatio community is a private initiative that seeks to bring together entrepreneurs and developers from many areas who are interested in using, developing, and implementing blockchain technology in business models, contributing to the adoption of the technology and its visibility.\n\nThe Innovatio community also helps new members outside the blockchain world to get to know the other Catalyst communities, where they can turn to learn or talk about other topics (Governance, Technical Solutions, Workshops, etc.).\n\nAs the community grows, it will migrate to a new website, where the networking and content generated will be easier to consume and share.\n\nThis community is public and the proposals below are to increase the marketing and content developed for it.\n\nWe recommend reading these different proposals that revolve around the community:\n\nProposer outreach: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Crowdfunding-Website-for-Proposals/352260-48088\n\nMultilingual Resources: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Educational-Content-in-a-Single-Web/367666-48088\n\nDLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Entrepreneur-Community-Mentoring/369325-48088\n\n \n\nGeneral Project Catalyst ecosystem issues.\n\n1. Fewer than 12% of proposals presented are funded in each funding round for the limitation of treasury funds.\n\n2. Project Catalyst is not likely to attract mainstream or even cryptocurrency investors.\n\n3. Community focused on educational, technological, and governance development, but with little focus on mass-market adoption and business value.\n\n4. The channels and means to identify co-founders, team members, and users is very limited, hindering the mutual collaboration potential of the community.\n\n5. The community has little reach to people in another ecosystem or outside of the blockchain world.\n\n \n\nHow will The Innovatio Founder benefit the Catalyst ecosystem?\n\n1) The size of the crowdfunding market is 50 billion per year, which would allow you to raise a co-incredible amount of funds, in addition to being able to present your project to fiat investors.\n\n2) The possibility of contributing large amounts of money and transfers to the Cardano ecosystem, thanks to its continuous SWAP of tokens.\n\n3) Financial company pioneer in adopting Cardano technology to implementing investments with crypto and fiat currencies, and securing marketplace investors with smart contracts and meta-data.\n\n \n\nHow will The Innovatio Founder help Entrepreneurs and Developers?\n\n1. Innovatio's brand comes with its public community, which will allow hundreds of developers and entrepreneurs to interact with each other, bringing great creativity and business value to Catalyst.\n\n2. Entrepreneurs and developers who have a project in more advanced stages can focus solely on the business model to raise massive funds.\n\n3. Developers will mainly be able to use and have an official GameChanger Wallet support, as we have a mutual collaboration agreement.\n\n \n\nWhat will the funds from this proposal be used?\n\nIf the proposal is successful in obtaining the requested funds, it will be used to develop a functional MVP within the next 3 months.\n\n¿What does this MVP consist of?\n\n1) User experience on the web for companies and buyers (Profile creation and customization, visualization of crowdfunding campaigns, and pre-draft to start a campaign).\n\n2) Simple and practical creation of an external wallet and connection to the user's account with GameChanger.\n\n3) Smart Contract template with the functionality of raise funds in various cryptocurrencies.\n\n4) Implementation of the audit system for the release of funds raised through milestones.\n\n \n\nFuture implementations:\n\n🔔 Raise funds in fiat currency via debit/credit card.\n\n🔔 Representation of start-ups and investors in the real world (Data-base) and on the blockchain (Digital IDs) with meta-data.\n\n🔔 Legal contract with commitments and responsibilities of the start-ups crowdfunding campaigns stored in the blockchain through meta-data.\n\n \n\nMilestones and Roadmap\n\n✔️ Legal issues in the implementation of blockchain in the fiat/crypto market.\n\n✔️ Architectural solution for the implementation of payment in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies\n\n✔️ Architectural solution for the use of smart contracts and meta-data in the crowdfunding marketplace\n\n✔️ Development of the project's financial and self-sustainability plan.\n\n✔️ Development of a minimalist mock-up of the entire website and publication of the project's website.\n\n✔️ Development of a community focused on entrepreneurs and developers where mutual collaboration and the emergence of new projects are encouraged.\n\n✔️ Development of the architecture and server in Amazon AWS for the deployment of the web and Discord bots.\n\n✔️ Discord Community with more than 300 verified members.\n\n🔔 Final Landing Page Design for MVP Test Registration (coming soon)\n\n🔔 Registered a company in Estonia.

Shared Reality is intended to change that. Part of that is an immutable source of truth, where all controversial documents can be warehoused and available in their original forms, without requiring the public to trust any person or institution. We also need this information to be presented by a distributed front-end which would ensure that the strongest rebuttals and counter-rebuttals are presented where they belong - right next to the assertions that form people's perceptions of reality.\n\n \n\nThe existing information ecosystem allows disinformation to thrive and prevents the public from having effective defenses against disinformation, propaganda, or active measures techniques.\n\n \n\nFor example:\n\n \n\nIt doesn't matter how many people are upset about a prevailing narrative. (For example, whether vaccines do or do not cause autism.) It doesn't matter how upset they are. And, it doesn't matter how much time goes by. They can never take meaningful steps to resolve their discomfort. Their mental health and relationships can suffer.\n\n \n\nAny entity with enough resources can create paralysis on any issue by injecting disinformation into the public mind whenever they see public consensus building against them. Controversies and problems are never resolved. New controversies, also never resolved, are introduced regularly.\n\n \n\nWhen people want to know about climate change, they hear from pundits, magazines, and media conglomerates instead of hearing directly from actual climate scientists. Before the Internet, this made sense. Now, however, it's an outdated, inefficient, costly, and dangerous way to manage an information ecosystem.\n\n \n\nWe are currently living through an information war. Our trust has been very skillfully manipulated over decades in a divide and conquer process called Active Measures (or Ideological Subversion). Either the 2020 US presidential election was stolen or it wasn't. The existing media will not be resolving this controversy. If they were, they would have done it a long time ago. We need new tools to address and resolve this situation, or we can likely expect the worst.\n\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community\n\n\"The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' ... 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do'.\"\n\n- From a George W Bush senior White House aide, in 2004.\n\n \n\nThat does appear to be how it's sorting out. I hope we are all on the same page about that. Competing realities are being manufactured and people are living their lives inside these Big Lies. We need better weapons in the war against disinformation.\n\n \n\nShared Reality will provide the tools the public needs in order to protect itself from the Big Lie and other tactics which are now being used to destabilize Western-style democracies. \n\n \n\nThe key to shifting this paradigm is frictionless, two-way communication between the people who know things and the people who want to know those things - especially across social boundaries (like political party affiliation).\n\n \n\nA centralized version of such a platform can be found in a closed beta state at https://sharedreality.solutions . The missing next features are a blockchain-based data store and distributed front-end. This proposal includes the creation of a read-only front-end for non-authenticated public users.

It's called GameChanger and it's primary goal is to allow people focus on what really matters rather than loose attention on infrastructure, language complexities and high level coding skills requirements.\n\nGameChanger current key features:\n\nLight-client, non-custodial, fully responsive progresive web app (PWA) wallet, ready to be used in any device without installing. Coming from an emerging country, we know that is hard to make users install applications on their phones and even computers when they sometimes won't have storage left or an adecuate and clean environment to install executables.\nMainnet, and Testnet wallet as well to allow developers and students to test without spending real value.\nFirst deeply gamified wallet in the Cardano Ecosystem, where your balance is like a game inventory, and you move assets (coloured cards) as they were tangible objects, allowing you to make the simplest transaction to even multi-asset, multi-output transactions with the same intuitive interface. We are truly unleashing Cardano's potential by allowing even newcomers to send the most advanced transactions with the easiest UI in the ecosystem and breaking more than a decade of inherited UI trends that are inadecuate in front of Cardano capabilities\nNo more manually settings for fees and minimum ADA values, the wallet calculates all this for you. Sending a single token has never been easier, just pick the asset you want to send and the wallet adjusts the rest.\nNative NFT and tokens support with visual representation from day one. Token avatars helps you identify same minting policies to quickly discover fake tokens and visually respect NFTs collection similarities. Token registry verification check.\nStrict audit stage for any transaction sending request, letting the user to review their actions prior sending.\nBuiltin NFT Creator, drag and drop any file type, (not just images) to mint a single NFT or even a profesional collection in an automated way. Make NFT drops with the same gamified UI with final review stage.\nURL-based dApp connector, allowing social networks, blogging sites, landing pages and even emails and e-messaging to carry payment links, donation buttons, metadata, tokens and NFT minting links on Cardano Blockchain. We plan to cover smart contracts and other features soon so please stay tunned.\nHere is a simple \"minter tweet\" to try this out:\nhttps://twitter.com/GameChangerOk/status/1433861451618426880?s=20\nBuiltin Playground (IDE): dApp connector editor and HTML and URL generator. GameChanger Script editor, a JSON-based dApp connector scheme that already has been succesfully coded by non-developers proving that to help developers focus on building, we must simplify our coding languages and tools. Users can start coding this scripts by editing all the demos already integrated in the editor. Implement payments, NFT drops and complex transactions in a couple of minutes ending up with a ready to use autogenerated HTML dynamic dApp integration or a static copy-and-paste URL.\n(e)UTXO model visually exposed, ideally for devs and students to audit and learn how Cardano works. This plus Playground materializes our commitment to students and junior developers.\nCode based on Emurgo's cardano-serialization-lib, the core of Yoroi Wallet.\nPrivate key isolation inside Web Workers, read-only mode, and more.\nOpen source, community driven API backend, using IOHK's cardano-graphql and relying on Dandelion APIs, whom infrastructure efforts has allowed us to put our wallet online because we can't afford our own infrastructure yet as we have been supporting this development with our own savings and the required cloud hosting is very expensive in our country. Because we lack fair infrastructure capabilities and we are a very small team we are working closed source for now looking to reach sustainability first.\n\n \n\nWhy GameChanger:\n\nI believe that Cardano is the real game changer here otherwise I would't choose it to build with, but I must confess I didn't planned to build this wallet at the beginning. I faced a month of language communication issues, lack of documentation, delayed answers, expensive to deploy infrastructure and bugs while trying to build on Cardano. And it's ok, because it's a rising ecosystem and it's totally understandable, I knew soon this would change for good. But I thought it was a shame, so much potential in front of us and I couldn't reach it at the moment. I learned from this and I developed GameChanger to help others focus on materializing their projects on Cardano much much faster and with a smoother experience.\n\n \n\nProposal:\n\nHelp us to prepare ourselves to onboard new users at scale and improve GameChanger Wallet to fully adapt to it's upcoming third party application ecosystem while contributing back to Dandelion APIs to let them help others developers as well with the API's, some of them being developers building dApps with this wallet: A very productive feedback loop.\n\n \n\nProposed plan (5 months of work):\n\nSupport other feedback loops that are in the talks with communities such as Gimbalabs, and individuals, by offering support and adding new frequently requested features.\nAdd smart contracts capabilities\nImprove overall wallet, bug fixing, refactoring.\nAdd more demos to Playground\nDocs, tutorials.\nAdd a Dapp Discovery Hub or Marketplace to make all existing dApps available within the wallet\nPrepare the code for internationalization\nTalks, debates, and educative events side by side with community partnerships such as the one taking place next Tuesday 24/8 on Gimbalabs Discord\nGrow user base by reaching potencial users/startups and try to cover their needs\nCover for 1 year our own infrastructure costs while also contributing to Dandelion APIs to potenciate a feedback loop and with a stronger infrastructure help them and us onboard more developers with the open source APIs.\n\n \n\n \n\nBudget breakdown:\n\nLead, Fullstack Dev + support for dApp teams 400hs x $40 $16000\nSys.

Talks and new feature support with third party dApp teams will be taking place. DApps will be integrated already using what's available for them, helping the Cardano dev ecosystem to grow, easing the learning/developing curve on tasks like payments,NFTs drops, token issuing, metadata, payments on marketplaces, passwordless logins powered by Cardano, etc.   \nAfter 6 months AC (After Catalyst): Proposed development will be finished, some new features implemented to allow better dApp integrations, all backend infrastructure will be online, many dApps will be using GameChanger already, growing Cardano ecosystem even more. Smart contracts will be added to the feature list, allowing a wave of new dApp teams to join the ecosystem.\nAfter 12 months: dApp discovery hub will be populated with real use-cases on Cardano, a user-base will be formed and the ecosystem will have months of grow, moving ahead to new ideas and challenges to make it bigger.\n\n \n\nOther proposals that would need this one for scaling, quality and new feature set:\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/GameChanger-IPS-Program/370237-48088\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Easy-Use-and-Wallet-Implementation/369529-48088\n\n \n\nThanks for your time.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367709-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe Crazy Startup is a unique interaction between digital assets, media, and community ownership which has never been tried before.\n\nWe are building the first \"Media Backed Decentralised Accelerator\" in the world.\n\nOur VISION is to shine a spotlight on some of the world's most exciting startups and allow the viewers to learn and engage with the entrepreneurs, while our MISSION is to democratise investments in startups and make them accessible to everyone.\n\nThe next steps for the show\n\nNovember 2021 to 31st January 2022 - Startups will be able to apply\n\n28th of February - We will announce the 60 best startups\n\nMarch - Pitch day (60 Startups) and the public will be able to vote\n\n23rd of March we will announce the 12 best ones\n\nApril - The Reality Show/Accelerator will start\n\n \n\nSupport from the Mayor\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1678630072325774&id=284122375109891&sfnsn=scwshmo\n\n \n\nWe have a few interesting strategic partners that cannot be mentioned just yet!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367436-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nVision\n\nSpark a new economic paradigm by tokenizing all parts of production chains.\n\n \n\nMission\n\nBuilding the first decentralized industrial network to replace and disrupt a historical exploitative industry with a decentralized and democratic network that incorporates all African producers. This allows them the participation in efficient and transparent value chains to produce at scale for the global market.\n\n \n\n \n\nMotivation\n\nWe believe in an Africa where everyone has the opportunity to fulfill their personal potential, where everyone can have access to a stable income and growth opportunities. We believe that African economies can grow and prevent mistakes the rest of the world has committed, while building a livelihood for millions of Africans.\n\nWe have observed a pattern in the way many African economies are built: The number of formal jobs is limited, so many people turn to run their own small or micro business, often in light manufacturing such as tailoring, carpentry, or else. However, because of a lack of formal education and professionalism, these small businesses only serve the limited domestic market, lack access to capital, and usually do not grow. This is especially evident in the fashion industry. It is the second-largest employer in Africa, but exports from African countries are just a tiny fraction of the global fashion exports.\n\nWe believe that this is a huge opportunity – all the resources are already there, they just need to be organized in a better way. With Cardano, we want to make these value chains transparent and efficient and give millions of small businesses access to the global market, as well as the tools to supply it. We aim to create a network that creates incentives to participate, trust and invest in the growth of Africa locally and globally.\n\n \n\nModel\n\nManufacturing is the only way to create necessary jobs and enable economic growth in Africa. We decided to start with the fashion industry.\n\nThe African continent is naturally decentralized, and imposing centralized industries will repeat all the suffering we can observe in textile production hubs of the world. Imposing centralized structures might also damage many of the natural advantages the African continent has.\n\nThanks to blockchain, those mistakes can be avoided. The Waya model builds on existing small businesses in the fashion industry and organizes them in a decentralized production system. By aligning incentives and creating a clear path to grow a production business, we open the way to an alternative model of industrialization.\n\nThis alternative model of industrialization is transparent, democratic, fair, and makes every participant a beneficiary of the overall growth.\n\n \n\nHow do we do this?\n\nAccess to market\n\nThe production of a garment is a complex task that includes designing, product development, and sewing, pattern making, fabric sourcing, tailoring, printing, packaging, and shipping. The Waya platform streamlines these production steps and makes it easy for international labels to produce clothing in Africa.\n\nUsing Cardano, we can decentralize and organize all these tasks transparently so that small businesses in Africa can take them up. Furthermore, the platform is an aggregator of production capacities. We can split tasks, i.e. divide 5000 pieces into five tailor shops when they only have a capacity of 1000. This way, we provide fashion production at the click of a button while creating value in Africa. Small African businesses can access orders, including the global market's instructions, capital, and materials on their phone. \n\nAccess to working capital\n\nWe want African businesses to grow within the network, take up big orders, and reward consistent high standards. That requires working capital. Because of our knowledge regarding the performance of businesses, we can determine a credit rating. This credit ranking is the basis of the platform's internal lending scheme. By providing capital to trustworthy partners, we bridge the funding gap many businesses in Africa struggle with while also fueling the growth of our network.\n\nA transparent and effective value chain\n\nSupply chains in Africa are usually peer to peer and informal. This often leads to higher prices and less efficient systems. We think that decentral value chains have big advantages too such as flexibility and robustness. With the help of Cardano, we can preserve those advantages and eliminate the disadvantages. We map out every part of the supply chain to make it transparent, efficient, and resulting in cheaper products.\n\n \n\nImplementation\n\nFor multiple reasons blockchain is the superior operating system for global and socially ambitious business ventures – and Cardano appears to be by far the cleanest implementation of that vision. Processing payments as well as orchestrating the shipping of real goods and user data at scale – and maybe more importantly, subject to complex and ever-growing business logic - sounds like a nightmare if it were to be handled in the traditional way, meaning: Centralized servers, expensive payment service providers, swathes of papers crossing jurisdictions. While those problems won't magically disappear, a DAO as the heart piece allows pushing the risky bits to the edges - allowing the whole system to at some point spread like ivy over the globe, unbeholden to contingent pettiness of singular fiefdoms.\n\nWe devised a somewhat complex scheme – a \"game\" if you will – to ensure the correct functioning of each part of the production process. Since we are already experienced working with Plutus (see mirqur.io - a DEX on Cardano) as well as all the other common constituents of the tech-stack – web-dev, app-dev, backend, even data science and AI (https://gitlab.com/fthagn) – there is no way we can not build something truly beautiful here. \n\n \n\nDefinition of success after 3, 6, and 12 months\n\nProgress made so far\n\nWe have…\n\nproduced a basic clothing line with Ugandan producers\nbuilt relationships with textile producers in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania\nbuilt a database of 50 different African fabrics\ntalked sustainability and fairness focused labels and found out what they need and want\nacquired two customers and are currently fulfilling orders for 5 products\nbuilt agreed partnerships with 2 Ugandan producers\nbuilt a strong advisory board\ndeveloped a website and working on an online tool for fashion labels to post orders which the producers can easily fulfill\nbuilt a local team of employees in Uganda\n\n3-month milestones\n\nHaving successfully produced and sold 500 pieces\nLaunch ordering tool\nTotal of 10 collectives on board\nExplore garment producers in 2 more countries and adding 30 more fabrics to the database\nBuilding of the training program & laying ground to onboard new collectives\n\n6-month milestones\n\nHaving successfully produced and sold 1000 pieces\nBuilt the DApp and blockchain representation\nTotal of 15 collectives on board\n\n12-month goals\n\nSuccessfully producing and selling 500 pieces monthly\nOnboarding 50 more collectives\nCollectives registered on blockchain\nPayment over DApp\nMVP of NFT model for fashion designers to publish their patterns\n\n \n\nLaunch date\n\n1st December 2021\n\n \n\nAbout us\n\nFounders\n\nAntonia Lorenz\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/antonia-lorenz/\n\nAntonia is an entrepreneur at heart and very passionate about all of her endeavors.

Hiatt\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-m-hiatt-880187187/\n\nBesides being a computer scientist by trade, cognitive systems and the way society organizes itself in form of various games have always fascinated Chris. Also, he was always annoyed by involuntary waste of human potential. It is not surprising that this resulted in him becoming passionate about smart contracts, which are a computational way to re-organize society from the ground up and lower the barrier of entry to superorganism-inception by orders of magnitude, thus posing a challenge to incumbents. Waya constitutes his second project on the Cardano blockchain, after the Mirqur-exchange.\n\nCarolin Baltzer\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/carolin-baltzer/\n\nCarolin is our numbers expert.

But securing debt funds to escalate our loans to more people and geographies is our next challenge. We are Cardano advocates for a while ago and MELD inspired us to leverage stake pools engagement for a higher purpose while making a good investment for ADA holders.\n\nWith this pilot, we want to test our hypothesis that we can engage ADA holders to stake with us and achieve the goal of limitless funding for our micro-credits because without the collaboration of the ecosystem this wouldn't be feasible.\n\n \n\nDeliverables:\n\n1. To validate the engagement of the Cardano community with our project, we will create and evaluate the performance of two stake pools:\n\n- One stake pool with 100% rewards support\n\n- One stake pool with 50% rewards support\n\nDeadline: 1 month from funding.\n\n \n\n2.

The global economy was an estimated $84 Trillion in 2020, (*1) with North America only contributing a fraction of the total. (*2)\n\nEvidence\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2012/10/04/tech/mobile/africa-mobile-opinion/index.html, https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-07-19/more-chinese-use-internet-mobile-phones-computers, https://medium.com/seedstars/mobile-and-internet-penetration-in-latin-america-part-1-541b8947b3f4, *1 https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/, *2 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO\n\nWe will create a base level app infrastructure that can easily conform to the basic needs of an enterprise grade app capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of users using the latest technology like GraphQL, React Native and TypeScript. This will expedite the time to market for many projects in development for Cardano. Our first partnership will be with a ticket sales and exchange platform that is also separately seeking funding in this round.\n\nWe will leverage many open source technologies to build a flexible application framework to help teams deploy their applications on mobile devices and reach the billions of people who only have internet access via a mobile device. This will free up resources for many existing projects to focus on smart contracts and web clients while driving adoption for all.\n\nThe entirety of the funding will go towards supporting the development of this project, by hiring ~3 frontend mobile developers who will work remotely for a duration of 1 year. Any excess funding will be used to pursue partnerships with additional projects and to support a coordinator role between the mobile app developers and dapp developers.\n\nRoadmap:\n\n1 month: Begin scaffolding out the base layer app, with considerations for an enterprise grade environment, such as staging/production/mock environments, authentication and navigation.\n\n3 month: By the end of month three, we will have developed a modular and flexible component library without any strong design decisions so that it can be extended for a variety of brand needs and use cases in the future.\n\n6 month: In 6 months time we will have integrated the components into the first version of the application for our first dapp partner (a ticket marketplace), set up continuous deployment and integration, and ship the first version of the client to the iOS and Android app stores. We will also have extended the basic architecture of the app for considerations such as accessibility, integrated it with the backend services to talk to the smart contracts and communicate data between the client and the server.\n\n12 months: By month 12 we will have iterated and expanded on the initial design and feature set of the first partner app (ticket marketplace), as well as expanded documentation for the basic application framework and component library, including providing an open source repository for other Cardano Dapp projects to leverage to get their project on mobile quicker. Important to note is the same basic app architecture can also be used to make native apps on apple WatchOS, macOS, Windows, and a variety of smart TV operating systems such as Samsung Tizen and AndroidTV. It will also support reverse compiling into web apps, allowing teams to potentially use just one code base to ship a native client to almost any operating system widely used today. The first app should launch around June 2022, with the open source framework being available to others by December 2022.\n\nSuccess for this project will be to partner with at least one existing Cardano project and working with them to bring a mobile application to market (we already have identified a potential initial partner, a ticket marketplace and exchange, which is also seeking funding in this round), while creating a basic framework that can be reused for other partners in the future. Our primary KPI will be to release one well-designed, accessible, performant and user-friendly cross-platform (iOS and android) app for a partner Dapp project. Our secondary KPI will be to form a second partnership and develop documentation for other projects to easily leverage the work we have done, by open-sourcing the foundation of the initial app to bring subsequent projects to market on iOS and android quicker and more easily, with many edge cases and enterprise production environment considerations already handled. We expect the secondary KPI to be hit in the 12 month timeframe, after we successfully ship version one of the first partner project. We believe this will impact the Cardano ecosystem by removing much of the redundant work required to make an enterprise grade native mobile client application, helping the ecosystem to be reached by more people, with more projects much faster. By leveraging our experience to provide this foundation to others we can grow the community faster and provide higher quality mobile apps as an ecosystem with less total resources.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367403-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367486-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nOverview\n\nProposals should have a completion report so that the community is more aware of when a proposal finished the work they were funded for. Thus, the community can review the impact the completed proposal had. The report should look at what the proposals aimed to execute, what ended up being executed and the results of that execution with any learnings that the community may benefit from.\n\nThis proposal is a follow on from the following fund 5 proposals - improve proposal data https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The enriched proposal data from these fund 5 proposals will be made available in an open source repository that anyone can fork and consume for their own projects. This proposal for proposal completion reports will build on top of that data set and produce more data for that repository that will get updated through the projectcatalyst.org community site.\n\nA completion report for each funded proposal will help to make the auditing of funded proposals more efficient and transparent as it will provide the community with information on what funded proposals were delivering for the funded amount. The reports will be publicly available and attached to the proposal data. This will help with any auditing of what has happened in that proposal and also help guide whether the community will want to fund the proposal team for other proposals in the future.\n\n \n\nDesign\n\nCheck the attachments for a design mockup. This design is just to give an idea of what it could look like though please note that both how its executed and the design may change closer to implementation as we think about the solution more!\n\n \n\nDevelopment steps\n\n- Collaborate with IOG and the community to confirm the completion report details that should be included when a proposal team has finished allocating their funds.\n\n- Create a form on the proposal page to allow proposers to indicate they have completed a proposal and to fill in the relevant details on what was completed and the return on intention for the community to have access to.\n\n- Render the completion report on the proposal pages that proposers have added and also provide a way for the community to filter all proposals based on the ones which have been completed.\n\n- Implement adding the completion report to the open source proposal data repository so everyone will have access to completion reports for any given proposal to use as needed.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nGetting existing proposal information into an open source repository will the pre-requisite to this proposal which involves completing fund 5 funded proposals for improving proposal information https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The data model for completion reports and functionality should take around 3 weeks to complete, further work is likely needed depending on whether IOHK has been recording this information. If so we will take that information and add it to existing data, if not then we will be looking to reach out to previous funded proposals to complete the completion report so the community has the data. In either event that manual work will likely take around 3 weeks to complete. Please note we would not expect to get complete coverage of creation of historic completion reports in that time frame if we had to reach out to previous funded proposals - it would be a best efforts situation which is naturally based off the responsiveness of the previously funded proposers. For future proposals we would push for it to become part of the process. In total the proposal should take around 6 weeks to complete.\n\n- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.\n\n- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.\n\n- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed\n\n \n\nFeasibility\n\n- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps & Darlington has 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Between us we covers the skills needed to draft out a sensible data model, make it easy to gather the data and host that in a public API for the community. \n\n \n\nImpact\n\n- Effective auditable information - By knowing which proposals are completed and whether they are executed successfully will help to give the community a good indication on the amount of proposals that are completed, how long they take on average to finish and what percentage of work planned to be completed actually gets executed.\n\n- Inform future voting - All of completion report data will give auditable information mentioned previously that will help improve future voting based off how much impact each funded proposal made when they completed their proposal.\n\n- Usage across tools - Public access to this the completion report information should help to allow different types of tooling to emerge such as analytic dashboards or more in depth reports and reviews on different proposals in the ecosystem. The better the data quality and easier it is to access the more likely the community is to create different tools - especially ones concerning auditing!\n\n \n\nAuditability\n\n- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.\n\n- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst\n\n- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e\n\n- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\n \n\nSuccess metrics\n\n- Increasing voter awareness of completion reports - For a completion report to be truly effective it will be important that voters are aware of it when voting for the same teams again in future funding rounds. This report along with any other proposal data will provide effective auditing of the impact of the proposal that can be compared with other potential proposals when deciding which should be funded.

Another metric to follow is the number of tools like a voter tool that incorporate this information into their own tools.\n\n \n\nWhat success looks like\n\nThe success of this proposal will be providing an effortless way for proposers to add a completion report to their proposal once they have completed allocating their funds.

Whoever has money in Bitcoin is not for anything else, only because there is a massive belief that Bitcoin will hold a certain price in the future.\n\nMany will say that for reservation or transfer of value we can use ADA, and that's the way it is, in the same way that any other token can be used. The problem is that ADA is not perceived as digital gold, unlike Bitcoin which is. Although we know that there is no inconvenience to use it as such, people and institutions only recognize Bitcoin as hard money, this can be solved with this proposal.\n\nThere is a niche for a new digital gold to compete against Bitcoin, due to this it is necessary to create an alternative within the Cardano ecosystem that can do so.\n\n \n\nSOLUTION: Create a Bitcoin substitute on Cardano\n\nMaybe someone does it in some network other than Cardano, or maybe all networks do it after we do it, who knows?\n\nWe will face this question by creating a native token, minted in one go and without any kind of complication, this simple and effective question compromises the dominance that Bitcoin has around the world, possibly relegating it in second place.\n\nLike a lollipop stick someone put there so kids wouldn't get their fingers dirty when eating candy, Hard Blue doesn't integrate vast complexity, but it does bring something with the potential to alter Bitcoin's place in favor of Cardano.\n\nBy now you can imagine some of the benefits this would have for future Hard Blue holders. Apart from all the improvements that Cardano can implement, if the security of Bitcoin is compromised, the user has another option where to diversify their capital, of course more transactions per second, a lower consumption and low commissions.\n\nNot every Bitcoin holder has security or decentralization requirements such as Bitcoin offers, many may wish to safeguard value in another network that provides other characteristics. Competition gives people the opportunity to choose an alternative more appropriate to their interests, that is why there are people who open a bakery on the same street that there is already another, the most competitive of these businesses absorbs the customers of the most inefficient company forcing them to disappear, to diminish its influence or to become more competitive. This scenario is the one proposed by Hard Blue.\n\nThe monetary expansion diverted from fiat money by the governments of the world will be the cause of high inflation that will attract people and institutions to keep part or almost all of their capital in cryptocurrencies that have the characteristics of non-inflationary money such as Bitcoin or Hard Blue.\n\nI propose the promotion of a digital gold to replace Bitcoin, a hard money called Hard Blue.\n\n \n\nPhases\n\nThe project consists of 3 phases:\n\n1 - Initial diffusion (for which we request funds; duration 90 days)\n\n2 - Mass diffusion\n\n3 - Consolidation\n\nWith the first phase we will get information on how to deploy the way to promote this proposal in the second phase, we will also be able to see the level of acceptance it has by the masses and an estimate of the percentage of people who are willing to change partially or all of their Bitcoin by Hard Blue. These questions may be presented as surveys in the same diffusion process.\n\nWe will consider this proposal a success if we perceive an acceptance from the public above 50%.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nThe project featured here is Hard Blue and we are requesting funding for an outreach campaign.\n\nThe funds required for a sufficiently relevant diffusion campaign to publicize Hard Blue on social networks and thus see its impact are detailed below:\n\n- 90 days of Twitter advertising with a budget of $150 per day (90 days * $150 = $13,500)\n\n- 90 days of advertising through Google Ads with a budget of $120 per day (90 days * $120 = $10,800)\n\n- 90 days of advertising through Coinzilla with a budget of $120 per day (90 days * $120 = $10,800)\n\n- 15 specific advertisements made every 6 days for 90 days through different advertising media with a promotion budget of $235 per day. (15 days * $235 = $3,525)\n\n$13,500 + $10,800 + $10,800 + $3,525 = $38,625\n\n$38,625 is what is necessary for the completion of phase 1.\n\nYou will have doubts as to why we omitted other equally relevant mediums of communication. The final intention of the advertising action is to finally cover most of the relevant media to publicize Hard Blue in a massive way, however these diffusion options will be integrated as the project is promoted in its phase 2.\n\nI want to clarify that the funds assigned to Hard Blue will not be used at any time to pay salaries or remuneration to the team, absolutely all funds issued in Fund 6 will be used for advertising and promotion of the Hard Blue project, as detailed above.\n\nI greatly appreciate the time you have spent reading this proposal.\n\nA respectful greeting to the entire community.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367065-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nPlease follow the website link for an in-depth proposal.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367124-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n1.

If there was a tool that guided new entrepreneurs through the entire process - from the moment of creating an idea, to the execution of your funded proposal - then it would be much more appealing. The best way to accomplish this is through \"visual work routines\".\n\nA routine is the process for completing a specific task. A work routine completes productive tasks, such as creating a business outline, deciding on a budget, and generating a proposal. A visual work routine is an interactive tool that guides users through the process of completing a task, with descriptions and guides along every step of the way.

This music player will look like any other music player (Spotify, Tidal, etc.), but work entirely different \"under the hood\", using blockchain technology. This means that fans can simply sign into our player using their digital wallet and - through the magic of crypto - pay per stream to play their favorite records. Paid directly to the artists.\n\nDSPs like Spotify pay artists an average of $.003 per play (some artists get paid much less). Statistics show that the average person is spending 4 hours per week streaming music. If 3 minutes per song, that's only 320 songs per month. That would come out to about $0.96 cents per month if paying per stream. The consumer would have to play music for over two weeks straight (3,333 songs), to warrant paying a $9.99 monthly subscription. With our blockchain-enabled music player, we can simultaneously increase an artist's earnings while saving fans money, by removing these middle men. Fans save by only paying when they play music. At fractions of a penny per play. And because the fan is able to make payment via cryptocurrency, the artists will be paid directly, immediately.\n\nWe'll also bring back the concept of the \"album sale\". Streaming services decimated the days when people used to buy albums. Now, with NFTs and smart contract technology, fans can purchase albums in order to download the music, and to access the additional content. Artists can now include many additional novel incentives for album purchases. Fans who support these NFT albums can buy, sell, trade & collect their favorite artist's NFT albums, and unlock artist-created perks for doing so. While still allowing more casual fans to simply continue paying per play.\n\nDSPs like Spotify need centralized servers to hold their massive directories of music and allow its access to their users, but they cost millions of dollars per month to maintain. This adds overhead that ultimately eats away the artist's profit. \"Seeders\" are people who have been facilitating the download of illegal content via peer-to-peer networks since the Napster & Limewire days, unpaid. Using this same concept, we will create a decentralized server, with seeders who will then get paid to maintain access to every song on the platform for our users. The hundreds of millions of dollars in server fees are now covered by our listener's transaction fees to stream these songs. Anyone can become a seeder by opting in, and listening and downloading the songs. Effectively, the seeder is a miner on the blockchain. My hypothesis is that by compensating the seeder for what they do anyway, we will reduce the availability of online pirated content, and unlock latent income that could never be realized before. I believe this idea can be transformative. A music player powered by the community of music lovers.\n\nFor the record labels, the artists, and all parties contractually involved with the making of a song, through NFTs and smart contract technology, they can now get paid automatically, instantly. This detangles an expensive and lengthy process that takes 6-12 months to get paid, traditionally, and sees publishing companies also take their share of fees from artists for tracking and processing these royalty payments.  My plan will effectively cut out multiple middle men, primarily the DSP (Spotify, Tidal, etc). as well as the music publisher (ASCAP, BMI, etc), resulting in cheaper server costs, the degeneration of availability of online pirated content, and allow the record label and the artist to transact directly with their fans.\n\n \n\nIt is the Cardano's mission to bring its technology to Africa. To \"connect the unconnected\" and \"bank the unbanked\". The lack of access to technology in Africa limits the success of African music. This despite global demand, as evidenced by African artists like Wizkid, who just became the first African artist to go platinum in America. Hip Hop music has had a profound economic impact on black communities here in America and the same can hold true for these African communities because of the global demand for African music. This applies to Latin artists in South & Central America, as well. In fact, this technology can grant artists access to a global network of fans, impacting these artists and their communities financially across the globe.\n\nI believe due to the aforementioned effects on online piracy, the reinvention of \"the album\", the streamlining of the industry's royalty payment system, and true access to music globally, that we can bring back music revenues to the pre-Internet days. As confidence in the blockchain grows, and millions of fans are funneled into this peer-to-peer music player, artists will be paid much more fairly, and the value of ADA will rise.\n\nWith the money used to fund this project, I will hire developers to help me build this.  I've already been speaking to a few developers competent in Cardano & Haskell.  The quote to develop an MVP is around $30k. You help me build this, and I will make this the way we play music in the future. On Cardano.\n\n3 month goal - Launch MVP.  We already have two major labels interested in using this technology. We'll present, iterate, and build based on their feedback. My friend doesn't start his role as the CEO & Chairman of one of these major labels until Jan 2022, so we have time.\n\n6 month goal - We'll be streaming albums from our major label beta testers and fine tuning the system. \n\n12 month goal - After validating the system with a handful of record labels, now we expand to the parent corporation's umbrella of record labels and really scale this thing up. \n\nI've also included a link to my company deck with some of my experience.  Thanks for your time.\n\n \n\nUPDATE: (8/25) I've already gotten a verbal commitment to test this from the next CEO of a legendary major record label.  We discussed all the finer points and in the end, he expressed interest in using such a powerful piece of software. We even went as far as to discuss his record label's upcoming release schedule, in which he name dropped several projects we could potentially lead with. \n\nSECOND UPDATE: (8/27) Successfully recruited a Cardano developer, Myles Gámez, who was one of the first graduates of the Plutus Pioneer program. I added him as a Co-Submitter. \n\nTHIRD UPDATE: (9/2) So we've finally put together a complete blueprint for developing this project.  According to our lead developer, it will take about 2 months of development work, and $30k to develop.  \n\n \n\nAs you can see by the updates, I am not waiting for funding to proceed with this project.  We will make this happen.  But I hope to have the community's support.  If you've read this far, Thank you.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367977-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWhat's doing Innovatio?\n\nInnovatio is developing a P2P Crowdfunding platform, which would allow projects within and outside the blockchain ecosystem to submit crowdfunding campaigns under different funding modalities and receive investments in fiat currency and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Innovatio Founder platform uses blockchain technology to solve and improve the following processes:\n\nThe investments received are managed in a disintermediated way through smart contracts, providing total transparency in the movements made\n\nInnovatio's marketplace crowdfunding campaigns have legal and blockchain representation in parallel.

Extension of collaborative network with government agencies around the world generating greater adoption and implementation with governmental and regulatory agreements.\n\n \n\nHow we will achieve this proposal?\n\nInnovatio has the legal advice of a law firm specialized in the implementation of blockchain in financial services such as LimeChain and LimeLegal.\n\nIn this way, we have ensured that we know the licenses and regulations necessary to operate in the European Union market with the implementation of Smart Contracts and meta-data.\n\nThese firms have specialized lawyers in the field throughout the world, being a high-value partner in the expansion of the platform's service to other jurisdictions.\n\n \n\nWhat KPIs measure success?\n\n1) Agreements for the implementation of blockchain technology in services provided by state or provincial governments.\n\n2) Creating legal frameworks in conjunction with government agencies for the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\n3) Agreements with official development and education organisms for the implementation and development of blockchain technology.\n\n \n\nBreakdown Budget\n\nNecessary licenses to operate the Crowdfunding platform with blockchain technology in the European market: $20.000\n\n \n\nSocial Networks\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InnovatioGroup\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InnovatioFounder\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/innovatiofounder\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/tcrdaytKDg\n\nSpanish Telegram Group: https://t.me/innovatiofinderesp\n\nEnglish Telegram Group: https://t.me/innovatiofindereng","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368059-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nBefore going into our detailed proposal, we included a short summary on the (i) team, (ii) the cardano adoption in the next 3/6 months; (iii) a summary of our existing product in which we will insert the POC under this fund, (iv) a short explanation of this proposal, and (v) what 3-6-12 months success looks like.\n\nTeam – We have a versatile team with experience in blockchain projects that is able and committed to tackle this challenge within the budget proposed.\n\n     Michiel Van Roey – tech and privacy lawyer https://www.linkedin.com/in/michielvanroey/\n\n     Rajasekaran Yogarajah – senior developer (in plutus pioneer program) https://www.linkedin.com/in/life-artist/\n\n     Luke Bragg – product architect - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasbragg/\n\n     Ipek Sahiner – senior engineer in tech industry https://www.linkedin.com/in/ipeksahinerschlecht/\n\n     Shawn Jensen https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnj/\n\nCardano adoption and impact in the next 6 months – We already have a finished mobile application (2 years in development) to integrate this Fund 6 NFT in and are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected by Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6).\n\nShort summary of the Profila app (as testing ground for the NFT POC) – Profila is a platform (mobile IOS/Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call \"Brands\") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance.\n\nPeople can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) their personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see \"Illustration 1).\n\nNFT use case summary – Our proposed NFT business model relates to constructive customer feedback and creative customer content, shared by people with brands.\n\nEach time you use the Profila app to share with a specific brand of your choose your feedback or self-created content about their products or services (by sending in a picture, video or text via our existing \"consumer moments\" functionality), you can do so (1) privately for only the brand to see and respond to (option 1), or (2) you can choose to \"create an NFT\" representing your content, making it \"tradeable\" (option 2).\n\nIf you choose to create an NFT, it will be available to Brands for more elaborate use. By offering your content as an NFT, you invite a brand to use your consumer-created content in their commercial business (e.g. to publish on their website as example to other customer, or to integrate it into their marketing content). If the brand values your customer feedback (either for internal use or for public commercial use), they can compensate you for it by acquiring the NFT.\n\nOption 1 is already possible today (=private). We want to develop the NFT functionality under this challenge.\n\nSuccess after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be the end of the NFT development. Success after 6 months would be the integration of this NFT functionality POC into our existing app and first test with our existing customer. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of the NFT POC, used for each data subscription between a person and a brand on Profila. \n\n*********************************************************************************\n\nNow let's move on to (detailed) proposal (!):\n\n1.       The market explained – disconnect between brands and people (see illustration)\n\n\"80% of companies think they deliver great customer experience, but only 8% of customers agree\"\n\nAccording to a report by Bain & Company in 2019, 80% of companies think they deliver a great customer experience, but only 8% of customers agree. This shows a large disconnect between brands and consumers, even though companies have never had as much data about us as today. You would think that with all the data a brand collects about you, they know what you like and how you like to be approached. This is clearly incorrect.\n\nThe reason for this disconnect is partially due to the fact that the brand-to-consumer relationship goes in one direction. Brands decide (i) when to contact you (+frequency), (ii) via which channel, and (iii) the content you receive. You do not have an easy way to influence this process, nor to feedback to a brand what you like.\n\nWe can illustrate this by an example, most of you must have already experienced: you made an online Wholefoods-account to order some groceries but you now get 15 newsletters/week, and your social media feed is full of adds from Wholefoods of products that you either already bought, or that don't relate to you. You buy a pair of Nike sneakers on Amazon, and Nike will start sending you emails for other running shoes in the weeks thereafter, even though you have clearly no more need for running shoes.\n\nEach day, you interact with digital services and purchase products from Brands globally. With each interaction you freely share your personal data with companies which then get used by these brands as they please. But what can you do if brands use your data against your expectations, and how do you keep track of how a brand uses your personal data? How do you tell them what you think/want, and make them listen to you + take action?\n\nToday, there is no effective and easy feedback loop. The only consumer feedback that a brand listens to is often the negative kind, where you threaten them on a public forum and shame them into listening to you if they crossed the line, or if their product/service is underperforming.\n\nWe believe there is room for a 2-way street, where consumers get an easy channel to communicate their (positive and negative) sentiment to brands, privately, 1-1, and where brands can view consumer content and timely respond.\n\nThe advantages for brands are clear. Customer feedback helps brands create a better customer experience, improve their products and services, improve their customer retention, helps brands make better business decisions, etc.\n\n2.      Profila today - the existing consumer App – our \"consumer moments\" and \"brand moments\" functionality\n\nVia our Profila platform, we are redefining the brand-to-consumer relationship by making it a 2-way street, where both parties can (for now) privately share feedback and content.\n\nProfila is a platform (mobile IOS/Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call \"Brands\") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance.\n\nPeople can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) their personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see \"Illustration 1).\n\nA very important feature of Profila – which is crucial for our NFT business case (see point 3 \"Profila tomorrow – consumer feedback via NFTs\"), is called the \"consumer moment\". Consumer Moments are a great way to capture your sentiments anytime, on any topic, and share content or feedback with a specific brand. A Consumer Moment is a photo or video that you can create and share in Profila, to which you can attach a comment and/or an emoji to express your thoughts and sentiment. Consumer Moments are one of the best ways that you can share your opinions directly with a Brand, in a private 1-1 manner.\n\nLet's clarify this by an example of a GOOD EXPERIENCE You are and have always been a Nike fan. You have had your favorite pair of Nike running shoes for many years and are now looking to replace them. This is a perfect moment to share this with Nike and you take one last picture of your (now very worn out) Nike shoes, asking Nike for suggestions on a new pair (see the first app image on the picture we attached \"Consumer Moments – including NFT button\").\n\nOnce you capture the Consumer Moments, you can take the following actions to add relevance to the picture or video:\n\n- tag it to an industry \"category\" (e.g. you can tag the category \"Adventure\" or \"sports\" or \"fashion\" because it relates to shoes);\n\n- tag a relevant Brand (e.g. tag \"Nike\" if you want Profila to send the content to Nike);\n\n- add sentiment to it (e.g. a smiley face emoticon or thumbs up).\n\nOnce you are ready, you can send it directly to the Brand, who will be able to respond directly to your shared Consumer Moment, so you know that your feedback – good or bad – is being heard. Nike seems to appreciate your picture and responds with a new pair of Nike running shoes that they have available in your size (see the last app image on the picture we attached \"Consumer Moments – including NFT button\").\n\nThis scenario also works for a BAD EXPERIENCE. If you bought your expensive Nike running shoes and they break on day 1; you can also take a picture or make a video, add a negative/unhappy emoticon, clarify you just bought them, and send it off to Nike for urgent feedback and restitution.\n\n**important practical remark: if Nike is already a Profila customer and uses the Profila web portal, these customer moments can be viewed in the brand dashboard and Nike can respond to them in Profila by sending its own Brand moments. If however Nike is not (yet) a customer of Profila, we will send positive Consumer Moments to their customer feedback channel, and negative Consumer Moments to their claims/complaints channel.\n\n3.      Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - implementing an NFT option into the consumer feedback moments, making them \"tradeable\"\n\nOur proposed NFT business model relates to constructive customer feedback and creative customer content, shared by people with brands, via our Consumer Moments functionality.\n\nUnder the Catalyst project fund 6, we want to transform our existing Customer Moments functionality to include a \"create an NFT\" button – called \"tradeable\" (see the second app image on the picture we attached \"Consumer Moments – including NFT button\"), so that you can choose to have your customer feedback and content displayed into an NFT platform. Brands can access this platform (in the Profila web portal) to get valuable feedback from their customer, and even use some creative content in their business activities. By acquiring the NFTs, a brand would compensate you as an individual for sharing valuable data which they in turn can use to optimize their products and overall business (or even include it in their marketing).\n\nEach time you use the Profila app to share with a specific brand of your choose your feedback or self-created content about their products or services (by sending in a picture, video or text), you can do so (1) privately for only the brand to see and respond to (option 1), or (2) you can choose to \"create an NFT\" representing your content (option 2). If you choose to create an NFT, it will be available to Brands for more elaborate use. By offering your content as an NFT, you invite a brand to use your consumer-created content in their commercial business (e.g. to publish on their website as example to other customer, or to integrate it into their marketing content). If the brand values your customer feedback (either for internal use or for public commercial use), they can compensate you for it by acquiring the NFT.\n\nWe see 3 options to use the Consumer Moments tab, of which 2 include the creation of an NFT (see our illustrations \"Consumer Moments - including NFT button\", and \"Tradeable - consumer moments NFTS\"):\n\n(1) Send to brand – \"private\" mode\n\nIf you want to share your experience about a product/service with a brand private, just share a consumer moment and click \"send to brand\". The company will be able to privately respond to your concern, or to your happy feedback.\n\n(2) Send to brand – \"NFT\" mode\n\nUnder the NFT POC, we want to add a button \"NFT\", so that you can share your picture or video with a brand for commercial purposes. If you are ok that a brand uses your content for its marketing purposes, they can buy your consumer moment as an NFT.\n\n(3) Send to industry category – \"NFT\" mode\n\nUnder the NFT POC, you could also choose NOT to tag a specific brand, BUT instead one of our industry categories (e.g. travel & adventure; food; clothing etc). This way, your NFT (representing your video or picture) would be made available in the NFT platform not only to one brand, but to all brands who are active in this industry that you chose. You can make a creative video about how you like to drink Gin-Tonics at the beach, and send it to all the companies in the \"Food and Drinks\" category who can choose to use your creative video.\n\nWhat other challenges are ahead in our \"Zero-knowledge advertising & insights\" development roadmap?\n\nThis NFT project is only one step into our broader Cardano technology adoption, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. We have already WON one project (under FUND 5), and submitted other projects under FUND 6 (see below) for important features we want to develop as part of this effort:\n\n- step 1 - personal data license smart contracts - under this step, individuals can select to share certain information to with a brand of their choosing and get compensated for it. (see our proposal in fund 6 – \"dapp to control/monetize your data\" - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/366908-48088))\n\n- step 2 - privacy ledger – This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform, showing which data subject rights you exercised towards brands (e.g. the right to be forgotten, the right to rectify incorrect data etc). UPDATE - We have submitted this proposal under the \"metadata challenge\" of FUND 5 and received the first place! #thankyouADAcommunity. See here for our proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088. We will keep you posted on our progress.\n\n- Step 3 - digital ID (for FUND 6) - Atala implementation – If you want to control your data online and receive (financial) compensation for your data, it is important you can provide proof of your identity. Atala Prism is the perfect solution. By integrating Atala, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments. We have included this functionality under Fund 6 – Mass adoption of ATALA PRISM DID, named \"control your data (vault) via PRISM; https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-vault-via-PRISM/367840-48088?submitted=1\n\n4.    Practical aspects – \"show us the money\" – costs\n\nVia this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our NFT proof of concept (POC). Creating a first POC of a NFT platform on the Cardano blockchain, will require at least a budget of 49.250 USD for a 4-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 35 days of senior blockchain developer @ 900 USD per day – totaling 31.500 USD\n\n- 20 days of web/backend developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.000 USD\n\n- 10 days of app developer @ 300 USD per hour – totaling +/- 4.500 USD\n\n- 7 days of legal & operational work (draft license terms from NFT + verify privacy concerns with data in NFT) @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.650 USD\n\nBlockchain / Crypto aspect (60%) would be the biggest part of the development, creating the NFT token platform and integrating it with ADA wallets;\n\nWeb/backend development (25%) to insert the NFT platform into the existing brand dashboard, so the B2B Profila users can purchase NFTs and utilize the consumer feedback/content.\n\nApp development is more limited (15%) and would mainly relate to UX/UI, adding a new button the Consumer Moments functionality so users can select \"create an NFT\" when they make a video or picture.\n\n5.     Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer\n\nAt the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 6, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.\n\n(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila.\n\nWe have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021 (Q1 2022). According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 by the end of 2022 (by adding more brands).\n\n(2) Geographical focus market? We are launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q3 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).\n\n(3) Ideal consumer segment? – Millennials (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old) and brand-loyalists (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).\n\n(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.\n\n(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end of 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).\n\n6.      Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)\n\nAs an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:\n\nFirst, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.\n\nSecond, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.\n\nIn addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.\n\nFinally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess (and take feedback) on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.\n\n7.      Defining success\n\nThe NFT POC we would develop under this Catalyst fund 6 submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to improve the consumer-to-brand relationship by giving people control over their data and compensation for their attention.\n\nSuccess of the POC development would be (i) creation of the NFT button into our existing App; (ii) working NFT platform into the Brand dashboard. Overview of the work-packages which technical requirements and sprints to be included shortly.\n\nSuccess of the POC testing in the Profila Platform would be that we can (ii) validate that consumers choose to make NFTs for their content and feedback, and (ii) that brands utilize this content and pay consumers via an integrated or linked ADA wallet.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368122-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nWe will launch our solution in September.

Authentication of skills to an individual using DID based on Atala PRISM (#2 above) would allow third parties to provide certifications (#3 above) with confidence that they are certifying the right person (and that such credentials could not be improperly reused).\n\nWe would implement these deliverables primarily in Python with a PostgreSQL database and access via a REST API, like the rest of the LearnerShape open source infrastructure (see below). For integration with Atala PRISM and other Cardano infrastructure, we have agreed to partner with Gimbalabs (see Team section below). The specific requirements for such integration are not yet clear, because the Atala PRISM API and SDK have not yet been released.\n\nWe would define success in this project as:\n\n3 months\n\nfully-articulated development plan for all deliverables\nsubstantial progress on coding of deliverables\n\n6 months\n\ncompletion of deliverables and public launch, with code available as open source on LearnerShape Github repository (and within Cardano infrastructure as appropriate)\nplan for go-to-market through PeopleCert, Project Catalyst teams and other partners (see Go-To-Market Plan section below)\n\n12 months\n\nworking on further roadmap to roll out universal skills authentication in partnership with Project Catalyst / IOHK / IOG, PeopleCert and other partners.\n\nBecause the Atala PRISM API and SDK have not yet been publicly released, this proposal is for a proof-of-concept implementation that would be further developed as Atala PRISM advances. We would hope to better understand the technical details of Atala PRISM in the course of this project (ideally obtaining details of the API and SDK), though interactions with Project Catalyst and broader IOHK/IOG teams, to advance integration with Atala PRISM as far as possible at this stage.\n\nFuture development beyond this project could include (among others):\n\nfully functional web and mobile apps to access the skills authentication protocol\nallow certifying bodies to revoke a certification\nallow individuals to present only a subset of their personal skills graph\nintegrate LearnerShape machine learning functionality for skills comparison into the skills graph\nconsider incentivizing use of the skills authentication protocol with ADA and/or a bespoke token\nintegrate (and support interoperability) with other authentication technologies (e.g. new 'personal ID' feature to be added to iOS 15).\n\nSkills Authentication and Potential for Driving DID Mass-Scale Adoption\n\nThe accurate communication of skills is a difficult challenge. Whether the skills taught by a university course or the skills of a job applicant, verification is often incomplete, laborious and susceptible to significant errors or outright fraud.\n\nThere are various ways that skills can be learned and confirmed, e.g. (a) diplomas and certificates from universities and other educational institutions, (b) certificates from professional bodies, certification organizations and examination institutes, (c) references from colleagues, mentors or supervisors, and (d) evidence or demonstration from the individual with the skill.\n\nModernizing skill certification with Atala PRISM would create a universal system in which\n\nany individual can claim a skill or qualification\nanother entity, such as a university, can certify they have that skill\nthe certification can be verified by another entity, such as a prospective employer.\n\nThe universality of such a system relies on a common framework for skills. There is extensive prior development of skill frameworks, including options for the entire economy (e.g. O*NET and ESCO) and specialized options for specific industries and fields. However, the lack of any generally-accepted skills framework and the periodic announcement of new frameworks produces significant confusion. LearnerShape has addressed this challenge by using AI to enable organizations to work with any skills framework (see https://www.learnershape.com/blog/going-beyond-skills-taxonomies-with-AI). LearnerShape's approach allows a skills certification in one framework to be compared with a skills certification in any other framework, allowing the overall system to be universally applied.\n\nThe potential for Atala PRISM and DID generally to address the legitimacy of skills and credentials is already being explored, including through the Ethiopia project (which is a major inspiration for this proposal) as well as other proposals in response to this challenge (we are cooperating with some of these – see Team section below). Expanding authentication using Atala PRISM to the huge market for individual and workforce skills would provide a powerful driver to mass-scale adoption of Atala PRISM. By 2025, the global education market is expected to reach ~$7.3T including ~$404B for educational technology (https://www.holoniq.com/notes/global-education-technology-market-to-reach-404b-by-2025/), and digital skills management will be a key enabler of this ongoing growth.\n\nLearnerShape and Open Source Learning Infrastructure\n\nLearnerShape (https://www.learnershape.com/) is building the world's first AI-driven, open source learning infrastructure – a set of microservices for delivering any education application. Our open source components are in the lsgraph repository (https://github.com/LearnerShape/lsgraph), and an explanation of our services is in our e-book (https://mailchi.mp/learnershape/ebook-april-2021-flexible-ai-based-open-source-learning-infrastructure).\n\nA key challenge in recommending a future career or the best learning resources is understanding the current skills of the individual. An area of focus for LearnerShape has been how to work with the different concepts, terms and skills frameworks, taxonomies and graphs currently in use. Adding skills certification and authentication is a key piece of this process, and we hope to work with Cardano Catalyst and Atala PRISM to do so. Our previous work on flexible skills frameworks (see e.g. https://www.learnershape.com/blog)) will give us a major head start on the proposed project.\n\nWe provide a YouTube link below to a LearnTech Meetup event at which Maury Shenk speaks about LearnerShape's approach to skills at 33:40 to 41:04.\n\nTeam\n\nOur key team members are:\n\nMaury Shenk (proposer, https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauryshenk/)) is CEO and co-founder of LearnerShape, director at PeopleCert (a global testing and certification company) and experienced technology lawyer. He has worked on digital authentication issues for more than 25 years. He would lead the proposed project.\n\nJonathan Street (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanstreet/) as Head of Data Science at LearnerShape has been applying advanced machine learning models to understand the relationships between skills. He would lead technical implementation of the proposed project.\n\nSean Miller (https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmiller1066/) is an experienced full-stack developer who plays a key role in delivering LearnerShape applications. He would assist with interface elements of the proposed project.\n\nLorenzo Zorzi (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-m-zorzi-chiarioni/) is an advisor to LearnerShape with strong entrepreneurial experience and a background in financial services. He would assist with designing the user proposition for the proposed project.\n\nWe have also agreed to cooperate with Gimbalabs for integration with Atala PRISM and the Cardano ecosystem more broadly, including Haskell programming and general experience with the Cardano environment. This cooperation has been agreed through discussions with Randall Harmon (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3084778-48088?) and other members of the Gimbalabs team.\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nWe propose a budget of USD 48,000. This is primarily for the following development costs:\n\ndesign of flexible skills framework, including data structures and file formats (deliverable #1) -- USD 10,000\nindividual authentication protocol based upon Atala PRISM (deliverable #2) -- USD 7500\nskills authentication protocol based upon Atala PRISM (deliverable #3) -- USD 7500\nweb application for accessing the above (deliverable #4) -- USD 18,000.\n\nIn addition, we have budgeted USD 5000 for user proposition design and project management. These amounts include our costs of cloud infrastructure (primarily compute and database on Amazon Web Services) and other overhead.\n\nThe proposed budget is below the cost for delivering the project on a commercial basis, but we are committed to co-investment of time and resources to work with Cardano on this project.\n\nLater stages of the project could be funded by Project Catalyst or other sources (e.g. PeopleCert, angel/VC investors or grants). LearnerShape is an early-stage company. Our initial development has been funded by Innovate UK (the UK's government innovation agency) and founder/friends equity. We are currently operating on a per-project bootstrap basis, and anticipate raising seed funding once we have sufficient commercial traction.\n\nGo-To-Market Plan\n\nOnce a universal skills authentication protocol is developed, we would actively promote its use.\n\nOur key partner for going to market is PeopleCert (https://peoplecert.org/), a global provider of certification services where Maury Shenk is on the board of directors. PeopleCert has been cooperating with LearnerShape since 2019, and has specifically agreed to support LearnerShape in its cooperation with Project Catalyst. PeopleCert has recently substantially strengthened its market position through acquisition of AXELOS, a joint venture between Capita and the UK Cabinet Office (see https://www.capita.com/news/agreement-to-sell-stake-axelos).\n\nThere is also a significant opportunity for cooperation between our project and other Project Catalyst projects. During the F6 proposal refinement process, we have already discussed cooperation opportunities with proposers of various related F6 projects including:\n\nBlockademia Verification System (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Blockademia-Verification-System/366827-48088) – dApp for certification of credentials; strong potential synergies with our project as a third-party certifier (see deliverable #3 above)\nOptimizing student agency with DIDs (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Optimizing-student-agency-with-DIDs/369878-48088) – certification of student achievements and progress; potential use case for our proposed service\nEducation verification with DID (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Education-verification-with-DID/368554-48088) – certification of university credentials, starting in Malaysia; potential use case for our proposed service.\n\nThe proposers of all of these projects have confirmed initial interest in cooperation. We would pursue these collaborations once our project has advanced towards public launch, and we expect that numerous other cooperation opportunities will arise in the very dynamic Project Catalyst environment.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368250-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nBuilt on Cardano, BoC, is currently live, running in BETA, and is already far ahead of its competitors in terms of scope, usability, and the quality of its content.\n\nApproximately 1100 hours of work have been put into BoC over the course of the past three months to get it to its current state and we want to expand our vision of this map of the Cardano ecosystem further. This includes:\n\n \n\n- Increasing the quantity and quality of listed projects week on week, including in-depth research and the writing up of informative and unbiased descriptions for each project.\n\n- Creating a dictionary of industry specific terminologies to be coded into the terms used throughout the site. This will be done using pop-up definitions, so that when a user hover over an industry specific term e.g. AMM, mainnet, smart contract, babel fees; the definition of that term pops up, meaning they don't have to leave the page or even lose their spot in the text.\n\n- Provide industry descriptions, written in layman's terms, across the platform to introduce the user to, and familiarize them with, the subcategories of the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n- Integrating \"available in\" language tags into all projects and searching capabilities to facilitate the ease of finding and using tools built on Cardano in the users native tongue.\n\n- Expanding project page designs so they are tailored to spotlight the unique features of each specific industry e.g. An NFT collection is very different from a DEX and both are very different from a developer tool. All project pages are currently uniform. We will assess each of the 13+ industries to document its specific needs and develop page formats and input forms to suit these needs.\n\n- Currently, BoC showcases Cardano in a project-orientated fashion through a search function. This method of discovery resonates strongly with the existing Cardano community but fails to capture the imagination and attention of beginner users who are dissuaded from further exploration by an excess of foreign concepts and new terminologies. We are going to develop a fun and explorative UI funnel, \"a journey through the industries\", aimed specifically at the Cardano and crypto newcomer. This UI will consist of education materials, specific to each industry category found on BoC, that break down and explain each unique industry to the newcomer. We will utilize various media formats and the project data we've accumulated to help us simply explain even the most complex of topics found in the Cardano-verse.\n\n- Optimizing the search and tagging functions to better organize the language of Cardano that is used to catalogue the ecosystem.\n\n- Performing a code audit to move BoC from BETA to public and to ready the platform for the almost exponential growth of both users and the Cardano ecosystem in the coming months and years.\n\n \n\n*BUDGET*\n\nAsking for $44,000\n\n$44,000 funds another 1100 hours of work -@ $40p/hr- for both development and content creation over the next 3 months.\n\n \n\n*DELIVERABLES TIMELINE*\n\n1 Month - The successful implementation of short and informative industry descriptions into the UI. Integrate language tags into all projects and the search function. The addition of 40+ projects and their write ups to the site.\n\n2 Months - Creation of the dictionary of terms along with implementation into all existing projects on the site. The addition of 40+ projects and their write ups to the site. Audit of existing code completed and BoC emerging from BETA.\n\n3 Months - Creation and implementation of the UI funnel \"a journey through the industries\". The addition of 40+ projects and their write ups to the site.\n\n \n\n*DEFINITIONS OF SUCCESS*\n\nThrough all of the below a steady increase in site visits, resulting in an increase in the adoption and awareness of Cardano, is a key and continuous metric of success.\n\n3 Months\n\nBecoming a developers go-to source for discovering the tools they will use to develop their ideas on top of the Cardano blockchain.\n\n6 Months\n\nUse of BoC as a referenceable resource by community hubs around the world. Discussions of translating the static educational content into various languages.\n\n12 Months\n\nContinue to maintain an up-to-date education system, library of projects, and level playing field for project discovery in the Cardano ecosystem. This means not having to succumb to financial pressure from advertisers or others attempting to manipulate our morals and steer the platform away from its pure purpose of education and discovery for their own individual gains.\n\n \n\n*WHY DO WE NEED BUILT ON CARDANO?*\n\nMany consumers (51% in some surveys) are currently investing in cryptocurrencies with get-rich-quick ideas and no knowledge of the cypherpunk and societal democratization ideals underlying their inception and proliferation. This gap between this reality and the dream state of indoctrinating more members of the public to become involved in the projects being built on blockchains exists for two reasons:\n\n1. The media-fueled, speculative-asset perspective of cryptocurrencies projected toward members of the general public.\n\n2. The time-consuming learning process required to become involved with any crypto project on more than a speculative investment level.\n\nIf one aspires to learn more and chooses to dive down the proverbial rabbit hole to explore the crypto-world below this superficial level they find a world full of highly fragmented, unorganized content and information. This content is often driven by ulterior motives -subscribers, stakes, and views- whilst content creators and investment returns regularly take center stage; with the information filling only a formal and auxiliary station.\n\nSuch content is not conducive to fostering further engagement with blockchain platforms, and it's fragmented nature doesn't give the newbie a cohesive path to a place where they can seek concrete knowledge of this foreign world and the concepts it puts forth; thus deterring them from exploring further, becoming an involved member of the space and, potentially, an advocate for the underlying ideals noted in the first paragraph.\n\nCurrently, when introducing others to the crypto-verse, those in-the-know will inform those who want-to-know by talking to them, by explaining \"it\" to them and telling them what it \"is\". They may show them a website or two -of either specific projects or a blockchain encompassing website like the Cardano Foundation- and then direct them to some select Youtube videos. But what do these closed-loop websites actually tell the reader? and, more importantly, where do they guide themselves thereafter?\n\nThe same goes for Youtube videos, except that the person behind the video may have an ulterior motive shaping their words; and, in a way, you can say projects' homepages do too. After this, then what? If our protagonist, armed with their iotas of new knowledge, is still willing to cast themself adrift into the oceans in front of them, where are they to steer their ship? There is no map to guide them. There is no tool to help them feel their way through the world of Cardano.\n\nIf only our in-the-know facilitator of this story could direct their, often tentatively eager, want-to-know amigo to an easily navigable map of the ecosystem? This map is our vision. This map doesn't only provide an overview of the whole, and often intimidatingly large, ecosystem that stretches out before the reader, it also contains smaller, sub-maps, to which an explorer can turn when they want to delve deeper into a certain element of the ecosystem; be that the canyon of DEXs or the sea of NFTs. Each of these maps comes with a legend, informing our new traveller of the meanings of all the strange acronyms and terminologies they find littering the maps of the ecosystem they're exploring.\n\nAs a community managed, ecosystem-growth-orientated platform Project Catalyst is yet to develop an information hub aimed at those looking to expose themselves to the possibilities of Cardano and educate themselves to a level where they can feel confident in participating; be that as a user of a dApp or blockchain based service, or by adding their voice to the community.\n\nFostering engagement, in any and all crypto-spheres, is most often done through encouraging the self-education of the under-informed by making them fumble blindly across uncharted territory; a world full of acronyms and technological terminology that can terminally bog the explorer down, stifling their desire to continue.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a poor way of improving the conversion rate of \"interested member of the public\" into \"informed user\".\n\nIn order to help drive the awareness and adoption rates of Cardano around the world there is a need for a uniform hub of up-to-date, informative content that is displayed in a neutral way and written in un-intimidating layman's terms without a bias. A \"central\" hub of written information like this can provide the citizens of the world with access to a uniform and easily navigable resource.\n\nWe have already started building it: builtoncardano.com","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368322-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nA free database that can be utilized to help the growth of five key sectors in each participating nation: social wellness, healthcare, identity, education, and legal documents. This free software and network will help drastically improve the flow of information, plus productivity of the individual, the government, and the private sector\n\nThe SHiELD Dapp Plan on bridging the gap by building a Dapp that the people, government and institutes can utilize to help grow the economy, health, and Social Wellness of the people and Country.

During this time, we will hire a part-time community manager (20 hrs./mo) to build and create a local community center in Victoria, BC, plan and run three educational seminars which will be open to the public, start on online community on Discord for SANADA, hold weekly online meetings to bring the community together, and engage in networking and discussion with the local community to spread the word and introduce them to Cardano and Catalyst.\n\nSetting up local community centers in the region (starting with Victoria) will give us the opportunity to connect with and recruit people to solve local problems using Cardano decentralized blockchain technologies. Opportunities exist here in the areas of focus on local governance (decentralization), Indigenous empowerment and sovereignty (decolonization), and sustainability/climate change initiatives (decarbonization). Cardano can help in those areas by creating solutions to those problems, and involving local people to address local issues will be key to creating social and economic impact in these areas.\n\nThe long term (multi-year) goals of SANADA will be to:\n\nTeach and communicate the benefits of the Cardano ecosystem to the local community and bring them into the Catalyst community,\nAct as a developer hub to educate and teach developers to create these blockchain solutions, and\nDiscover innovative solutions to help grow the entrepreneurial ecosystem and accelerate the creation of world changing solutions by local talent, particularly in the areas of decolonization, decentralization, and decarbonization.\n\nThirty-three million people share our home in this place we call Salmon Nation. It spans 9.7 million square miles of land and sea—about the size of North and Central America. From central California north to the Arctic, it includes 1.2 million square miles of land in Canada and the United States and generates between $1.2 and $1.9 trillion in economic activity each year. Salmon Nation (https://salmonnation.net/) is a multi-country bio region that extends from Alaska down to Northern California. Salmon Nation is a unique and beautiful bio-region that is home to millions of people, including Indigenous populations in both the US and Canada. From issues of Indigenous sovereignty, to re-envisioning democracy and governance, to the challenges of sustainable resource extraction, the issues and challenges of the region are many and require new ways of thinking and collaborating. Cardano brings the blockchain and smart contract solutions to help solve many of these issues with enough creativity and passion from the people on the ground trying to solve these problems.\n\nGoals and timeline for Fund 6:\n\nDecember 2021: Fund SANADA for 6 months as a trial period to launch the organization and spread the word about Cardano and build up interest and excitement about Catalyst in the local community.\n\nDecember 2021: Start SANADA as a non-profit organization incorporated in Victoria, British Columbia (heart of Salmon Nation) and set up a physical presence. We will operate out of a co-working space for lower costs, have access to event space, and to increase opportunities for serendipitous networking.\n\nDecember 2021: Set up our virtual online presence with a Discord server, weekly Zoom calls, and a website. We will also build an on on-line community with weekly virtual collaboration meetings.\n\nDecember 2021 - February 2022: Host introductory Cardano seminars for the local community. These will start with monthly educational meetups and networking events for 3 consecutive months to raise awareness of Cardano in the local community and get them involved with Catalyst (ideally these will be in-person events, but they may need to be on-line to accommodate COVID-19 safety recommendations):\n\nDecember 2021 seminar: What is Cardano and blockchain?

It allows disputing parties to find a suitable mediator to help resolve their conflict in a timely and cost-effective manner outside the court system. The marketplace enables mediators to focus on the mediation process without having to engage in often questionable business boosting practices; cases flow to mediators for a small percentage of their mediation fee.\n\n \n\nA Primer on Mediation\n\nMediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that allows disputing parties to come up with their resolution that ideally satisfies the interests of all parties.\n\nOn page 266, Carrie J Menkel-Meadow, Lela Porter-Love, Andrea Kupfer-Schneider, and Michael Moffitt write in Dispute resolution: Beyond the adversarial model (published by Aspen Publishers in 2005):\n\n\"It is a process in which an impartial third party acts as a catalyst to help others constructively address and perhaps resolve a dispute, plan a transaction, or define the contours of a relationship\"\n\nA mediator, usually a neutral third party with no prior connection to any of the parties, controls the process of the mediation, but not the outcome. Ultimately, mediation allows for parties to collaboratively solve their dispute.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to litigation, where parties are becoming increasingly entrenched throughout the process as adversaries.\n\nMediation within communities and the workplace have become common. Depending on the type of case and jurisdiction, parties may be required to seek mediation prior to being permitted into the court room. As mediation has an extremely high success rate in the upper ninety percent range, many cases never make it into litigation.\n\nAs the term mediator is not protected, anyone can claim to be a mediator. However, a skilled mediator has commonly gone through an extensive training program. Certified mediators on Win-Win have advanced degrees in Conflict Resolution or Law in addition to having graduated from effective mediation training programs.\n\nSome mediations may also require special subject matter expertise, as discussed on Ken Adam's livestream:\n\nMost importantly, mediators are great listeners. Parties will be heard --- something that the court system cannot guarantee.\n\n \n\nProblems of the current mediation system vs Solutions through Win-Win\n\n#1 Problem: Trusting Credentials\n\nParties cannot easily verify mediators' credentials, and the number of innacurate or even false credentials in the field is increasing constantly in the last years.\n\nSolution: Trust\n\nUniversities and peacebuilding organizations verify their graduates on Cardano. Parties have access to professional mediators and can check their certifications.\n\n \n\n#2 Problem: Mediation process slow to start\n\nConflicting parties do not have months to start the mediation process when they are ready to kill each other, and the current process to set up a mediation might take that long.\n\nSolution: Convenience\n\nParties find mediators specialized for their case instantaneously through our DApp. Clients flow to qualified mediators, according to their availability.\n\n \n\n#3 Problem: No refund/payment guarantees\n\nMediators may favor the party who pays their fees first. Mediators sometimes have to run after their money. Parties have no refund guarantees on a no-show by the mediator.\n\nSolution: Smart contracts\n\nRefunds and payments are handled by smart contracts. The mediator doesn't know who paid first, therefore lower risk of bias in the mediation process. The parties are refunded in case of a no-show by the mediator.\n\n \n\n#4 Ethical mediators don't have repeat clients\n\nAs the DevOps of Conflict Resolution, mediation helps parties to solve not only their acute, but also future disputes.\n\nGood for the world, but bad for business.\n\nMediators focus on the process\n\nWin-Win pre-selects suitable mediators for any given case. On Win-Win, mediators can focus on doing their work, and not trying to be the loudest on social media.\n\n \n\nTeam\n\nOur team site ( https://winwin-team.web.app/ ) has additional information on each team member incl.

Our vision is to use the technology to make an impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that is why we seek to work with non profits that are aligned with these objectives.\n\n \n\nWe plan on issuing NFTs or as we like to call them \"Proof of Donation\". We created the concept of PoD, taking the first step on the way to use NFTs beyond the monetary level and show transparency when donating, seeking to make this a standard. Where all the data of that transaction is recorded, like who donated, how much, when, to whom and for what, getting the full cycle of the payment, from user to use. We are going to give a PoD to everyone who has made a donation through us, giving trust again to the people who donate and eliminating one of the main problems we realized in our MVP.\n\nSo, what do we mean when we talk about once in a lifetime experiences?\n\nFor example, in our MVP campaign with the Red Cross we did an experience with Javier Calamaro, a musician from Argentina, who is also an environmentalist and protector of the seas. Together, we decided to invite the winners to an exclusive and private show on a cruise in the sea of Puerto Pirámides, while doing whale watching. This event raised the attention from different sponsors, who saw this not only as an opportunity to help the charitable cause we were helping, but also to use our viral content to promote their brands, generating awareness and encouraging sustainability causes.\n\nThat's why we like to say it's a \"Win-Win-Win\": where celebrities reach out to their followers in new, creative and emotional ways, fans have the possibility of living a once in a lifetime experience, while sponsors promote their products and, most importantly, everyone supports a charitable cause. \n\nWe use these fans, celebrities, sponsors and NGO´s engagement to create bigger, worldwide and mind-blowing experiences. Following Calamaro's example, imagine we create an experience with Pitbull and Royal Caribbean as the main sponsor, helping a charitable cause they believe in, where the winner's prize is an all-included, 2-days cruise with an exclusive Pitbull's concert in the middle of the sea...The potential donations, reach, and marketing has no limit.\n\n \n\nWhy Blockchain?\n\nWe use blockchain not only to develop a fully transparent and traceable framework, with faster international transfers and lower fees. But, in addition to the traditional method that with your donation you participate in a sweepstake, we offer new ways of interacting. Such as:\n\nCollectible PoDs to all those people who have made a donation through us.\n\nEvery celebrity and experience has their own limited collection of NFT's, introducing gamification to the model by giving a special prize to everyone who completes a collection. This motivates users to exchange the NFT's and complete the collections to win.\n\nAdditionally, inside every celebrity collection there will be sponsor's NFT's that will work as golden tickets to win sponsored prizes.\n\nFor example, we can make a campaign with Samsung and the winner of the \"golden ticket\" gets a complete update of his home office set up with Samsung's products.\n\nThe \"donate for free\" feature, where you can enter through a subscription model where everything donated through DEFI generates interest. At the end of the period you can donate the full amount or only the interest generated, recovering your initial donation. Here we target those people who usually subscribe to monthly or annual donation plans with nonprofit, but we can generate interests and add the opportunity to live a unique experience with their idol as an additional incentive.\n\n \n\nMVP\n\nWe did an MVP in Argentina in partnership with the Red Cross. Where we worked with 8 important celebrities from Argentina,  David Nalbandian (professional tennis player), Maru Botana (chef), Alejandro Lerner (musician), Bruno Zuculini, Pico Monaco, Attaque 77, Lirman and Zabaleta.\n\nOur business model generates viral content organically and that's how the MVP managed to raise more than 3 thousands of users in ~3 months without any marketing budget whatsoever. We also had great media coverage in important channels like newspapers and tv.\n\n \n\nCardano's ecosystem benefits:\n\nWe integrate different blockchain protocols and we truly serve as a bridge between fiat users and the blockchain ecosystem. We provide the \"baby steps\" most people need to start adopting and learning about crypto and blockchain through an easy and rewarding way.\n\nWe have different types of synergy in various levels with the Cardano Ecosystem:\n\n- We provide a purposeful use of NFTs as Proof of Donations (PoD), taking the first step towards transparency when donating.\n\n- We promote the use and trade of PoDs, boosting the use of Cardano's future NFT Marketplace.\n\n- We work with different companies that act as sponsors for each experience and part of our proposal is to introduce them to the world of NFT's, giving companies the opportunity to take their first steps on blockchain and crypto. Being an excellent opportunity for partnerships with Cardano.\n\n- We will work with different players from the Cardano Ecosystem such as, DEFI platforms, future payment processors, NFT marketplaces, etc.\n\n- We will have a constant flow of experiences, giving the opportunity to work with many celebrities and attract the general public into joining the blockchain scene and more specifically to the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\n- We have a unique equation where we connect celebrities, once in a lifetime experiences, sponsors and charitable causes. Cardano could benefit from the positive image that this equation creates, showing a purposeful use of blockchain and crypto.\n\n- We can impact the use of the Cardano Chain. Additionally we incentivize fiat users to use ADA for their donations.\n\n- We want to promote crypto literacy. Our platform promotes financial inclusion, where people learn to invest their money, debunking that the use of blockchain and crypto isn't for everyone, while helping a great cause.\n\n- Finally our mission is to make an impact on the SDGs, so the Cardano Foundation can be an excellent partner and funds receiver. We share our vision on achieving global sustainable development by using technology and helping different charitable causes along the way.\n\n \n\nTeam\n\nWe are two co-founders, Agustin Villalba Orúe and Joaquin Alvarez Vitale, two serial entrepreneurs from Buenos Aires. We are Digital entrepreneurs whose mission is to promote digital entrepreneurship adding value and facilitating technological disruption wherever there is a need.\n\nWe've known each other from elementary school, and became friends for almost for 20 years now. Being born in Argentina, we became two curious and creative minds who are constantly searching for out of the box solutions. We believe that with the correct use of technology and an excellent team we can create modern solutions that solve modern problems. That's how we started working as a team and have already co-founded other startups where we put together and manage both operations and developers teams.\n\nMatías Battolla, our CMO, who specialized in User acquisition and Growth marketing in companies such as Google and Mercado Libre.\n\nDemian, our CTO, who previously founded a software factory specialized in high-impact blockchain products.\n\n \n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nWe take an innovative approach to fundraising allowing NGOs to spend less time and money raising funds, where Wooy takes all the marketing and collecting efforts, allowing them to focus on what they do best, helping causes and creating a greater impact.\n\n \n\nWe leave you with a quote from Dan Pallotta that inspired us, and if you are interested you can find below his Ted Talk.\n\n\"If you kill innovation in fundraising, you can't raise more revenue. If you can't raise more revenue, you can't grow. And if you can't grow, you can't possibly solve large social problems.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nDefinition of success:\n\n3 Month: Contracts developed and first beta testing.\n\n6 Month: Platform completed and ready to launch first experience.\n\n12 Month: at least 10.000 PoDs created.\n\nBudget:\n\n80% contract development cost\n\n20% UI integration.\n\n \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Wooy?\n\nLove to hear some feedback and what type of experiences you would like!\n\nIf you want to learn more or collaborate you can write us to hello@wooy.co\n\nYou can also see some videos from our MVP campaign in:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WrWSNW3C7f-1pGg0oUfUldsA0-9Y7MFU?usp=sharing","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368280-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\n1000 of small business fight for contract each and every day , only to have bank over charge on rates to fund cost associated with startup cost even though awarded contract are strong collateral , with the use of smart contract back by government contract funding could be done using ADA as a decentralized funding tool that would help small business grow and at the same time bring a ROI for Cardano.  The Platform would operate in three parts 1. small business date base system 2. blockchain funding system, 3. government contract close out system with each part solving a day to day problem in the small business contracting world.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368238-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nMirqur has unified and improved upon a number of interesting features which until now were only available mutually exclusive. We have focused on ensuring our mathematical solutions and system architecture is optimal. In doing so, we aim to deliver a solution that simplifies and increases profitability of liquidity provision and trading.\n\nIt is important that our users can understand and leverage these features in ways that are most applicable to their current investment strategy(s). It's important to mention some of the key features that we are building in order to understand the value of our project proposal. As such, below is a list of our features and a more comprehensive overview of our DEX can be found in our light paper here - https://mirqur.io/mirqur.io_lightpaper.pdf\n\nDEX Features\n\nPortfolio-pools - Portfolio pools allow liquidity providers (LPs) to easily add a number of tokens to a pool and adjust their ideal ratios arbitrarily. This simplifies portfolio management.\n\nRange-pools - Range-pools give individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated. This increases the profitability of liquidity provision.\n\nImpermanent loss insurance - If you qualify and withdraw while in impermanent loss, you will be reimbursed for the difference. This secures your crypto assets. Note - this is a feature that needs to be brought on following the release of the platform due to the nature of the insurance mechanism.\n\nRoadmap\n\nQ3 2021 - Fundraising, testnet, smart-contract implementation\n\nQ4 2021 - Mainnet launch, audit, data collection for trade optimiser, portfolio-range pools\n\nQ1 2022 - Impermanent loss and AI trade optimisers\n\nTeam\n\nOur team has worked for big tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft as well as startups in Sweden and Seattle. This combination of experiences gives us both the rigour but also the \"getting-things-done\" mentality. Our team has a combined Haskell experience of over 10 years of Haskell which is perhaps one of the key factors to success in Cardano atm. You can find more information on our team on our website - https://mirqur.io/#team\n\nDefinition of Activities\n\nActivities for this project proposal are centered around the user experience of the DEX both from the perspective of the LP and the traders.\n\nGiven that we have expanded the feature set available to LPs, the interface for liquidity provision needs to be logical and follow a familiar flow to what LPs may be used to. It should cater to all investors who have varying degrees of experience with these concepts.\n\nBeing able to get a sense of the market and different portfolios is key for decision making. By improving the way we display key market indicators such as trading volume, total locked value and price fluctuation, we will ensure that our users make responsible and profitable investment decisions. In the future, this feature will be expanded when we release some of our LP provision optimisation tools whereby the use of different liquidity provision strategies will be reflected in the dashboard.\n\nThis project proposal is focused on two main activities:\n\nImproving the interface for providing liquidity to portfolio-range pools to ensure that liquidity providers can take full advantage of our feature set through a familiar and logical UI.\n\nImplement a dashboard for monitoring different portfolio pools and highlighting popular pools. This will enable users of our platform to make better decisions about how they provide liquidity and trade using our platform.\n\nDefinition of Success\n\nThis project can be broken down into two deliverables which will all be delivered within 3 months:\n\n(1) An improved interface for providing liquidity provision which also includes:\n\n     - A minimum of 10 user-testing sessions\n\n     - DEX UX/UI report\n\n(2) A Portfolio tracking and monitoring dashboard\n\nBudget\n\nThe total budget for the two listed deliverables and costs including VAT:\n\n \n\n40 research hours - UI/UX user testing and reporting\n\n100 engineering hours - An improved interface for providing liquidity provision.\n\n60 engineering hours - Portfolio tracking and monitoring\n\n \n\nFixed cost for this work which is composed of developer's salary, accounting/taxes and VAT: $36,200\n\nRelevant links\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Mirqurio\n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/ZqJnQPnHwa\n\nTelegram - https://t.me/mirqurio\n\nWebsite - https://mirqur.io/\n\nLightpaper - https://mirqur.io/mirqur.io_lightpaper.pdf\n\nFAQ - https://docs.mirqur.io/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368396-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nVision\n\nTo be the world's go-to trusted destination for all types of wagering in an all-in-one easy-to-use app. The token holders will act as the house and share in the profits. Along with other types of functions and perks for holding our token and being part of the ecosystem.\n\nHow It Works\n\nALLIN Token - The token that you hold and can use to make bets, by holding this token it represents your share of the profits based on your tokens relative to the outstanding supply. This token comes with the volatility of the crypto markets.\n\nALLIN Stable Token - This token is pegged to fiat currency such as US Dollar or Euro so that you separate your bankroll from the volatility of the crypto markets but do not receive a portion of profits for holding this token.\n\nBet Types\n\nBet vs. Chain - You can place a bet similar to a sportsbook but instead of betting the house you are betting against the blockchain. Everyone that owns tokens in the ecosystem acts as the house.\n\nWhen someone wins a bet, the system will mint that amount of tokens to payout the bet and the reverse if someone loses a bet, the system will burn that amount of tokens that was bet.\n\nEvery bet and Mint/Burn transaction is recorded on the blockchain to make sure there's no foul play.\n\nBy holding the token there will be fluctuation in terms of minting and burning of the tokens due to the bets but also of the supply and demand of the price of the token.\n\nThis is how we're able to turn the ecosystem of token holders into \"the House\" and have a sustainable ecosystem that brings change to an industry that is ready for it.\n\nPerson-to-Person - You can place a bet controlling the subject, odds and terms through blockchain smart contracts and have another person accept that bet with no middleman.\n\nPools - You can start a pool with friends/co-workers or join a pool with people from around the world in a variety of pool types across all sports and other subjects that use smart contracts to validate results. Some examples are survivor pools, bracket pools, Pick'em tournaments, celebrity pools, etc.\n\nEsports/Video Games - You can bet on professional esports teams or you can play someone in your favorite video game, card game or other games.\n\nSports Index Tokens - It's the stock market for the sports world. Replace companies with players or teams. Trade team/player performance tokens that create an algorithmic score or rating based on many different factors (stats, salary, media/popularity, etc.) that is unique to a specific sport. These performance ratings generate dividends for token holders. It's a free and open market to trade these tokens where the price will be based on supply and demand.\n\nCasino Games - You can play online casino and card games with trust and transparency that the outcomes are fair through the use of blockchain technology.\n\nFantasy Sports - You can start a league with friends/co-workers or join a league with people from around the world in a variety of fantasy types across a variety of sports. Some examples are daily fantasy, season-long leagues, keeper leagues, playoff leagues, etc.\n\nDevelopment Overview\n\nWe are using agile development practices and development is underway.\n\nOur goals for this funding round are:\n\nBackend - Completion of the backend models and APIs for the Person-to-Person (P2P) and Bet vs Chain (BvC) bet offering and accepting, fund management, and social media and news data integration.\n\nFrontend - Development of the frontend web application with P2P and BvC bet offering and accepting, fund management and social media and news data integration.\n\nDesign - Initial UI / UX designs for MVP functionality.\n\nPrediction Outcome Verification (POV) - Integration of POV technology.\n\nPerson-to-Person - Plutus smart contract.\n\nBet vs Chain - Plutus smart contract.\n\nWe will deliver web and mobile applications for Windows / Linux / Mac / Android / iOS with the same functionality, using React and React Native.

The Ensuro team developed a decentralized platform to collect and deploy insurance capital to meet that growing need for capacity.\n\nEnsuro matches capital and insurance risk in a unique way. In providing capital, Ensuro aggregates incoming funds - in the form of stablecoins - from a constellation of institutional and retail liquidity providers (LPs). In assuming risk, Ensuro partners with MGAs and uses its reserves to support their products. By charging a commission, Ensuro secures revenues for its liquidity providers and itself. Consequently, Ensuro sits between liquidity providers (seeking higher investment returns) and MGAs (looking to access capital at affordable conditions) and is innovative for both.\n\nAs an investment solution, Ensuro is part of the growing Decentralized Finance movement. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols aim to provide traditional financial instruments without relying on centralized intermediaries, but rather using blockchain technology and smart contracts. DeFi is experiencing remarkable growth: having only appeared in 2019, its protocols currently handle more than US$ 80b and are adopted by more than 2.5 million users worldwide. Institutions are showing a growing interest in DeFi, allured by its success, efficiency, global reach, and decentralized structure. DeFi users can currently - among other possibilities - get loans, trade currencies, and speculate on price movements of a broad set of assets. While these options are very mature, the decentralization of the insurance sector is still in its infancy. Ensuro aims to be the first protocol to guarantee DeFi users the possibility of accessing insurance risk, providing them with an additional source of returns and a way to diversify their investment portfolios. \nThe Opportunity\n\nThe new wave of MGA's disrupting the traditional insurance space requires not only insurance capacity but also a partner who understands the need for new technology to drive out the embedded inefficiencies which exist in current market practices. Ensuro addresses both of these requirements (1) by tapping into the huge volume of innovative capital, which is growing exponentially and flowing into Decentralized Finance (DeFi), to provide insurance capacity and (2) by using smart contracts on blockchain technology to introduce a new level of operational efficiency.\n\nCompetitors. Ensuro's competition can be divided into two main segments, traditional and non-traditional competitors.\n\nWithin the traditional ecosystem, the main competitors are insurers, reinsurers, and the Insurance-Linked Securities market.\n\nInsurance and reinsurance are the natural competitors of Ensuro, providing underwriting capital to support both their own products and external MGAs. Having owned the majority of the insurance value chain with little/no competition, the legacy system had defined policies and processes standardization, solvency regulations, and economy of scale. However, the current set-up benefits established players to the disadvantage of policyholders, brokers, and those at the periphery of the insurance value chain. At the bottom of the insurance chain, insureds face inflated premiums to bear the costs of overheads, cost of capitals that ranges from 2% to 15%, and frictional compliance. Opacities and delays in claim assessments and payouts bring costs that take up about ~40 % of insurance revenues on average. Ensuro's model challenges incumbents by imposing itself as a cheaper alternative for MGAs and providing an appealing investment for liquidity providers. Through its smart contracts, Ensuro manages policies in a completely automated fashion, reducing overheads from 25% to 1% - 3%, whilst offering a reduced cost of capital as a result of supplementary returns coming from investments in the DeFi space.\n\n \n\nInsurance-Linked Securities (ILS) are financial instruments whose values are driven by insurance loss events. As securities, some ILS can be and are traded among investors only on the secondary market. Insurance-Linked Securities allow insurance and reinsurance carriers to transfer risk to the capital markets and raise capital or capacity. Policies covered by ILS (usually cat bonds) must be fully collateralized, increasing their cost of capital. Annualized returns of Global Hedge Funds with investment strategies in Insurance-Linked Securities averages around 2% (reference Heurekahedge database). Through its smart contracts, Ensuro gives access to insurance risk at a level unmatched by the current ILS market, which remains out of reach for retail investors.\nFor the ILS investors, Ensuro offers a more dynamic and liquid solution for participating in insurance risk. Indeed, ILS suffers a trapped-capital problem: when an ILS contract is seen to be at risk of facing losses, the cedent can call for the collateral to be trapped or frozen, so it remains available while loss development continues. The collateral is trapped and unavailable for reinvesting, which can create a drag on ILS investment portfolios. The capital can remain trapped for months or years until the ultimate loss associated with the contract is clear and a payout is deemed due or otherwise. Ensuro mitigates this issue in two different ways. First, the functioning of the protocol is such that an investor can always liquidate its share of the collateral as long as another investor is willing to take her position; second, Ensuro will initially focus on parametric products with short tail liability, and its policies are handled automatically by smart contracts. For each policy, if the conditions for a payout are met, the smart contract reimburses the policyholder; otherwise, the policy's collateral is released immediately at the policy's expiration.\nFinally, due to differences in solvency capital requirements, we expect Ensuro's pools to be a more profitable investment than ILS.\n\n \n\n Non-traditional competitors are insurance projects of the Decentralised Finance ecosystem. The main players are Nexus Mutual, Cover Protocol, and Etherisc.\n\nNexus Mutual is a crypto mutual fund focused on policies against smart contract failure and exchange hacks. Similarly, Cover Protocol is a peer-to-peer coverage market that allows DeFi users to be protected against smart contract risk. Both projects are non-licensed; hence they are currently covering a non-regulated segment of the insurance market. Nexus Mutual's current Total Value Locked (TVL) is 504.74M with 0.13% of supply locked in the protocol (up to date). Cover Protocol's current Total Value Locked (TVL) is 840K, dropping from 50M in December 2020 and 25M in February 2021, with 0.01% of supply locked in the protocol (up to date). Thanks to its license, Ensuro expects to operate as a regulated reinsurer and, differently from Nexus Mutual and Cover Protocol, will have access to a larger segment of the insurance market.\n\n \n\nEtherisc is a decentralized insurance protocol to collectively build insurance products, which dates back to 2016 and pioneered research in blockchain based insurance. Etherisc is currently offering technical guarantees for payout instead of legal guarantees, fully relying on the immutability and transparency of smart contracts technology. Etherisc's legal structure defines Etherisc's contracts as simple service contracts instead of insurance contracts, effectively transforming the concept of premium into service fee and the concept of insurance into protection, with the consent of German regulator BaFin. Etherisc is currently operating in the Flight Delay insurance space, which represents the only licensed insurance product it offers, moreover, Etherisc is exploring Hurricane protection, Crypto Wallet insurance, Crypto-Backed Loans protection, Crop insurance and Social insurance, being at the stage of designing and prototyping such products. Etherisc's current market cap ranges around 30M, dropping from 70M in March 2021. Thanks to its license, Ensuro expects to operate as a regulated underwriter and, differently from Etherisc, will have access to a larger segment of the insurance market.\n\n \n\nThe Team\n\nMarco Mirabella - Chief Executive OfficerMarco was the Chief Strategy Officer of BigGo, the biggest price comparison website and vertical search engine in South East Asia.

The presence of well-defined cashback periods permits the protocol to plan ahead and compute the amount of capital available at any point in the future. With this forward-focused vision, Ensuro can always operate at the desired solvency level. Insurance is a profitable business. Being the heart and the fuel of the protocol, liquidity providers will share the profits from the pool, depending on the scale of their deposit and the duration of their cashback period.\n\n \n\nRisk modules: Ensuro's partners will have access to the protocol's liquidity through our Risk Modules. Each risk module will be connected to a specific insurance product. To protect the Liquidity Providers, the Ensuro Risk Monitoring Module will perform proper back-testing of potential risk modules and Quality Assurance Tests (QA) on the outstanding ones to check that their performance is in line with expectations, and correct for possible deviations.\n\n \n\nAsset manager: Ensuro's asset manager component will rule the interaction of Ensuro's reserves with other DeFi protocols. Specifically, the asset manager will deploy a part of or the total fund in other risk-free protocols (e.g., Aave) to provide additional returns to the liquidity providers. \n\n \n\nBenefits of Ensuro\n\nEnsuro's model will bring several benefits to the entire insurance business chain. Through its smart contracts, Ensuro manages policies in a completely automated fashion. This feature helps to reduce overheads, benefiting the policyholders. Moreover, the automatic, transparent, and trust-less verification of a policy's trigger reduces the possibilities of fraud and eliminates any effort in the claiming process, ultimately benefiting both the policyholders and the partner MGAs. For MGAs, working with Ensuro has an additional benefit. Thanks to the openness and immutability of data stored in the blockchain, the performance of insurance products is recorded and available for audit, providing MGAs with solid proof of their models' validity and visibility to investors.\n\nEnsuro will open the insurance risk market to retail and institutional investors. So far, access to this type of risk - suited to the creation of diversified investment portfolios - is denied to retail investors and still cumbersome for larger players. Due to differences in solvency capital requirements, we expect Ensuro's pools to be a more profitable investment than ILS, one of the few alternatives currently available to access insurance risk.\n\nFinally, Ensuro will be able to provide capital to MGAs at convenient terms. Indeed, Ensuro's liquidity providers will experience supplementary returns on their investments thanks to the protocol's interaction with other players in the DeFi space such as Aave (https://aave.com) or Compound (https://compound.finance). These extra sources of revenues can help Ensuro to propose capital at a cost on the cheaper side of the spectrum while satisfying the LPs return expectations.\n\n \n\nCurrent Status\n\nEnsuro's smart contracts are completed and can be viewed here: https://github.com/ensuro \nThe smart contracts will be audited the first week of September\nWhitepaper available here: https://ensuro.co/Ensuro_WP.pdf\nWon the first prize in the Binance Hackathon: The Future is now: https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/projects/binance/ensuro/\nJoined Celo Camp Batch3 and  won the Celo Innovating on Money Award : https://medium.com/celoorg/announcing-the-grand-prize-winners-of-celo-camp-batch-3-58dd0eef19fc\nStarted the process to obtain a license as Insurance General Business (IGB) under the innovation sandbox in Bermuda\n\nGo To Market\n\nAs a first step Ensuro plans to complete the process to obtain an insurance license in Bermuda.

It involves deliberate deception for profit, including food mislabeling, adulteration, country of origin misrepresentation, weight misrepresentation, nutritional misrepresentation, and repackage. It is a border-less crime that has infiltrated supply chains for profit. No food or place is safe from food fraud, and he rules for controlling food fraud are not perfect.\n\nExisting regulatory measures cannot prevent all criminal activity in this area, and we don't have a system to verify the sourcing and quality of ingredients and in a way that can be done by everyone instantly. In developing countries like India these illegal practices have a much broader impact. For food and beverage manufacturers, growers, manufacturers, processors and retailers, this can have serious consequences in terms of revenue, customer loyalty and reputation.\n\nConsumers are not always able to tell which claims are based on rigorous research and what are just marketing tricks. Food recalls due to E. coli bacteria, salmonella and other pathogens or allergens occur due to lack of visibility of the supply chain and the volume of ingredients coming from n anywhere in the world. This endangers public health and threatens the reputation of the global food industry.\n\n \n\nProject Description:\n\nRaw material traceability software provides the highest level of physical traceability and transparency available in the supply chain. We use tools like GPS mapping, GIS technology, mobile phones, off-chain oracles, and serialization systems to map the supply chain. Collecting and analyzing large amounts of data using machine learning techniques can automatically deter bad actors.\n\nThe app is meant to be an end-to-end design with role-based access control features. In other words, everyone in the supply chain - customers, distributors and vendors - shall make use of it. Customers are free to use the app, with a nominal fee when ordering food from cloud kitchens and restaurants that are equipped with Kitchain. There is also the option for customers choosing to directly purchase raw ingredients. Our existing local food partners and farmers in Tamilnadu shall be onboard as our cloud kitchen pilot initiative, with more onboarding to come as the customer and vendor base increases.\n\nWe make every stakeholder visible in the supply chain, providing access to valuable data and alerts to quickly determine if the food is safe and healthy and also optimize the production methods by analyzing the place of wastage. It digitizes secure transactions or \"blocks\" at every point in the supply chain, directly visible to those who have access to this blockchain ledger, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\nTraceability allows you to implement corrective actions quickly and efficiently when problems occur. When a food company or government agency identifies a potential food safety problem, an effective traceability system can help isolate and prevent contaminated products from reaching their destination - consumer hands.\n\nWhile supply chain vulnerabilities are evident in cross-border transport, this project could close the intrusion loop for potential criminals along the supply chain and thus reduce food fraud. Blockchain provides the ability to track in real time, so it is time consuming and does not require potentially malicious document processing.\n\nCreating cloud kitchens in countries like India would reduce the cost of food and make it more affordable when you don't have the expense of hosting customers in the restaurant. The same mobile and web apps used for supply chain tracking can be used as a cloud kitchen platform too. In essence:\n\nA mobile app and a web app anyone can use to trace the origins of the food they are eating.\n\nThe new features we plan on introducing in the mobile app is to use Augmented Reality to display the supply chain of the food. For instance, kitchens and farms are largely invisible to customers currently, and our idea is to induce trust by visualizing the supply chain. Other features to be introduced are to be learnt and implemented along the way with feedback and requirements.\n\n \n\nTeam members:\n\nBharath - https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharathrb/\n\nSam  - https://samjeffrey.web.app/\n\nSam Jeff is part of the developer team at Gimbalabs, which is a Catalyst-funded start-up to enhance Cardano adoption by small businesses.

The API that the PAB provides allows PAB clients to interact with contract application instances. Contract endpoints which are exposed by running instances can be called via the client API.\n\nFor front-end developers, there is currently no well-documented development library that allows users to interact with contract instances in the Plutus Application Backend. Indigo Labs plans to build a Plutus Application Backend TypeScript SDK for interacting with contracts, through both an HTTP API as well as the websocket API. This SDK will also be extended to include API endpoints for the ChainIndex package alongside the PAB.\n\nWe believe that this SDK will help create a positive developer experience and allow developers to focus on building successful apps.\n\n# Who is Indigo Labs?\n\nIndigo Labs is a team of developers building key DeFi applications for the Cardano Ecosystem. The first product we plan to build is Indigo Protocol. This SDK we are building is key to bringing our products to life, as well as useful for the greater Cardano developer community.\n\nOur team consists of several Plutus developers, a senior front-end developer, and two tech consultants. With these resources we believe we can produce an excellent API that can be used by hundreds, if not thousands, of dApps. Our team is also a top community contributor to the Plutus GitHub repository, has also contributed to Yoroi, and is active in the dApp development community.\n\n# Metrics / KPI\n\nSize-related metrics:\n\n1. Lines of written source code\n\n2. Code integrity (qa, devops, testing related metrics)\n\n3. Documentation clarity\n\n# Project Roadmap\n\nWe run weekly sprints, reports will be provided in our weekly development updates.\n\nSprint 1 - Develop TypeScript interfaces for all Plutus API responses.\n\nSprint 2 - Develop HTTP API for interacting with PAB contracts and endpoints.\n\nSprint 3 - Develop WebSocket API for interacting with PAB.\n\nSprint 4 - Develop an HTTP API for interacting with the ChainIndex package.\n\nSprint 5 - Build a testing framework for the API.\n\nAll of the code developed will be open sourced under the Apache 2.0 License.\n\n# Budget Breakdown\n\n7 weeks of Plutus SDK development, 1 FT senior web developer, 1 PT Plutus Developer:\n\n1 FT Senior web developer (tax/transaction cost included): $25,200\n\n1 PT Plutus developers (tax/transaction cost included): $9800\n\nThese developers are paid $90/hour. We offer a competitive pay to be able to snag the best talent in the industry.\n\nGitHub Link to SDK Repo: https://github.com/IndigoProtocol/plutus-pab-sdk","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368540-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nThe Cardano BI metadata search engine has been called the \"Google of Cardano Metadata\" and is a vital tool for easy access to Cardano metadata. The tool has been around since January 2021 and is one of our site's most popular functions. The beauty of this search engine is that metadata is readily available as long as you know what the metadata contains. No need to know the address or Cardano internal transaction id's to find a metadata message. Simply search for the text content you remember is part of the message and you can view it. \nSince the search engine was released, a lot has changed. At that time, metadata was new and only used by the community developers for experiments and tests. Today, transaction metadata is used for all kinds of use cases and projects on Cardano and usage is only increasing! The number of potential search hits is increasing with several thousands each day.\nTo make our search engine even better and ready for a future where simple searches for \"Cardano\" will return millions of search hits, we ask Catalyst for funding of the following enhancements\n\nLet users display search hit list directly if they want. Default today is to display number of search hits\nAdd more filtering options, for example metadata by type, by key, by month...\nPaging functionality to navigate search hits in manageable portions when thousands of hits are returned\nPopular / most searched for phrases\nPopular / most viewed metadata messages\nHighlighting of searched for phrases in result list\nSearch speed / response time improvements\n\nWe expect the search enhancements to be ready within 2 months after proposal funding is secured by the Cardano community voters.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368588-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nMarket: \n\nThere are more than 20,000 universities in the world. We would like to MVP in Malaysia and replicate success worldwide.\nThe solution is scalable to upskilling or online learning platforms, which are becoming increasingly popular and more than 100 providers available globally.\n\nOpportunities:\n\nThree major touchpoints are involved in the process of education verification in the context of background checks\n\nAn Educational Institution that produces digital certificates and\nan Employer/Company (HR) that requests consent for validation,\nas well as a mobile phone (students and fresh graduates) that tracks and provides consent.\n\nand this enables us:\n\nTo provide a digital verification process to Education Institutions, Companies, and Students/Fresh Graduates using DID and Cardano blockchain.\nTo build a web-based app or product as an API that can be integrated with an existing system that Education Institutions and Companies (HR) currently use.\nTo build a mobile/web app that allows end users (students, graduates etc.) to manage their DIDs/credentials\n\nWhat makes this unique: \n\nEnabling universities or colleges to produce digital degree or diploma that is immutable and easily shareable for verification. Employers could easily perform education verification without the need of third party, hence making it cost saving.\n\nWhat we have learned so far:\n\nThe process of performing background checks is time-consuming and costly especially when employers are considering candidates but have not yet hired them.\nA local solution called eScroll has already been implemented. As we learned, this solution only provides 'hash certificates' to students, which the future employer has to enter on the college/university website in order to verify. DID is not used as a solution.\nData privacy has always been a concern for people. The current hiring process is a hassle where the information(usually in hard copies) has to be shared even before the job interview takes place, and they are unable to track what has been shared digitally.\nThe banking sector requires job candidates to get solicitor's stamps to verify their documents (including education certificates). The candidates need to physically walk into a solicitor's office to receive the services. Other than that, this is a paper-based process.\n\nThe challenges:\n\nApplications based on blockchain technology can be complex for some end users, and many simply don't understand why certain features like Seed Phrases matter.\nImplementing blockchain technology in our product requires us to adhere to country, industry, or business policies and practices.\nLocally, we must adhere to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). PDPA is an act enacted by the Malaysia Government and was established on 15 November 2013 to protect individual personal data and sensitive personal data in a commercial transaction.\n\nWhy we need the fund: \n\nTo quickly get the product out for market validation and iterate to fit the needs\n\nWhat success looks like:\n\nThe goal is to build a product that focuses on getting early adopters, so at the early stage we are working iteratively to ensure the product fits business and user needs.\n\nIn 3 months: MVP of web and mobile app is out. At least onboard 3 users of local universities/colleges, 5 users of companies/corporates, and 100 users of students/fresh graduates.\nIn 6 months: At least onboard 6 users of local universities/colleges, 10 users of companies/corporates, and 300 users of students/fresh graduates. The product is stable and performs well on major touchpoints.\n\nBudget Breakdown in USD:\n\nDevelopment=60,480\nResearch & Development=3,000\nTools=5,000\nMarketing=2,000\n\nTotal ~70,480\n\n \n\nThanks!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368554-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPrior to the launch of a given Fund we will offer information sessions to anyone interested in submitting ideas to Catalyst.

According to information from ECLAC, in Latin America and Colombia, 10 years of efforts to reduce poverty and misery have been lost; After the economic and social crisis that unleashed the pandemic, as well as the historic 6.8% drop in GDP last year.\n\nGlobally, emissions reached a record 33,143 million tons of CO2 in 2018, in Colombia they reached 74,954 kilotonnes two years ago. The government's goal is to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% by 2030.\n\nIn energy and industrial systems, the options considered feasible for adaptation to global warming of 1.5 ° C are water management and cooling strategies, but these are not sufficient strategies.\n\nALMAGUA has been established as an organization oriented towards sustainable development within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (ODS), through projects that help mitigate gas emissions and empower communities economically in favor of social, sustainable and at the same time to guarantee\n\nan economy worthy of those who live in marginality and poverty, especially women and children.\n\nThe project is characterized by merging three important factors for interoperability, scalability and performance in exchange protocols, such as the physical, digital and financial worlds. As supports for the structuring of a platform that will contribute to sustainable human coexistence, strategic alliances, cooperation and financial competition, the constitution of investment ecosystems, the change of the energy matrix and the fulfillment of the SDGs.\n\n \n\nProcess\n\nOnce Cardano has available the development of smart contracts, Almagua will initiate a process together with developers and interest groups willing to support the initiative for the creation of smart contracts for the creation of a DAO in the Cardano mainnet, with voting power and a democratic system for the approval and creation of new tokens, with a platform similar to the Catalyst Idea Scale.\n\nAlmagua develops social projects of aquaponic, hydraulic and productive reforestation, so that it can provide benefits to society and that its impact is measurable.\n\nThe projects will be certified by an entity; These certificates will be uploaded to the cardano mainnet through a unique registration code such as Non-Fungible Token in the Cardano network, which can later be consulted from the DAO Almagua. In this way, other companies or corporations interested in the acquisition of carbon credits will be able to monitor the process and will be aware that through the compensation process for the acquisition of credits they will also be supporting social and environmental projects developed by the Almagua foundation in different sectors of Colombia, Latin America or the world.\n\nEach of the projects that Almagua can be replicated in other communities, since each of these projects is based on productive reforestation, donations and recycling campaigns to carry out the correct management of resources to have a holistic and totally circular approach. .\n\n \n\nInitial stage for Found 6\n\nAs a first stage, to make our project possible, it will be of great relevance to create a Pool in Cardano Mainet, to get collaborators, for each person who joins the Pool, Almagua agrees to plant a tree with the capacity to absorb CO2.\n\nThus, Almagua and the community will work together in favor of the native communities and the environment, on the one hand, the Pool community will have incentives in the adas and collaterally they will be supporting reforestation projects, part of the adas collected by the Cardano Pool. It will be destined to the support and maintenance of the network, in the course of this time we will be training ourselves for the development of smart contracts, at this stage Almagua commits to making the first prototype of Certified Token, and in this way we can take those initial steps to a DAO in favor of mitigation with carbon neutral credits so that in the very near future Almagua can create new Tokens with Carbon Neutral Certificate.\n\n167 kg of CO2 is the absorption capacity of a tree per year, that is why we propose this initiative of productive reforestation and by productive we mean that they are trees that will also fulfill the function of generating resources for native communities, this is a point exit to new projects that encourage the mitigation of the carbon footprint,\n\nBy planting a tree we mitigate the impact of the energy equivalent to that necessary to keep a computer on for 1 hour and 30 minutes = 1 hour 200 Kwh TOTAL: 80.00 Kg CO2eq.\n\npc in 1 hour 200 Kwh TOTAL: 80.00 Kg CO2eq\n\nAnd since we are talking about proof of participation, Almagua is committed to doing the entire block creation and validation system with the implementation of solar energy and equipment that does not require a lot of energy consumption or computing power. we are sure that with the implementation of a simple solar panel system, a smart meter, a rasberry pi and a server in amazon Aws we can make this initiative possible.\n\nTo make possible the sustainability of the pool, allmagua will focus its efforts on carrying out educational campaigns of cardano in favor of environmental initiatives, in social networks, educational institutions, universities and interest groups in favor of the mitigation of the carbon footprint, of In this way, people will be able to have much more knowledge of the power of cardano and will understand all the correct process from the creation of the personal wallet, the acquisition of the adas, the pools, the proof of stake philosophy and transfer processes to their personal wallet. to do the freezing or staking process.\n\n \n\nMembers\n\nVanesa Giraldo\n\nSergio Gonzalez\n\nLuis Fernando Montoya\n\nEstimated project time at 12 months\n\nThe first stage will be development and the tests will be carried out during the first semester until June.\n\nThe second stage will be focused on the marketing and communication plan of the platform, with a duration of 3 campaign months from July to September.\n\nThe third stage will publish the platform to finance social projects through donations between October, November and December.\n\nFrom the initial planting stage until December, people will be able to monitor the growth of the trees with the implementation of an IP cam,\n\nwhich can be accessed from the main page of Almagua, parallel to the creation of blocks Almagua will enter the certification process\n\nwith neutral carbon, a process that will be done through reforestation.\n\n \n\nBUDGET\n\n- $ Amazon AWS 1,500 USD x year\n\n- Security audit and maintenance 500 USD\n\n- $ 1 Hardware Smart Meter - $ 2,000\n\n- $ Web for the pool 1,500 USD\n\n- $ Netlify Business 99.00 USD\n\n- $ Facebook Ads 1,535 USD\n\n- $ Google Adwords 853 USD\n\n- Certificate of $ CO2 11.98 USD x 1 Certificate - pilot test for the creation of the certificates.\n\n- $ 100 amp hour lead-acid battery\n\nwith the capacity of 12 volts DC - 120 USD\n\n- $ cables to convert direct current to 120 volt alternating current - 50 USD\n\n- $ panels emitting a maximum of 200 watts - 1900 USD\n\nTotal = 10,000 USD\n\nTotal = ADA 3467.4\n\n \n\nMANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES AFTER 12 MONTHS\n\nManagement of platform resources, in its final stage and of operation with the resources generated from the pool.\n\nThe funds raised from the pool will be used to maintain and support the platform, as well as the creation of new reforestation certificates.\n\n25% of the resources will be used to cover administrative and operational costs.

The film was respectful of them as pioneers.\n\nSimilarly, Cardano's successful Project Catalyst Proposers are pioneers of decentralised, blockchain ventures pushing to create the new system, whose stories are yet to be told.\n\nTo see opportunity and act upon it requires an entrepreneurial mindset, tenacity and confidence all of which are advanced by seeing, hearing and understanding others who have gone before. Finding role models whose stories teach others by example to \"sweat the problem\", \"keep it simple\", \"deliver value\" and execute on many more tropes, challenging themselves to do so and never give up gives confidence to others to do the same.\n\nCurrent problems and limitations\n\nTo find the final versions of previous successful proposals is one thing, however finding the background – the telegram and discord messages, youtube videos of workshops, meetups etc – of what happened to create it is time-consuming and almost impossible task. Just how did the successful proposers develop their skills to execute & communicate their great ideas so voters/stakeholders valued the project?\n\nWhile some may be aware of how collaboration helped, how input received is incorporated, how long a successful proposer spends \"seating the problem\" many don't.\n\nThe lack of available fleshed-out examples of the human cost and benefit of being a Project Catalyst pioneer makes people suspicious and fearful that their effort will not be worth it or they won't measure up to the task.

We are co-founders and entrepreneurs and part of a team many thousand strong.\n\nOur Solution: Create a Library of Proposer Case-studies\n\nA library of up-close, in-depth and detailed investigations of proposers and their related contextual position. Showing how their product or service proposal was created and has been implemented successfully allows new proposers to see what their proposal preparation process can look like.\n\nWe've had a lot of success with case studies here at Venture Centre. We have run live, in-person events to explore an entrepreneur's story with pre-arranged and in-the-room Q&A's, video's compiled over the course of a programme or event and edited into an entertaining timeline of the ups and downs, and created blog posts written by or for entrepreneurs at various stages of their journey.\n\nThe Cardano Library of Proposer Case Studies will;\n\n#1: Tell stories\n\nBringing the process to life by illustrating who these people are and how they first designed a project or venture and then the process they went through to articulate it well. Stories paint a picture to activate people's brains and to understand what happened and how.\n\n#2: Demonstrate successes\n\nNot only will case studies focus on proposers, they will also demonstrate how Ideascales features, the Project Catalyst community channels have been used successfully. Prospective proposers care more about seeing how others have actually used the ecosystem to succeed than they care about hearing about what you can potentially do.\n\nIn this way, case studies demonstrate success. They prove that you're able to accomplish what you say you can do, based on real results and real stories, not just theories. Case studies give Project Catalyst and its community more credibility. They show that people are using the platform and channels and having success doing so.\n\n#3: Leverage our community of proposers' brands\n\nLet us leverage the brand power of our successful proposers and give them a boost too. By showing the entrepreneurs pioneering Cardano, we get to show that they are willing to recommend the community, the process and the platform and talk about what they are doing together with all of us. People care a lot about what other people have to say.\n\n#4: And, we all get to learn lots\n\nThese case studies will teach us a lot about Cardano projects. The patterns that emerge around delivering valuable products and services to customers on Cardano can become part of the tools and frameworks created for local community hubs. We'll learn things about Cardano products that we may never have known before by getting a good idea about how our successful proposers are doing what they doing and how their customers are reacting.\n\nThe initial library will include a range of:\n\nBlog posts : These are the easiest to publish and can be posted on multiple channels by multiple community members. We will write up the case study as a post, and then hit publish.\n\nPDFs : A formulaic easy-to-read format that includes callouts and special informational sections like 'fact packs' (like recipes the case-study subjects used for completing a task). Links to PDFs could also be e-mailed to prospective proposers when they begin working on the first stage, submitting proposals on Project Catalyst.\n\nInfographics : These will take more time to plan and design to present information in a visually appealing way that's likely to be shared via social networks.\n\nVideos : These can take a number of forms. Straightforward interviews with proposers will deliver a rich experience of the person and their journey. Mini-doco's including artefacts or animations can describe timeline and iteration steps. Panel discussion videos provide an insight into the differences which make a difference so we can notice and respect the limits of our expectations of ourselves and others.\n\nHaving created a library of Proposer Case Studies we will hope to work with the Catalyst School and Catalyst Swam to host, position and promote the library.\n\nWhat comes next: From there we hope to iterate and refine the case-study formats, translate these first case studies into more languages and provide guides and templates for others to follow and create case studies to add to the library.\n\nA note about challenge choice:\n\nWe have chosen the DLT Toolkit Challenge for this proposal as this content can serve multiple purposes. However, these case studies will be material to the design of the Cardano Canvas, Card deck and calculator we have proposed in the Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs challenge. With seven years of hands-on experience building community hubs at Venture Centre, we have a deep understanding of what it takes to support emerging entrepreneurs, build their confidence and enable them to articulate the value they aim to create clearly. We want to ensure this content is available to the networks of hubs we already work with, the thousands of others around the world and the ones which are still to emerge from small groups of people who watch or read one of these case studies, take action and make a stake in and for the future with Cardano.\n\nBudget\n\nAsking for $36,250\n\nThis funds @520 hours of work @$70p/hr for both research and development, and content creation over the next 6 months (21hrs a week)\n\nMajor Tasks\n\nProposer research\nInitial and Case-study interviews\nContent planning\nVideography, production and editing\nGraphic design\nContent writing, editing\nAnimation\n\nDeliverables timeline\n\nMonth 1 - Research and connect to conduct initial interviews.

They need to know first, its possible by people like them, how to do that alongside and in collaboration with the Project Catalyst community and many of them are new to entrepreneurship itself and the process of executing and articulating their idea.\n\nHow does success look like?\n\nThe average person will be able to become a proposer anywhere across the world and be relieved to find easily accessible content to help them start and progress. They will recognise themselves in the stories of others, identify skills and strengths they have by seeing the strengths and skills of others; learn how they to can make the human connections in the Project Catalyst community, and build a team o create ventures on Cardano. Their suspicions and fears that they may not be up to the task will be dispersed and more proposers from more people will appear.\n\nUltimately the result will be a steady increase in Cardano-curious at the top of the funnel and converting them to Cardano-community members and Project Catalyst proposers lower down, resulting in an increase in the adoption and awareness of Cardano, a key, continuous overarching metric of success.\n\nKey Metrics to measure\n\nNumber of users, using the tools and difference in score of applicants using the toolbox and those not using the tools.\n\n– To be achieved by setting up tracking on content and working with Catalyst school and Swarm to capture data from their use of the library.\n\nGaps that are filled in the entrepreneurial skills base of project teams from the start of ideation through project delivery.\n\n– To be achieved by creating new case-studies of those who have had access to the library and documenting how the content has helped with elements of the proposal process.\n\nSustainability of venture plans beyond the scope of Catalyst development project.\n\n– To be achieved through collaboration with Catalyst school and Swarm","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368720-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe testnet wallet at the provider URL has only been tested in Chrome so far.\n\n \n\nOur twitter: https://twitter.com/MedusaAdaWallet\n\nIf you need some testnet ada or tokens, just follow the link: https://developers.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/\n\n \n\nMedusa AdaWallet - is a free of charge community-driven project of a light wallet combining the best features of other existing offerings.\n\n \n\nMedusa was the first ITN-compatible public wallet and was released before ITN Daedalus and ITN Yoroi.

They:\n\nStore keys and sensitive data in public storage like localstorage or indexed db;\nDo keys-processing in the main browser thread;\nEven do not encrypt private keys;\nDon't care about 3rd party code injections in their code dependencies; \nDon't care about user's browser-extensions which inject their code to the page too;\nAsking users to type their mnemonic for each session;\n\nThis is an unacceptable approach for finance software. \n\nMedusa 2.0 does not have these issues, even at MVP stage. A lot of hard work went into achieving this, including researching, engineering, writing our own libraries and mechanics. It's not just yet another cardano-serialization-lib skin.\n\n \n\nWhat makes Medusa different?\nSecurity features that are already implemented:\n\nMedusa doesn't store and operate keys within the main browser thread - unmanaged 3rd party code is not able to reach them;\nMedusa does not send or store any unhashed / unencrypted data;\nMedusa does not perform unnecessary loading of encrypted keys;\nMedusa uses it's own network-security layer to transfer your data, so even if your https is compromised, or you use some 3rd party proxy server, or you are connected to untrusted network, your data can't be read by anyone else;\nPasswordless \"2FA\" based login system designed in strict accordance with RFC 4226 requirements;\nThere are no unmanaged code-dependencies;\n100% anonymous — we do not collect any user-related data.

This enables us to abstract over particular blockchain networks, while remaining faithful to the interfaces offered by actual networks.\n\nSince Reach abstracts the low-level details of the blockchain network, it enables DApp authors to develop on one platform (or purely in simulation) and deploy on another network. This is especially valuable for platforms in development that would otherwise need to onboard developers and coax them into rewriting their software to use the new system.\n\nThere are many existing DApps that are not built on Cardano and would require significant effort and energy to port. The Reach platform offers a concrete migration path via its abstract model of backend networks; this will increase day-1 adoption of Cardano.\n\nEase of Component Coordination\n\nThe Reach compiler uses type-checking, A Normal-Form transformation, information-flow security, and end-point projection to derive each component correctly from the single specification.\n\nEase of Correctness\n\nThe compiler is integrated with a satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) theorem prover (e.g. Z3) to automatically check the correctness of the application via developer-specific predicates, as well as automatically generated properties. Reach enables formal guarantees to be embedded in the source code and automatically verified. Auditors of Reach programs can objectively assert the correctness of DApps by adding more guarantees to the source code and demonstrating that these new properties are met (or not). Anything that increases the trustworthiness of DApps will be a boon for the blockchain community, which is reeling from the lack of confidence inspired by high-profile attacks.\n\nIn summary, Reach builds on decades of research in formal verification, compilation, and optimization of cryptographic protocols. The robustness of these aforementioned techniques will be demonstrated in the building out of the POCPoC blockchain-enforced information trade application on your platform.\n\n \n\nFurther information is in the attached document.\n\n**YouTube Channel:** https://www.youtube.com/reachsh","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368725-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nDescription:\n\nBy adding a DID to a user account on NFT marketplaces we can further increase the verifiability of the originality of artworks.

A new way of working together. A new way of solving vexing problems. The future has arrived, the challenge is to evenly distribute it; To paraphrase William Gibson13.\n\nTo see opportunity and act upon it requires an entrepreneurial mindset. Entrepreneurs are everywhere. Tech Entrepreneurs, Impact Entrepreneurs, Interpenuers. They are driven by their beliefs, principles and values. They see the world from a local perspective, as it could be.\n\nTo develop the entrepreneurial mindset and turn ideas into sustainable projects and ventures, community-led hubs become places entrepreneurs can build knowledge, share information, connect, learn about and support each other. They can evenly distribute the Cardano future.\n\nCurrent problems and limitations\n\nTo stay relevant and sustain their operations Local Hubs need to develop engaging programmes of events, workshops, and networking opportunities. However, as a newly emerging field that blends entrepreneurship, blockchains, token engineering, culture, governance and Cardano it is hard to find expertise to instigate, shape, host and run these events. When language and cultural barriers are factored in, reaching entrepreneurs becomes even more difficult.\n\nFew entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities, the technical and economic benefits or the Project Catalyst community governance of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology to micro, small and medium businesses, or startups who have the vision to scale. We need local hubs to distribute that knowledge, to make Cardano a viable option for solving market needs.

These artefacts kick-start a customisable open-source set of business model co-design tools that help entrepreneurs understand and explore how to apply Cardano's technology. They create a shared community language for the greater good.\n\nUsing these resources as facilitation tools will help people understand each other and the opportunities the Cardano platform can provide them in their particular problem/solution space. They aid the process of blending worldview, information, and expertise. They focus effort on experience-based learning by providing a fun way for people to analyse, communicate, and decide.\n\nWe have extensively used the Lean Startup Canvas1 as a facilitation artefact in hundreds of Start Weekends2 held across New Zealand. The Cardano Business Design Toolkit is inspired by and modelled after the Platform Design Toolkit3. A synthesis of the Business Model Generation4, Customer Development5, Design Thinking6, and Wardley Mapping7 applied to blockchain business models. The Platform Design Toolkit is inspired by analytical tools like Lean Startup Canvas.\n\nThe initial toolkit will include three components:\n\nCardano Business Design Canvas: A set of co-design templates and associated guides that help facilitate team discussion and analysis of token business models.\nBlockchain Economy Card Deck: A set of design patterns and methods presented as cards that prompt discussion and investigation 8.\nStartup Cost Calculator: A web-based tool to help entrepreneurs budget for the costs of setting up and running a new venture 9.\n\nOur first test deployment of the Cardano Business Design Toolkit will be in Vietnam and Indonesia!

They will recognise common patterns, language and symbols and so making human connections in new communities, getting started on the earliest stages of ideation amongst a diverse group of new people and team building to create ventures on Cardano will be simpler.\n\nSince this will be a first-of-its-kind market design resource, we plan to measure whether or not it is successful in properly instructing entrepreneurs. Instructing them in the technical and economic benefits of Cardano.\n\nWe're using our experience with similar tools in the Venture Centre with thousands of entrepreneurs over seven years. That includes many StartUp Weekends that used the LeanCanvas.\n\nOur access to a large community of social entrepreneurs means we are able to rapidly prototype and design the ideas with our local network. We also plan to use and gain experience with the tools, in upcoming events with the Eastern Townhall and also seek to help the Catalyst School to use and provide feedback.\n\nThe most important benefit an entrepreneur walks away with is an understanding of:\n\nPlatform business and incentive models for use and distribution. (Non-Blockchain)\nHow platform business models are enabled by token designs. (Blockchain)\nHow Cardano's Native Assets, Meta-Data, and Smart-Contracts are be used to implement token fuelled platform business models.

We know evolving knowledge is crucial for helping us navigate change. In particular, we would like to explore the impact of receiving recognition (NFT) and in the future perhaps a reward (token) for contributing to the evolution of common knowledge. \n\nWe have created an online space (guides.co) for people to explore and collaborate on common (contextual) knowledge. People are already sharing this knowledge in live documents (a guide). Currently each guide has 1 owner and a number of admins with edit rights, plus many users contributing comments and reflections to that guide. However the problem we see is that over time the evolution of the content significantly drops in these guides (even where we are sure the content could be still relevant).\n\nWe've identified that a problem is that having only 1 author is counter productive for creating a perception of shared ownership (\"why should I help if it mostly benefits him/her?'). Of course the underlying assumption is that if you share ownership over something you invest more time in it and take better care of it. A first step would be to experiment with displaying multiple owners in a guide (see mock up attached), including designing and testing a process for becoming a co-owner. With thousands of guides and counting doing this at scale requires a decentralised and trusted process. This is where we think NFTs can play a big role.\n\nA guide as NFT - shared ownership: Become a partial owner of the guide you have contributed to.\n\nEvery document (guide) is a unique NFT with every meaningful contributor being awarded a fraction of the ownership. As more people contribute the guide becomes richer and more 'valuable' and thus your part becomes more valuable. Contributing to different guides allows you to own parts of many NFTs. A user would build up a 'wallet'/portfolio of NFTs.\n\nThis project would explore 2 phases, where 1 lays the ground work for 2.\n\nPhase 1\n\n1a. How shared ownership should be experience most effectively, design and UI\n\n1b. Design a collaboration process resulting in shared ownership that can be translated into an algorithm which can be repeated at scale\n\nUX/UI Designer & Developer: $20.000\n\nPhase 2\n\n2a. A prototype to mint an NFT for each guide\n\n2b Combining the collaboration process with awarding fractal ownership of an NFT\n\nDesign & development: $20.000\n\nProject Management: $10.000\n\nTotal: $50.000\n\n-------\n\nSuccess after:\n\n3 Months: Shared ownership design & experience, and a prototype of the contribution process that results in co-ownership\n\n6 Months: Test the collaboration process at scale, and build a working prototype to mint a guide as an NFT and award ownership based on the contribution process.\n\n12 months: Phase 2 of the project?\n\nIf there is time & budget left we would also like to explore the next phases in the project, such a as how NFT ownership could also lead to financial rewards. Next steps following this prototype could be connecting a KYC, testing the prototype at scale, integrate with a wallet, and making it available to all users. \n\n-------\n\nWhy we need a different kind of space to share knowledge? There are places online where people share knowledge, but these assume a question always has the same answer (wikipedia/wikihow), it's cloudy where knowledge comes from or repetitive (forums), limited in scope and application (not contextual), and/or don't reward the contributor (wikihow). \n\nWhat we think is missing is a place to navigate change together. We think if we can crack the link contributions-recognition - reward while leaving intrinsic motivation intact, open-collaboration could get a serious boost. Doing this project openly here and with the community allows us to share our experience with others so they can build on it and get a head start. \n\n-------\n\nWhy we think this will help the Cardano ecosystem? This project would explore how blockchain technology could help a relatively complex real world issue at scale (collaboration & shared ownership). It would also lay the first stepping stones for how this could link to more advanced applications of smart contracts such as DAOs. Either way we think it is definitely something very different from art or property NFTs.\n\nKeen to hear your thoughts!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368701-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nIt's hammer time!\nCurrently there are over 70 million Youtube videos on DIY projects, but no proper way to incentivize the Makers who explain how something is made. \nYoublob is an online makerspace for collaboration and blueprint sharing around all these ideas and creating an eco-system around idea sharing back to the industry in order to create new opportunities on new levels of interaction and data sharing.\n\nTake ownership of your idea in the open source space, allow others to create iterations from it, show the industry who you are and what awesome things you can build with their products! \n\nWe are allowing open collaboration across all subjects, all while maintaining the high level of documentation around iterations and how something is made, along with creating incentive models on top of this to put the idea maker in the front seat of the whole solution.

W3C DID Working Group and DIF foundation are making great efforts in that direction and hence many solutions with real use cases were developed with those concepts in mind.\n\nFor Atala PRISM and Cardano to success in mass-adoption as a DID solution, it's necessary that it can be integrated with existing frameworks that are currently used in real DID solutions. Two examples of that are Hyperledger Aries framework as used by Sovrin Foundation, and DIF Sidetree as used for ION in Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWe believe that if Cardano plugins are available for most common frameworks, providers and developers of DID solutions will start considering Cardano ledger as a valid and excellent option. In other words, being \"ready to use\" plus the advantages of Cardano over other blockchain will boost adoption in the near and long term.\n\n \n\nPROJECT DETAILS\n\nIn concrete, our proposal consists in facilitating the foundational building blocks as a reference to the broad DID community so they can adapt their solutions to work with Cardano with minimum effort.\n\nWe divided this work in two parts:\n\nPart 1: Standardization and documentation\nPart 2: Cardano plugins development\n\n \n\nPART 1: STANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION:\n\nThe purpose of this initial phase is to normalize and document how Decentralized Identity can be used in Cardano so anyone interested could clearly understand how can be implemented. It should be also designed to be read by people from outside of Cardano community that need to interpret how they can adapt their solutions to Cardano Blockchain. Document style will be similar as the one used in Cardano Developer Portal with a hope that can be included there.\n\nIf Atala PRISM implementation code is opensourced in time, we will leverage that information and develop a guide explaining how DID are stored and retrieved from Cardano blockchain.\n\nIf Atala PRISM code is not opensourced in time, we will develop a guide explaining several options on how to store and retrieve DID from Cardano blockchain.\n\nThe scope of the document will include, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\nDID syntax conventions (i.e. did:ada:mainnet:{identifier})\nHow DIDs should be stored, retrieved, updated, and deactivated\nWhere DID Documents should be stored\nDID Document conformance (i.e. W3C Decentralized Identifiers v1.0, DIDComm messaging)\nLinks to useful tools, guides and examples\n\nDeliverable: github or webpage with hosted document\n\nEstimated duration: 2 weeks\n\n \n\nPART 2: CARDANO PLUGINS DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe goal of this phase is to get involved with existing solutions in the DID ecosystems and contribute to integrate them into Cardano blockchain. Those activities are the main driver to get worldwide mass adoption as they will facilitate the broad community outside Cardano to include our ledger in their solutions.\n\nWe called those integrations as plugins, not necessarily in the strict sense, but to be seen as essential piece of software or module that can be easily included in existing frameworks. By that means, the framework will adopt Cardano as the ledger part of the solution.\n\nObviously, the scope of building plugins in general is as broad as we can imagine, so hence, for the purpose of this proposal we will just focus in three cases, leaving other cases to next funding rounds and the community.\n\nSpecifically, we will develop plugins for:\n\nDIF Universal Resolver (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver)\nHyperledger Aries from Linux Foundation (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries)\nDIF Sidetree reference implementation (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree)\n\n \n\nThe first one is the development of a driver following DIF Universal Resolver specifications that will allow to resolve DID stored in Cardano blockchain.\n\nDeliverable: github with open-source code\n\nEstimated duration: 2 weeks\n\n \n\nThe second one corresponds to the development of code needed to adapt Hyperledger Aries framework to interact with Cardano ledger. We will focus on Aries Cloudagent Python (aca-py) and Aries Framework Javascript. We will provide functional sample code that the community would clone, build and execute.\n\nDeliverable: github with open-source code\n\nEstimated duration: 1 month\n\n \n\nFor the last one, we'll develop a Cardano Plugin and instaniated version of Sidetree reference implementation that communicate with Cardano desentralized ledger, in a similar way that ION did it for Bitcoin. The code will also include a README.md that explain how to compile and execute in a real environment.\n\nDeliverable: github with open-source code\n\nEstimated duration: 1 month\n\n \n\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\nSTANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION: USD 3.500\nUNIVERSAL RESOLVER DRIVER:                      USD 3.500\nHYPERLEDGER ARIES PLUGIN:                        USD 15.000\nDIF SIDETREE PLUGIN:                                     USD 15.000\n\nTOTAL: USD 37.000\n\n \n\nPROJECT SCHEDULE\n\nSTANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION: 2 weeks\nUNIVERSAL RESOLVER DRIVER: 2 weeks\nHYPERLEDGER ARIES PLUGIN: 1 month\nDIF SIDETREE PLUGIN: 1 month\n\nTOTAL DURATION: 3 MONTHS\n\nPROJECT ORGANIZATION\n\nThe project implementation will follow Agile management based on Jira Cloud tools. Jira users can be created for follow up and auditability. Additionally, a bi-weekly report will be publish with project progress, mayor milestones and risk assessment.\n\nThere are four deliverables that constitute the main metric of progress and success:\n\nPart 1 Documentation\nPart 2a Universal Resolver driver\nPart 2b Hyperledger Aries plugin\nPart 2c DIF Sidetree plugin\n\nAs a commitment to the transparency of the allocated funds, we expect payments based on above deliverables without the need of advance payments.\n\n \n\nTHE TEAM\n\nThis proposal was elaborated by Rodolfo Miranda. His Linkedin profile can be find at https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfomiranda/\n\nHis background includes a MS EE degree at Stanford University and more than 25 years of successful work experience in both large multinational companies and owned startup projects. His main activities involve architecting, developing, and implementing large scale software solutions for the Telecommunication Industry. He leads multi-disciplinary and multinational teams in the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nMore than 40 years of self-taught programming with advance knowledge on many coding languages. Lately, he was engaged in blockchain technologies with emphasis in Cardano blockchain.\n\nFor this personal project he will allocate sufficient time resources to cope with the project. An additional developer will be included to the project to help developing in the existing DID frameworks. The final selection of the developer will be made among already known developers from Latin America that were part of other projects. Note that the developer does not require a full understanding of Cardano blockchain, but a great knowledge of Javascript and Python languages and ability to understand specifications and protocols.\n\n \n\nADITIONAL IMPORTANT NOTE\n\nWe understand that when ATALA PRISM is delivered it might include additional code or SDK that overlap with some of the deliverables planned in this proposal. In that case we won't copy and use that code as part of our deliverables. Instead, that part of that project can be disregarded. We've broken down the budget and timeframes so each individual part of the project can be eliminated from payments and total duration.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368705-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nDescription:\n\nBy translating NFT-MAKER to German we want to make the most used NFT-Minting platform more accessible.

As the result indexes allow investment into the entire crypto market and its sectors, such as DeFi projects, DEXes, NFTs, etc.\n\nThe advantages of investing into index, compared to manual portfolio management are\n\n- wider market exposure, helping to avoid 100X market gems, and ensuring more stable returns,\n\n- balance against single asset failures - if one DEX fails to perform then other in the portfolio will absorb its share, hence in that sense the risk is neutral as the index represents the entire sector (in this example DEXes).\n\n \n\nExamples of indexes from the world of traditional finance and crypto:\n\n- S&P 500 tracking composed 500 largest companies stocks weighted by market capitalisation representative of the entire US economy;\n\n- FTSE 100 - 100 largest companies listed on the UK exchanges weighted according to their market cap;\n\n- (Ethereum) DeFi Pulse Index: https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi , tracking the performance 25 largest Ethereum DeFi projects according to the composition formula (each project capped at 25% max allocation), balanced monthly.\n\n \n\nProblem\n\nAlonzo HFC event leads to the rapid development of Cardano DApp ecosystem. \n\nThis means that\n\n- among so many projects it'll be very easy to miss a lot of hidden 100X gems;\n\n- focus on seizing all investment opportunities;\n\n- risk management and understanding;\n\n- access to higher barrier to entry projects (NFTs, private sales, etc.);\n\n- for many people it will be hard to achieve market benchmark returns, but index is exactly the definition of the benchmark returns.\n\n \n\nIndex performs 2 important roles from the investor point of view:\n\n- gives wide exposure to the market;\n\n- is a passive investment, user invest funds into the index, and doesn't have to perform any other actions, index itself is managed to the composition formula;\n\n- it's sectors benchmark - essential on-chain data allowing for the evaluation of all other investment possibilities using Share ratio (comparing excess return to the excess risk measured using volatility).\n\n \n\nSolution\n\nWe propose implementation of on-chain financial indexes of 3 broad types:\n\n- financial (fungible token) indexes - investing in fungible tokens representing different projects share / internal currencies;\n\n- NFT indexes - index composed of NFTs bought and sold based on the current price, valuation, and market sentiments, starting with art, but with t he growth of NFTs in the future potentially also representing all the deeds stored on the blockchain;\n\n- Cardano delegation index - an aggregated way to delegate ADA via smart contract to a portfolio of pools according to a specified condition, e.g. single stake pool operators, ecosystem developers, mission-driven pools, etc. Each pool considered for the index would need to mean the block production and reward requirements.\n\n \n\nThe index protocol would consume on-chain price Oracle, reserve, and other data, according to the index specification, and each cycle (T = 6 epochs = 30 days) would rebalance the index according to the new parameters\n\n \n\nFounder\n\nJarek -

Depending on where a person starts, they may need to learn Haskell, the eUTXO model, and Plutus. Furthermore, the person may need to learn how to set up a development environment that can support their efforts, perform proper testing, and implement general programming best practices (e.g. security).\n\nThere's another, more general challenge that we aim to solve with this project. That is the difficulty of knowledge and skill transfer. The ultimate goal of a training program is to prepare someone to be self-sufficient in completing real-world goals and challenges.\n\nIn the context of smart contract development, this should mean that after the program, the person can take a programming task, such as building a DEX smart contract, gather requirements, synthesize what they mean, then design, build, and deploy a solution.\n\nHowever, it is hard to achieve this outcome with simple how-to articles or videos. At the end of reading or watching such content, the developer may still be unable to solve their own development goals.\n\n \n\nProposed Solution\n\nOur solution to the problem is to create a Cardano Developer's Academy. This academy will provide a robust, immersive learning experience for Cardano developers. This learning experience was designed with the following principles in mind:\n\nReal-World Projects: Our training content shows how to build real smart contracts. The material will start with basic smart contracts, and proceed to teach advanced concepts\nStep-by-Step Explanations: The training content will be built in a modular, step-by-step approach with very good explanations for each step\nHands-On Practice: The training content is integrated directly into a development environment\nCode Challenges: In addition to providing step-by-step walkthroughs, we will reinforce the concepts learned by providing challenges for the person to complete\n\n \n\nHow The Solution Works\n\nThe learning environment has three major components. First, there is a Learning Management System (LMS) functionality. Second, there is a customized Web IDE that provides access to a Plutus dev environment and the ability to code in a browser. Lastly, there is Cardano course content embedded into the Web IDE.\n\n \n\nLMS Functionality\n\nAuthor courses (modules, lessons, labs, code challenges)\nStudent registration\nStudent coursework interface\n\n \n\nWeb IDE\n\nVisually explore smart contract designs\nStart a dedicated Plutus development environment\nComplete coding challenges\n\n \n\nCourse Content\n\nHow to design and implement NFT contracts\nHow to design and implement DeFi contracts\nHow to design and implement Crowdfunding contracts\nEmployee Stock Options Programs (ESOP)\n\n \n\nWhat's Already Done\n\nWe are able to reuse some of the IP that we developed for Skillmix on this project. Here are the features that are built and ready to go:\n\nLMS Features: Course authoring, student registration, student coursework interface\neUTXO Interactive Diagram: Create interactive eUTXO diagrams that aid in student understanding of the smart contract to be built\nPlutus Dev Environments: We have an on-demand lab service that can be ported over to Moonar. This lab service can deploy dedicated AWS accounts and Plutus development containers.\n\n \n\nProject Roadmap\n\nWithin 3 Months\n\nShip the Web IDE\n\nBrowser based terminal connected to a dedicated Plutus container\n\nAbility to open remote files on the Plutus container\n\nAbility to edit remote files on the Plutus container\n\nAbility to issue build commands and test Smart Contracts\n\nShip the NFT Smart Contract course\n\nShip the Moonar website\n\n \n\nWithin 6 Months\n\nShip the DeF Smart Contract course\nShip the Crowdsourcing Smart Contract course\n\n \n\nDefinition of Success\n\nIn terms of Project Catalyst and Fund6, the most important definition of success for this project is \"developers trained\". Given the budget requested, this project will be a success if it trained 1000 developers. That would be a cost of $18 of ADA per developer trained, which would be excellent ROI.\n\nAs part of the funding for this project, we will provide 50,000 hours of Plutus learning lab hours to the community on a first come, first serve basis, for free. Each Moonar account gets 50 hours of lab time for free.

While these projects have their specialized use-cases, the internals are all too common.\n\nNaturally, one may realize these patterns and recognize that there are many opportunities to develop common code to be used by many applications. This code, once developed and open-sourced, could be used and improved by the community constantly, so everyone in the ecosystem would benefit from a shared solution. We want to replicate this successful model — that allowed many libraries, frameworks and the projects that built on these flourish — and bring it to the Cardano eco-system by spearheading a framework to create strong marketplaces.\n\nSolution: A Marketplace Creator\n\nNumerous projects are being built or proposed in Catalyst that aim to create decentralized marketplaces to serve as intermediaries between supply and demand, sellers and buyers, server and clients.\n\nWe have identified the need to build a framework in order for people to spin-up their marketplaces.\n\nJust like their simpler Web 2.0 equivalents, blace enables scaffolding marketplaces with a simple blace new, thus cutting down development time and cost.\n\nThis proposal aims at developing a core that will power service-oriented marketplaces such as:\n\nWin-Win Dispute Resolution Marketplace: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368353-48088\nProposals Mentors Marketplace: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369749-48088\nA Tutoring Service\nA Language Exchange\nA Shared Housing Marketplace\nADA Fans (a media content sharing platform only for ADA fans)\nA job board for Plutus developers\n\nFurthermore, product marketplaces (think Etsy, Kickstarter, Ebay) and donation platforms (such as Gofundme) can be built with blace, too.\n\nPlugins / Functionalities\n\nThe Base Layer's core functionality can be altered and extended through plugins.\n\nCore components that ship with blace address:\n\nAuthorization\nCertificates\nCurrency conversion\nFee collection\nIdentity management\nOffering a service or product\nPayment\nRequesting a service or product\nReview system\nSmart contract composition\nStatus tracking\nUser profiles\n\nPlugins can have custom rules and parameters (e.g. fees paid to the marketplace operator, refund eligibility, permissions, identity requirements) on a per marketplace level.\n\nFurthermore, by designing core functionality as plugins, even integral parts of blace can be replaced.\n\nIf your marketplace needs to meet specific KYC requirements, you can extend or replace the identity management solution that ships with blace.\n\nWhile not in scope for this phase of development, plug & play NLP-assisted matching of suppliers and buyers will be central to the accelerated growth and usefulness of blace in the years to come.\n\n \n\nCLI tool\n\nTo create or edit a marketplace, you install and run blace from your terminal.\n\nThe command line tool is built in Haskell. It will be open sourced once the first marketplace using blace is deployed.\n\nSee the gif or our website for a simple demo when setting up a new marketplace via blace new.\n\n \n\nOther interfaces (e.g. web interface) for ease of access are planned as well.\n\n \n\nSupporting Cardano's Developer Ecosystem\n\nBy creating blace, we help developers by enabling them to skip base layer marketplace work and thus decrease the time to launch their Cardano mvp.\n\nThe leading question of the Developer Ecosystem Challenge is: \"How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?\". And we answer: By providing an extensible marketplace creator, so developers can cut costs and focus on the specificity of their projects.\n\nAmong the potential directions described in the Challenge Campaing Brief ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26094 ), we believe we are directly addressing:\n\nDeveloper productivity: IDE's, scripts to automate stuff\nKnowledge base & Documentation\nDeployment, testing, and monitoring frameworks\nSamples, recipes and templates\nSupport structures\n\n \n\nTeam\n\nMeet the key personnel for this project.\n\nOur team site ( https://winwin-team.web.app/ ) has additional information on each team member incl.

I am writing this proposal for additional funding to continue development post smart contract deployment. I have already started frontend development and have a working token sale smart contract deployed on the Alonzo purple testnet. I may be one of the first Plutus developers to have an actual functional token swap on Cardano. I gave a talk and walkthrough about the contract at the ADA Maker Space Hackathon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUvyfrXbwg\n\n \n\nThe current solution for the marketplace will be a locally run react component interacting with decentralized smart contracts and a centralized solution for the market hosted at https://www.logicalmechanism.io This will create a decentralized solution for anyone with the node and cli to interact with the smart contracts as well as create an easy to use website version for beginners.\n\n \n\nThis funding round will secure development funds for the remainder of 2021. I want to release the alpha version of the marketplace with the deployment of smart contracts, providing basic token sale functionality with some additional smart contracts if time permits. As time goes on I will be adding additional smart contracts to the marketplace that will allow advanced token sales like auctioning and royalty payments. It will also host my Fund5 smart contracts when they are released.\n\n \n\nI am asking for an additional 5000 USD to provide myself with rent, food, and bills for the next couple of months to ensure that I can continue to develop in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n \n\nIf everything goes to plan, I will have a working market in 3 months with many different smart contract solutions for any type of user. Six months to twelve months I should have the most decentralized solution for token sales. I want this marketplace to be the go-to solution for completely decentralized token sales.\n\n \n\nBelow is an excerpt from my Fund4 proposal:\n\n \n\nThe marketplace is an all-in-one solution for the decentralized trading of user-made tokens. It serves as an easy entry for beginning NFT users, providing a platform for a low-floor-high-ceiling NFT market, and creates a home for advanced users due to the simplicity of design combined with the great flexibility and customization of the marketplace brings to the industry.\n\nA marketplace without gatekeeping.\n\nAny user may register a token with the marketplace and can start trading their token immediately. This opens a new pathway for selling tokenized objects on the internet. In theory, this means art, tickets, houses, cars, anything tokenizable, could be traded in a decentralized way without a controlling party. This is huge and makes this marketplace more than just a simple token swap.\n\n \n\nPlease refer to my fund4 proposal for additional information.\n\n \n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-based-Marketplace/340007-48088","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368616-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPlease read my gitbook about the CUBI program: https://ancientkraken.gitbook.io/cardano-universal-basic-income/\n\n \n\nCUBI is the Cardano Universal Basic Income program. Users of the CUBI system will be paid with the return on investment from the delegation of ADA from dedicated stake pools operated by the CUBI program or private investors. The currency given out will be placed into smart contracts that operate as the user's wallet, allowing the purchasing of goods from participating CUBI merchants.\n\n \n\nThe CUBI program is specifically designed to help those in financial need by providing a cryptographically secure method to purchase goods. A by-product of the UBI system is the increase in cryptocurrency adoption at the merchant level and the creation of a donation system where the wealthy can help without the financial loss of their initially donated funds.\n\n \n\nEach user in the CUBI program will be issued a digital identity, a DID, that is connected to a smart contract wallet and the blockchain. This allows for unfraudulent use of the CUBI wallets and provides an economic identity to those without one. This does force the CUBI user to have some form of smartphone and/or a debit card that must be kept safe and secure.\n\n \n\nThe smart contract wallets will behave like prepaid debit cards. Periodically, each wallet will be replenished up to some maximal amount of ADA. This will allow the user to purchase food, pay bills, and pay rent. The CUBI user can not horde the ADA for personal wealth. After the end of each period, the remaining ADA is returned to the pool. This creates the incentive to use the ADA within that time period to buy goods. This also allows unused or lost wallets to be automatically be regained into the stake pools, ensuring individuals will be able to utilize the system and not abuse it for others.\n\n \n\nMerchants play a major role in the CUBI program. Similar to the EBT system in the US, participating stores will be able to sell specific products for users with CUBI wallets. The merchants will also be provided with a DID to ensure that each merchant is qualified and a good actor.\n\nA merchant will have a CUBI wallet where each item the merchant sells is represented as a non-fungible token, an NFT. When a CUBI user purchases an item from a CUBI merchant, the NFT will be burned, removing the item from the merchant's wallet and replacing it with ADA from the user's wallet. The transaction on the blockchain is a receipt for the transfer of ADA for goods.\n\n \n\nCUBI users gain the ability to purchase goods with ADA and the merchants gain the ability to manage their inventory and funds from a single device. CUBI serves as the medium for purchasing power and digital identity while creating a financial ecosystem for everyone to use.\n\n \n\n \n\nThis proposal will focus on creating smart contracts for the CUBI wallet and DID integration using Atala Prism. The users will need a smart contract wallet and DID that allows for purchasing of NFTs from other merchant-style CUBI wallets.\n\n \n\nI want to create smart contracts such that this program could in theory be implemented into any city or state. The smart contracts themselves are fairly simple but will require Atala Prism to be fully functional. I want to have the smart contracts done by the end of 2021. With working smart contracts, this idea could be proposed to local governments for an experimental solution for the unhoused peoples of America in the next six to twelve months.\n\n \n\nI am asking for 5000 USD to provide myself with rent, food, and bills such that I can continue to develop in the Cardano ecosystem.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368628-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nOur vision includes Parishioner dApp that builds on the Atala PRISM effort in Education, and a Go-To-Market plan to partner with Parishes across the Continent.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368818-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368865-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nKey Statistics:\n\n61% of the world's workers earn their living in the informal economy\n80% of the Ghanaian workforce is employed in the informal sector\nInformal sector contributes 12 Billion to Ghanaian GDP\nServices not covered in Ghanaian the informal sector include\n\n\nMedical insurance\nPaid sick leave\nContribution to retirement\n\n\nIn 2020 lending rates from banks were 20% - 30%\nFor Microloans, the lending rates can go as high as 100%\nIncrease in unserviced loans in the financial sector\n\nKey Objectives:\n\nCreate a self-sustaining micro lending DAO for the Ghanaian informal sector.\nEnable access to low cost credit options for businesses in the informal sector\nEnable access to various business education resources through the network\n\n\nManagerial\nRecord keeping and reporting\nInventory management\n\nSolutions\n\nThe micro lending DAO will be created on the Cardano network.

Now imagine how difficult it must be when you do not speak English. All Ada holders benefit if we develop better more inclusive and diverse governance processes and strategies. Unless the Catalyst Community and Ada holders level up our collective cognition, a random voting strategy is just as valid as a well researched one.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE\n\nCurrent Problems and Limitation\n\nLanguage differences and cultural exclusivity prevents governance initiatives from scaling globally. The constant experimentation of Catalyst means we need to be mindful to include different languages and cultures. Avoiding one culture dominating the narrative.\n\nMisaligned incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting. In Asia and other non-native English speaking cultures, language barriers compound this. Language barriers are evident at every Catalyst stage. Survey results showed in the Japanese community biggest problem of Catalyst voting was the lack of Japanese support (45.61%). Over %37 of respondents highlighted issues with understanding the process- \"I didn't understand the meaning because it was in English, so I voted randomly\". The weariness of scams and lack of trust between proposals and voters were highlighted too. Another %16 mentioned incentive misalignment issues. \n\nThe Team\n\nA collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:\n\nYuta Yuta @yutazz - Japan: Cardano official ambassador, Community Co-Organiser, Catalyst Fund 2 Recipient, certified public accountant.\n\nYan Tirta @yantirta - Indonesia: Cardano Indonesia community wrangler empowering his local community with education and encouragement.\n\nMie Tran @mie.tran.0407 - Vietnam: English and International Business major with experience working with western businesses and translation.\n\nAndy Sibuea @zicozibu - Indonesia: Leading blockchain education beyond cryptocurrencies and across Indonesia.\n\nTim O'Brien @tobrien - Vietnam: No-code pioneer. Facilitator in East African Townhall (EATH).\n\nGreg Bell @grebel - Australia: IT consultant, writing Catalyst Challenges.\n\nSeomon Blub @seomon - Austria: IT consultant focused on the people-ware infrastructure for sustainable communities.\n\nRobert O'Brien @wolstaeb - New Zealand: Financial systems Software Engineer, Community Co-Organiser and Entrepreneur.\n\nStephen Whitenstall @swhitenstall - England: Tracks and documents Catalyst. Helping communities like Catalyst Circle and Catalyst Swarm organise.\n\nFelix Weber @felixweber - France: Community Manager building bridges between people. Member of the T&M Catalyst Circle/Swarm/School.\n\nThe team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall trusted seed. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm and other community groups across Asia. \n\nOur solution: Eastern Townhall Forum\n\nOur goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage for voter and proposer onboarding. To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them. The focus is on six mutually reinforcing areas:\n\nContent production: Help Ada holders understanding why it is important to vote on proposals.\nEastern Hemisphere Language-specific events focused on voter education and discussion.\nA proposal language translation pipeline to help proposers reach the wider East Asian community.\nLanguage-specific Catalyst Swarm Ideafests as a stage for building voter awareness, engagement, and trust.\nSocial Media Marketing: socialise voter content and messaging across our social media channels; and\nConduct routine surveys and user research to help understand individual attitudes to Catalyst and proposal formats.\n\nThe proposal is seeking funds to help develop a programme specifically designed to help connect voters with proposals and proposers.\n\nTogether these activities form a programme we call the Eastern Townhall Forum. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, educating, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.\n\nThe Eastern Townhall trusted seed are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Listening and engaging with members of the community. Sharing what we learn. For instance Yuta Yuta recently completed one of his many surveys of the Japanese community1 that this proposal draws upon. We want to do more of this across all the communities. We would like to help improve the user experience for voters. Feeding our collective insights back into Project Catalyst.\n\nHelp us improve decision making across the Eastern Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nParticipation in Eastern Townhall events has increased and maintains the vibrancy of the new and regular community members. More Catalyst proposers engage with the Asian community. Even if that is just translation of proposals, content, or DApps for the Asian markets. Additionally, Asian proposers find their crowd. They are able to be funded because there is a strong body of Asian voters participating in Catalyst. Survey results show an increase in voter engagement with proposers, the Catalyst process, and deliberations before voting.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nOur primary tool for measuring performance is our voter survey. We will conduct these on a regular basis across Asian countries. Based on the surveys during and after a fund we expect to:\n\nIncrease Asian voter participation by 30% from the previous funds.\nIncrease Asian participation in Catalyst by 20% from the previous fund.\nUncertainty around Catalyst and voting decreases 25% from the previous fund.\n\nThe Eastern Townhall Meetup is our primary stage where Ada holders and people interested in Cardano can come and meet community members. Through that platform and social media, people learn and feel comfortable going further. Therefore key engagement metrics indicate our success in bridging voters and proposers together:\n\nThe Easter Townhall meetup average weekly numbers increase 25% for each Fund.\nCatalyst Proposals available in four languages (ID, JP, KR, VN) increase 50% for each fund.\nEastern Townhall Social Media accounts increase followers by 1000 new followers in six months.\n\nAfter One Month:\n\nCompleted our first pan-Asia voter survey across four Asian countries (ID, JP, KR, VN)\nLanguage-Specific events – Voter Education & Catalyst Swarm\n\nAfter Three Months:\n\nProduced our Voter Education videos\nTranslated Catalyst voter materials in four Asain languages (ID, JP, KR, VN)\nHeld the first formal language specific Eastern Townhall - Catalyst Swarm IdeaFests. (A test run for Fund 6 is being done to find our feet).\n\nAfter Six Months:\n\nCompleted six voter surveys across four Asian countries (ID, JP, KR, VN)\nCompleted a retrospective on our activities.\n\nAfter Twelve Months:\n\nWe have incorporated the content and practices need to engage with Asian voters and proposers.\nOur monthly surveys continue and show forward momentum.\nOur content continues to engage members of the community\nWe have translated our content and Catalyst material to more languages across Asia.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nAll our source code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 - see our LICENSE file for details.

Better idea flow, feedback and team building should help with creating higher quality proposals.\n\nThe purpose of an idea collaboration tool is to allow anyone in the community to submit ideas or even problems to the community at any point in time that they want to share and get feedback on or to find potential collaborators.\n\nCurrently the best way for people to share ideas is in the insight sharing part of Ideascale which only provides for one week of insight sharing. One week of insight sharing is not sufficient to start a continuous team building process. Furthermore, the insight sharing phase on Ideascale does not aim at matching issues with skills and services that people in the ecosystem can provide.\n\nBy creating a tool for idea collaboration, the community would have a way to add ideas at anytime outside of the funding window to discuss and collaborate on problems they think need addressing. The longer the time an idea is open to the community the better responses and criticism it can receive. An outcome to this should be helping to produce higher quality proposals with more collaboration.\n\nThe idea collaboration tool will allow people to submit ideas / problems to a list of ideas. Those ideas will ideally be tagged and may also have skills or services added by the idea creator to indicate they are looking for other to collaborate with. The community would be able to provide feedback to the idea with comments. A simple rating system can also be added to help better ideas float to the top so more people collaborate on those ideas. The outcome of this should be it can help the best ideas turned into proposals faster.\n\n \n\nFuture development ideas\n\nThe idea tool is also a great stepping stone towards looking at how can we help turn those ideas into great proposals. Once we have an idea collaboration tool we can look at types of different proposals (events, protocol development, DApp development projects etc) and see what type of information is needed to make great proposals in those different contexts. Ideas generated can then be changed into proposals with a request to add information relevant to the type of proposal they are making\n\nAnother area for improving the funding process with proposals is to have different funding processes depending on the type of proposal. For instance, a small budget proposal would benefit from a faster process with less information requirements as it is a lower risk to the community and the need for it could be time sensitive. This idea collaboration tool could help funnel those ideas into becoming proposals suited to these different funding processes. Ideascale is currently the only process used at the moment.\n\n \n\nDevelopment steps\n\n- Create an idea collaboration form to add ideas with tags and optionally any services and skills required.\n\n- Showcase a list of ideas that the community can filter from based off the tags or skills / services required and also provide feedback to the idea.\n\n- Implement the idea upvote and downvote review system to allow users to review the idea and implement a sort by feature on the idea list so user can find the most upvoted ideas.\n\n- Output the data periodically to an open source repository for other people to consume as needed.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nThis idea collaborator tool can be started straight away and has no pre-requisites to get started. The design and development steps above would be expected to take around 2 weeks to complete with around 3 weeks needed for the analysis, collaboration, maintenance and marketing that will be spread out over a longer period of time.\n\n- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.\n\n- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.\n\n- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed\n\n \n\nFeasibility\n\n- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps which will be all that is needed for the development side of the proposal.\n\n- Growth - Marketing will be the most important factor for this proposal. In terms of marketing the tool this will include any of the PACE team interacting with the community directly, using social media, town halls and likely comments in Ideascale to try and link proposals and ideas up from people in the community.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\n- Increase idea flow and feedback - The easier it is for anyone to add ideas at any point in time the more the community can contribute towards what ideas get turned into proposals. Allowing feedback will help to shape the ideas more quickly and hopefully lead to more proposals.\n\n- Increase proposal quality - Providing more time for people to create ideas and get feedback will help to refine the better ideas and filter out less impactful ones that should lead to creating better proposals for each funding round.\n\n- Increase collaboration - The ideas will be created by people who have profiles on the projectcatalyst.org(http://projectcatalyst.org) website which will help inform others about the person. By being able to contact the ideator, it will be easier to share ideas and receive feedback. This should help to increase collaboration within the community on shared ideas.\n\n \n\nAuditability\n\n- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.\n\n- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst\n\n- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e\n\n- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\nSuccess metrics\n\n- Number of ideas and proposals submitted - Increasing the number of ideas added or the number of proposals that were first created through the ideas of the community would be a good success metric to follow. Increasing these numbers can help lead to an increased quantity of quality proposals that have had more feedback and time to iterate.\n\n- Amount of feedback given to ideas - An increasing amount of feedback given to ideas would be beneficial for increasing collaboration in the community. This metric would be a good sign that the community is engaged and improving new and existing ideas.\n\n- Number of teams formed around ideas - Some draft proposal ideas may attract other members of the community to participate to bring that idea to life, the more teams established around good ideas the better for the ecosystem.\n\n \n\nWhat success looks like\n\nThe success of this proposal will be down to it being able to help increase idea flow beyond what happens on Ideascale. Having a scoring system will lead to good ideas to float to the top and turn them into quality proposals. More community members can easily form teams for ideas they are interested in. The ideas on the other hand will receive more feedback than they would in the Ideascale process which further increases the quality of the proposal.\n\n \n\nBudget\n\n- Time required: 5 weeks = 40 hours x 5 = 200\n\n- Time allocation: Research & analysis (10%), Product and design (10%), Development (30%), Maintenance (5%), Collaboration (5%), Marketing (30%)\n\n- Budget = 200 x $50 per hour = $10,000\n\n- Hosting & Software = $500\n\nTotal: $10,500\n\n \n\nPACE Team\n\nThe team currently consists of 2 people with background in software development, economics, psychology and political science.

It will be similar to Habitica RPG but the app will be more decentralized. There will be a separate lore / world on how the RPG side of this app works (to be provided on a separate Design Document) but the general idea is: \n\n \n\nThis Cardano App works on real-world goals so \"Tasks\", \"To-Do's\", \"Dailies\", \"Habits\", \"Rewards\" should be user based. All these terminologies / names are not final and is subject to change. Once you setup your goals, tasks, habits, etc..., then you start the process of actually completing them. You will gain \"Experience\" and \"Native currency or ADA\" upon completing certain tasks/goals/to-do's while you will be penalized for missing your dailies/to-dos by things like losing \"Health Points\" and/or \"Experience\", etc.\n\n \n\nThe exciting aspect that I'd like to fully implement within this Cardano Gamify Your Life App is the ability for users to connect with other users, buy items and equipments on a decentralized marketplace, buy and train pets (a.k.a companion/familiar as per RPG term) (and sell them!). There will be options to create / forge your own weapons and transmute them to acquire rare items/equipments which you can also sell on the marketplace. There will be tons of concepts of a Play-To-Earn model to keep users engaged as they continue to maintain their tasks and goals in real-life while having fun and earning ADA. It will have social network integrations to connect their favorite social media channels as they actively uses the app. \n\n \n\nThe graphic design will be subject for debate if it will use pixel art based style or 2D painted artwork style but I'll leave that to the Graphic Design Team.\n\n \n\nThe idea is to fully implement this on Cardano's Blockchain both on-chain and off-chain. Although if we can't fully do that in order for massively adopting this app for general public use then we need to do a hybrid DApp (we might use resources provided by cloud solution providers). The idea is for this game to have a single codebase but can be played both on Web Browsers of Native App (iOS/Android).\n\n \n\nA separate Game Design will be part of this deliverable that tackles on the game's mechanics. As for the breakdown of the resources needed to built this idea is as follows:\n\n \n\nGame Designers \n\n- This team will just focus on the game's mechanics. Half of it will be based on Task Management Systems like Habitica but more on new lore, battle system etc... It will be a completely new RPG world but still has this great concept of solving real-world problems which will be for the betterment of an individual.\n\n \n\nDevelopers \n\n- This will be a mixture of Cardano Plutus / Haskell developers which will focus on the decentralized aspect of the game such as the in-game wallet, Play-To-Earn model (i.e. if you completed a task with friends then you earn ADA. if just your personal task then you earn just the in-game currency). Another one is like creating your own items for selling, or when you train your familiars/pets/companions then you can trade/sell them to others. These logics lies on the Blockchain for governance. The other mix of this team are the mainstream programming languages/tech stacks in order for us to be sure that we are scalable and able to be adopted by general public as quickly as possible so we need the existing infrastructure / platforms to build with this DApp.\n\n \n\nGraphic Artists\n\n- This team focuses on building the assets necessary for this Blockchain RPG game. It will be the UX/UI and will affect how this game will be marketed to the general public for adoption.\n\n \n\nTesters\n\n- This team will focus on just testing the DApp before launch. The concept of beta testing is mostly used on mainstream games but for a Decentralized App which boasts the Cardano Blockchain as its backend then, this part can be taken differently. We can either, do the same beta testing phase (via testnet) then incentivize beta testers on mainnet launch. \n\n \n\nThe requested funds will be the minimum resources with a MVP product. The idea is to target a full-blown DApp after Alonzo launches to utilize the smart contract functionality of Cardano. The requested funds may vary by a margin. I will be responsible on gathering this team and/or would warmly welcome anyone from our Cardano community who is willing to take part on this idea. If the team is funded and gathered, I can see a 3-5 months development so its likely we can see this DApp by December of this year. \n\n \n\nI am willing provide additional information as requested. \n\n \n\nThank you,\n\nJon","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369118-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nIdeas\n\nFor example, your vanity address could end with your name.\nFor a service provider, why not use a vanity address ending with letters 'thanks'?\nSurprise your (girl)friend with a hardware wallet, having the first address end with her/his name!\n\nSo many possibilities!\n\nProof of concept\n\nThe following address has a sexy end:\naddr1v88l2wgr2nqk97lx6hu92ns94ep855afsvgms7427f9ykcq8ysexy\nThis address ends with specific 5 letters 'adaly':\naddr1q8eh88wvphv06p65qd4q5947ysayppkwfjuhfasg6qewmw8fm975v2vlf2fznsg7rkaz32urld92vq4pn9p8ydhadxlqvadaly\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAdaly vanity address generator can be run in an offline air-gapped machine.

The Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC) Hub - is envisioned to close the knowledge-gap between those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and blockchain and raise awareness about the opportunities they could access through education of these topics and by being integrated into expert communities.\n\nOnboard a maximum of 8 international keyplayers and network leaders, which are established female & queer artists, activists, and cultural space organizers - to the Cardano Community through three educational workshops. Both groups would then collaborate to explore what potential the Hub has for local and transnational social impact.\n\nEnhance the representation of independent arts and cultural producers (including queer,) BIPOC (Black, Indigious and people of color) and female communities) within the Cardano Community and build new alliances and areas for collaboration between the two groups of stakeholders.\n\n \n\nFurther empower communities of arts and cultural actors by building out the GADAC Hub into a Distributed Cooperative Organization (DisCO). WIth a DisCO governance structure, artists and other members of cultural communities can track contributions more effectively, allowing for the remuneration of care work and other intangible contributions. A DisCO also allows for autonomy from governments and other potentially repressive structures (particularly regarding communities and spaces within semi to fully authoritarian and/or corrupt political contexts), including the Game A, zero-sum status quo. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBackground and Overall Mission:\n\nThis proposal will initiate a three-month experiment in communication and understanding between existing Cardano Community members and artists, activists, and self-organized cultural collectives from the networks of Space of Urgency and United We Stream. The arts and cultural communities of Space of Urgency and United We Stream represent various social and cultural backgrounds from cities across the world such as: Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Budapest, Detroit, Lisbon, New York City, Mexico City, Paris, Kiev, Tbilisi , San Francisco, São Paulo, and Sydney. The network's foundation is comprised of subculture actors in night club communities, cultural grassroot spaces, and activist networks for feminist and queer rights in over 114 cities.\n\nSelf-organized, independent, grassroots cultural spaces and their vibrant communities - made up of autonomous collectives, artists and activists - are culturally determined social and political spaces created by and for a community. These are 'Space(s) of Urgency' and they are in a precarious position. Their survival is largely determined by real estate privatization and gentrification, yet these spaces play an important role by providing a shelter for cultural communities that lack support from the state or mainstream institutions. At the moment, spaces of urgency and the communities behind them are very compromised due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only exacerbated pre-existing issues of lack of funding and resources, a politically disabling environment, corporate takeovers, gentrification, commodification, social stigmatization, and marginalization. We see a large opportunity for a meaningful long-term integration of these communities within the Cardano ecosystem, since they are self-organized by origin and driven to upscale/increase social impacts beyond their spaces on a more transnational level. We believe that the Cardano Community and the methods behind developing the blockchain from the bottom up and with well thought out, peer-reviewed research, is more in-line with the collaborative and community-driven spaces we're working with.\n\nAt this moment, there is little knowledge within those communities about the possibilities to leverage their social impact by building on the Cardano blockchain. We see a huge opportunity for cross-pollinating unique knowledge between the cultural actors and the Cardano Community, since the cultural actors can benefit in many ways from the tools Cardano has to offer and in return Cardano becoming part of a worldwide network of diverse subcultural actors and community activists - including artists, musicians, cultural organizers, feminist communities & queer communites - to eventually drive further adoption by young people and those outside of the tech community.\n\n \n\nThe Team:\n\nWe're a group of activists, community organizers, entrepreneurs, researchers, writers, and artists working together to establish a Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC). Through this networked system and platform our aim is to create tools for autonomous, nonhierarchical, self-organized communities to efficiently and fairly govern, track contributions (especially community care and pro bono work) and remuneration, establish scalability.\n\nAfter working for 10 years directly with artist and cultural communities, primarily those which have been marginalized by mainstream society and the status quo economic system, we've come to understand that new resilience strategies are needed - strategies that eliminate the need for government dependence and redistribution structures with little ROI. During the last years, we have facilitated substantive dialogue and debates and organized numerous conferences and events with interdisciplinary actors such as political agents, local governments, artists, and cultural communities. Establishing GADAC Hub is a natural next step in the progression of our work and a method we believe will successfully bring in the arts and cultural communities into the Cardano Catalyst ecosystem.\n\nSpace of Urgency (SoU): (Liese Kingma, Lucas Counter, Heather Brown): Space of Urgency´s mission is to empower the visibility and resilience of independent cultural spaces and their communities, by sharing stories, knowledge and tools for tangible solidarity in times of crisis. Expertise in designing and hosting workshops and knowledge exchange programs, and developing cultural community projects that brings collectives together, builds trust, and fosters deep knowledge exchange for social impact and community resilience. The project was founded in Berlin by a three person core team.\n\n \n\nUnited We Stream (UWS): (Anna Harnes & Danaja Volk): Expertise in marketing and global outreach media strategies for social impact. Project team includes six Berlin-based members. The cultural platform was initiated in Berlin in March 2020 as the club scene's response to COVID-19 and has since gone far beyond that to advocate for the preservation and sustainable development of club culture, diversity, and equality through streaming, partnerships, and campaigns. The global movement has involved over 2,200 artists in 117 cities. The Berlin-based association is the umbrella for the worldwide network of individuals, clubs, and collectives.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLiese Kingma\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/liesekingma/\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/liese_kingma/\n\nHeather Brown\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/ferociousrar\nLinkedin: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-brown-6410a9a/) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/evolayak)\n\nLucas Counter\n\nLinkedin: https://de.linkedin.com/in/lucas-counter-8b39631b1\n\nAnna Harness\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/annakaethe/\nIG:(https://www.instagram.com/unitedwestream/?hl=de)\nLinkedin: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-k%C3%A4the-harnes-2b0051180/) Instagram\n\nDanaja Antonija Volk:\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/danaja.volk\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/danaja-antonija-volk-23778517a\n\n \n\n \n\n📊 Milestone plan \n\n \n\nTimeline:\n\nProject duration: 3 months (December 2021 - February)\n\nStep 1: The project launch will take place at the Frei(t)räume (Envisioning Free Space) conference in Berlin (27.11.2021) - a nighttime culture conference organized by members of the Space of Urgency project in collaboration with United We Stream and the Stadt Nach Acht (City After 8) conference. A major focus of this year's conference is 'disruptive technologies', which should provide a fruitful environment for the initial engagement of cultural and community-driven spaces and connecting them with Cardano & Catalyst representatives and our project.\n\nStep 2: After that, artists and cultural actors - including key figures from the feminist and queer scenes and BIPOC communities - will be onboarded via a purpose-built Discord server. This will be a starting point for building trust in the Cardano ecosystem and act as an accessible entry point where potential Catalyst Community members can gain baseline knowledge of Cardano, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain among their peers. Taking inspiration from the first Swam session online meetings - GADAC will develop in a similar community oriented way by starting small and expanded based on the needs of the community.\n\nStep 3: Once we have successfully onboarded upto 8 members, we'll begin rolling out our program of three workshops, beginning with an introduction workshop, and followed by two workshops focused on specific projects (use cases) within the Cardano ecosystem that can be leveraged by the community hub. We will invite various members of the Cardano Catalyst Community to present specific elements of the workshop program that demonstrate the potential of Cardano.\n\n \n\nTechnical Information:\n\nWe'll be introducing the Hub for Independent Cultural Communities with a mix of digital tools, they include:\n\nZoom: online communication and workshop hosting\n\n \n\nMiro: workshop aid and documentation\n\n \n\nDiscord: for community building, information exchange & consolidating the Independent Cultural Communities Hub\n\n \n\nUnited We Stream (UWS): the live streaming network will take care of the recording and distribution of the workshop content to different channels (Facebook, YouTube Twitter, Discord) and also crosspost the stream via the global UWS network of stakeholders. UWS takes care of the communication campaign surrounding the project to create optimal understanding of the topics and to target audiences beyond the 8 workshop participants.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n🦾 KPIs \n\nDefinition of Success:\n\nWithin the 3 month project timeframe:\n\nLaunch a Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC) Discord server (and give it more sexy name like DisCO of Urgency) and develop a presence on social media (Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) that is supported by UWS, SoU, and the communities they work with.\n\n \n\nBuild up and merge the networks and organizations involved (UWS, SoU, FTR, and Distributed Ledger Technology related) to create a new, strong GADAC Community Hub and social media channel which contribute to and disseminate information on the project.\n\n \n\nPublic launch of the project strategy and vision of the GADAC will be presented at the Frei(t)räume conference in Berlin (27.11.2021), recorded and distributed to the GADAC Community Hub social media platforms (Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Discord) and also via the Cardano Catalyst channels such as Youtube, Telegram, and Discord.\n\n \n\nBuild a communication campaign with recorded and published content from the launch at the Frei(T)räume conference to create interest and raise awareness of the new opportunities that lie within the project. One of GADAC's main goals is to close the knowledge gap between communities unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and blockchain, by feeding accessible information into the communities.\n\n \n\nResearch and design a workshop program format with three different entry levels (basic, advanced, expert) to bridge the knowledge gap and guarantee low-threshold access. Execute the three workshops for each level and introduce diverse arts and cultural actors, including key members from the femminist and queer communities, to the potential of the Cardano ecosystem. Participants from each level are given the chance to choose where they want to start/enter into the program, based on their prior understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.\n\n \n\nDetailed documentation of workshop outcomes (Miro collaborations, Zoom recording) and upload it to Youtube so that newcomers can also access the developing body of knowledge. Content will also be distributed on the other social media channels for maximum outreach.\n\n \n\nSuccessful onboarding of actors from the Independent Cultural Communities hub into the Cardano Catalyst Community, including Discord and the weekly Townhall.\n\n \n\n \n\nAfter the Three-month project timeframe:\n\nStable and growing user base on the Hub's Discord server.\nMaintenance and community management of the Hub's Discord server/community.\nActively strengthening connections/alliances between the GADAC Hub and Cardano Catalyst Community. \n\n \n\n \n\n₳ Budget \n\nUse of Funds\n\nPay four project developers for three months to allow them to work part-time on the project: three months x $700 x 4 developers = $8,400\n\nCommunity administrator\n\n \n\nSecretary\n\n \n\nAdministrator\n\n \n\nWorkshop designer and moderator\n\n \n\n \n\nPay Honorare fees for four guest presenters at the workshops: four guest presenters x $300 = $1200\n\n \n\nZoom account = $262\n\n-> Total = $9,862\n\n \n\n🔗 Reference material\n\nSpace of Urgency https://spaceofurgency.com/\n\nFTR - Frei(t)räume Conference in Berlin https://freitraeume.com/\n\nStadt Nach Acht Conference in Berlin 2019\n\nStadt Nach Acht Conference in Berlin 2017\n\nUnited We Stream https://unitedwestream.org/\n\nDisCo Manifesto https://disco.coop/manifesto/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369133-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe want to reach the massive untapped potential of East Asian entrepreneurs. Meet them where they are, in their country, their language and their culture. The Eastern Townhall wants to establish a growing network of East Asian entrepreneurs. Where they can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other. Thinking global, acting local.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE\n\nCurrent Problems and Limitation\n\nRecall a moment when you realised if you poked something, pushed it or moulded it, something new and interesting popped out the other side. We're here again and this time on a global scale. We, the Cardano Catalyst community are pioneers in a new mindset. A new way of governing and funding. But to make a dent in the universe we need entrepreneurs. People are willing to take a risk, to poke, to push, and to mould new ways of doing.\n\nReaching Entrepreneurs is difficult when language and cultural barriers exist. Local context may also have undeveloped startup funding programmes too. This can result in unrealized startup funding opportunities. Few East Asian entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities and the technical, economic benefits of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology within local communities to address local market opportunities. We want to change that.\n\nThe Team\n\nA collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano.

The event aims to upskill entrepreneurs to develop market opportunities based on Cardano.\n\nThe purpose of the event is to build startup founders and Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) collaborators. We are not building startups! Our intent is to educate. Focusing on experience-based learning by providing a soft way for the general public to access entrepreneurship and blockchain technology without risk.\n\nThe event will happen over four weeks:\n\nVirtual Networking (Week 1 & 2): The first two weeks of the event is about Networking. Getting registered participants to meet each other, discuss their ideas and aspirations. Tutorial sessions will be held to help upskill and familiarise people with business design tools.\n\nPitch and Team-Up (Start of Week 3): All participants come together for the opening event where individual participants can give a 60-second pitch of a project idea they want to pursue. People vote with their feet by choosing to join a team.\n\nLearn and Work (Week 3 & 4): Over the next two weeks, teams start working together. Mentors are assigned. Special sessions are run with experts. Teams are encouraged to validate their ideas with potential customers. Throughout the two weeks, each team will have four 30min pitch sessions with a panel of mentors that help them refine their pitch and Catalyst Proposal.\n\nPitch (End of Week 4): All participants come together for the closing event. The pitch! Each team is given five minutes to present their market problem and their solution to a panellist that ask questions. To pitch every team must have submitted their proposal to Catalyst. When all presentations are given the audience will pick the winning teams. Prizes will be awarded. We all celebrate! At the conclusion of Fund 8, Catalyst Voters choose who to fund.\n\nThe event will focus on Cardano Blockchain solutions and place emphasis on using Business Model Generation, Customer Development approaches and the use of analytical tools like Lean Startup, the Platform Design Toolkit, and Wardley Mapping.\n\nBy the time proposals are submitted in Fund 8, entrepreneurial teams will have formed, worked together, finished customer testing, and developed robust business models.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nThe event is planned to finish on conclusion of the second week of Catalyst fund 8, Feburary 2022.

The DID for the climate impact could be the identity of 8 billion people on the planet.\n\nFighting climate change is probably the biggest challenge ahead of us. Nature is giving us strong signals about it.\n\nHere are some stats: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide\n\nHuman activities have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, amplifying Earth's natural greenhouse effect.\n\nThe annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\n\nWe need to fight climate change by reducing carbon emissions and carbon in the air.\n\nBut climate change sounds too big of an issue for each person. We feel powerless.\n\n \n\nMY CARBON ZERO\n\nGoing carbon zero means taking responsibility for all of the carbon you have ever emitted and you can track and manage it through MyCarbonZero platform\n\n\"My Carbon Zero\" inspires people to take action against climate change. Each person's action counts and cumulative efforts will have cumulative results\n\nTo fight COVID we have masks, social distance, and get vaccinated. To face climate change we can take simple actions that will make an impact. But it all starts with the dynamic DID climate impact.\n\n \n\nMy Carbon Zero is being developed under the leadership of Scott Poynton (see more at the team) and phase 1 is already ongoing and could be found at https://mycarbonzero.org/\n\n \n\nEach one of us will:\n\n1. Know the lifetime carbon footprint - the good news is that individually it is not that high\n\n2. Can take simple action to mitigate it and reduce the footprint - each one of us can take it to zero\n\n3. Communicate it (i.e. in your CV/Linkedin) and get incentives - to enable scale\n\n \n\nPlease login and check your Life carbon impact as well as go through the available resources.\n\n \n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nWe are now developing the next phase which will include the DID carbon footprint, improved UI/UX, and partnerships with web platforms (more below)\n\n1. The Platform - calculate, take action, get incentives\n\n    * Calculate your dynamic DID carbon footprint - in this stage, you will know your life carbon footprint balance\n\n    * Auto calculate or self calculate (3min) LIFE time carbon footprint - the good news is that it will be an amount that can be mitigated\n\n \n\n2. Calculate current daily carbon footprint - based on the country you live in and lifestyle (electricity, heat, transportation, buying stuff, food). This will be part of your ongoing carbon footprint ad on\n\n   * Present ways to reduce your carbon - which will be connected to your dynamic carbon DID\n\n   * How to support projects reducing their carbon footprint\n\n   * Support projects reducing carbon already in the atmosphere\n\n \n\nThe list of projects to support will be vetted making sure the impact is verified. Here are few examples of projects we already work with (more can be found on our website):\n\nhttps://www.huskventures.com/\n\nhttps://www.durrell.org/wildlife/rewildcarbon/\n\nhttps://trilliontrees.org.au/\n\n \n\n3. Share & get incentives\n\n   * Share your DID footprint, add it to your CV/Linkedin\n\n  * Compare it with others at your social network/work\n\n  * Get rewards and incentives through collaboration with corporates (such as travel brands) and crypto models (NFT trees, crypto rewards)\n\n \n\nSCALE & INCENTIVES\n\nOne of the aspects of this challenge is the ability to scale the DID. MyCarbonZero is relevant for everyone and it could be a cross-border identity based on common values and shared objectives to mitigate climate change. MyCarbonAction will scale fast through collaboration with corporates and through social sharing.\n\nOne example is Travel Industry partnerships - the team has a strong network with leading travel websites (i.e. Expedia) and hotel booking platforms. The idea is to integrate MyCarbonZero at the end of the booking process and through that get exposed to a highly engaged audience.\n\nThe partnerships with the brands will also include incentives for those users taking action. For example:\n\nIf a user reaches a 0 carbon impact, he/she will be entitled to special discounts with brands.\n\nOne strong partnership we are already evaluating is with https://www.goodwall.io/ with access to 1.7 million young members. The idea is to involve their community with climate action activities.\n\nOther collaborations could be discussed with Bio & environmental networks, Universities, corporates employees, and even platforms like Linkedin and Facebook where users could post their Climate Impact balance (very big statement).\n\nWe also see potential partnerships with other applications on the Cardano ecosystem, for example as part of a microfinance app that could give some preference to DID with 0 climate impact.\n\nIn the years to come, climate change will be a huge deal and many businesses and community members need to find simple ways to act. We wish to start a ripple effect to make MyClimateAction a discussion around the meeting rooms and dining tables around the globe.\n\nThe key is to make it very simple to calculate, take action, communicate, and get incentives.\n\n \n\nROADMAP\n\nHere's an overview of the roadmap ahead.\n\nPhase 1 - concept development - June - September 2021 (in progress):\n\n- Applying for Fund 6\n\n- Developing the POC including the MyCarbonZero calculator platform, ways to reduce your impact, partnership with the vetted organization to reduce carbon in the air, developing initial content and model, discussions with corporates for collaboration.\n\nPlease check the https://mycarbonzero.org/ for more information\n\nSuccess = getting fund 6 funding, pilot discussions, finetune the concept based on feedback from multiples stakeholders \n\n \n\nPhase 2 - solution build Alfa version - Q4 2021\n\n- With Fund6 resources, we will initiate Phase 2\n\n- UI & UX development - our UI expert mission is to design a simple and attractive product flow (calculate, take action, share and get incentives)\n\n- Alfa version product development\n\n- Integration with Atala Prism for decentralized identity\n\n- Progress on partnership discussions for pilots\n\nOnce complicated we will have a functional MVP that can then be used to demonstrate the value proposition and attract potential partners.\n\n**Success =**Alfa version live, LOI with partners \n\n \n\nPhase 3 - soft launch Q1-Q2 2022\n\n- Launch pilot partnerships i.e. with travel brands and booking engines\n\n- continue product development\n\n- Initial revenue from corporates partnerships\n\n- Additional financing rounds from grants, corporates, and impact investors to further scale\n\n \n\n**Success =**Beta version live with partners, over 10k users by end of Q2 as part of ongoing pilots\n\n \n\nPhase 4 - MyCaronZero Official launch Q3 2022\n\n- Go Live: grow traction based on the key areas below\n\n \n\nMEASURES OF SUCCESS\n\nThe real success of DID for climate action will be to cumulative efforts to reduce carbon in the atmosphere. In order to get there, we need to make sure we can provide a simple and inspiring solution, create strong engagement and scale it. Below are some key KPIs we will measure. \n\n- Number of DID carbon footprint created\n\n- Monthly growth in DID created\n\n- Engagement: users taking actions to reduce their carbon impact\n\n- Number of collaborations with corporates out of the Cardano ecosystem\n\n- Number of collaborations with applications on the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTEAM\n\nScott Poynton - a social & environmental leader https://www.scottpoynton.com/about-1\n\nScott is a real social and environmental leader for the last 30 years.

We need however support to bring it to the next level with a focus on UI, platform tech development, and DID implementations.\n\nThe majority of the funds will be dedicated to the product development that will be managed by Udai and based in Calcutta India where the cost of development is relatively low. We calculate the budget across a period of 6-9 months so it gives us time to progress while also securing more funds from clients, grants, and impact investors. This next phase, working on the UI, MVP, DID, and collaboration with Cardano will make it more attractive for other parties as well to support the venue. We estimated additional funding sources within 6 months' time and until then we will operate with a modest budget as part of our engagement for the important cause.\n\n \n\n- Development team - 2-3 developers based in India. $1000 per month per developer. Overall budget $20,000\n\n- Design user flow and interface UI & UX - 15% of position support over 3-6 months with $1,000. Overall budget $4,500 (A normal rate for Zachi will be double as he is highly demanded)\n\n- Project management $1,000 for 6 months - total budget $6,000\n\n- Marketing and partnerships $1,000 for 6 months - total budget $6,000\n\n- Graphic designer $1,000\n\n- Marketing materials and presentations $1,000\n\n- Content, admin and other $2,000\n\n \n\nTotal budget $40,500\n\n \n\nCHALLENGES:\n\nThere will be challenges on the way to success, here are some:\n\n \n\n- Challenge 1 - making it very simple for users\n\nClimate change seems a huge issue and we are powerless.\n\nHow can make everyone feel they can and should contribute to fighting climate change? How can we make users understand it is possible to get to 0 negative impact? How to make the user flow very simple and fast?\n\nThis will be a prime objective while designing the solution.\n\n \n\n- Challenge 2 - motivate users to take action\n\nPeople need to take action to change their lifestyle and contribute financially to reduce their Carbon. We need to make it easy and inspire people to do it. Creating incentives will be important to drive action.\n\n \n\n- Challenge 3 - Business model\n\nTo continue to grow and scale, we will need to prove and improve the business model which is today based on the corporate social responsibility budget and we need to move to a more mainstream revenue model. This will be part of the ongoing work in the next 6 months. Our goal is to generate revenue so we can sustain the growth.\n\n \n\n- Challenge 4 - Team collaboration\n\nAs an international team, communication and coordination between the team members is essential for the success. This also includes the collaboration with the Cardano and Atala Prism teams\n\n \n\n- Challenge 5 - Partnerships for scale\n\nPartnerships with leading companies have the risk of the speed of implementation and priorities. We need to find the right motivation and process to make this partnership effective.\n\n \n\nSUMMARY\n\nDID for climate impact is done at timing it is needed most and the objective is to make a global universal climate DID. The project already started and we put together a strong diverse team to take it to the next level. An important basic part of the solution will be the development of the DID and connection to the Cardano ecosystem and Cardano community. \n\n \n\nThank you for taking the time to evaluate the proposal. We welcome any feedback, questions, and suggestions. We also welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the success of the venture. We appreciate the CA, VCA, and voters time and attention.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369138-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe are Gimbalabs (www.gimbalabs.com), and since launching our project during Catalyst Fund 2, our aspirations have not changed. Our mission is to mobilize everyone in the Cardano community by creating tools and real-world use cases that ignite the public imagination and facilitate adoption. We envision a world where as many people as possible are empowered to solve problems using the Cardano platform.\n\nYou can see our funded Fund 2 proposal here: https://gimbalabs.com/fund2.pdf. Over the last months, we've had the opportunity to implement what we promised and test our ideas. We have seen how Dandelion APIs support developers, leading to new collaborations. We have engaged with over 30 new and experienced developers, who are learning about Cardano, tinkering with tools, and already launching collaborative projects. Now our focus turns to the organizational structure of our growing network.\n\nFund 6 focus: developer experience and bridging to real world application\n\nEach day, we connect with developers, entrepreneurs, and Cardano enthusiasts who want to build on Cardano. We are piloting intro development courses, creating collaborative structures that support new leaders to emerge, and testing processes for establishing teams.\n\nBased on what we've experienced and feedback received from our work over the last eight weeks, we know that refining our organizational structure is essential. We must provide clarity about what Gimbalabs is, and the opportunities it provides. This Fund 6 proposal sharpens our focus through the lens of the developer experience. Over the next three months, we will continue to share tools and learning resources across the Cardano community, with a special focus on contributing to Catalyst, namely a project pipeline that drives the creation of new proposals, facilitates the formation of teams, and expands the Gimbalabs open-source toolbox for developers.\n\n \n\nHOW we build future network developer capacity\n\nOur value proposition is to provide a unique developer experience through meaningful engagement with the Cardano ecosystem. We want to make sure that developers identify a space that provides opportunities to learn, tinker (incubate ideas) as well as participate (engaging in real projects). In detail this developer experience journey comprises the following:\n\n1: Experimentation with both software and collaboration processes, allowing developers to start learning, to bring in ideas and to get help incubating projects. We want developers to explore as well as to participate and commit to a defined project by creating applications that help solve problems and address business needs or opportunities.\n\nDeveloper training: the next round of Cardano Starter Kits are developer-focused and are rolling out presently. We are taking what we've learned by piloting \"Intro to Development\" and by gathering experienced developers who are new to Cardano.\n\nGimbalabs Initiatives: We are running a series of experiments in how to build flexible teams that can achieve specific goals. These \"mini-projects\" are helping to cultivate additional leaders within the Gimbalabs community, as well providing ways for devs and non-devs to collaborate.\n\nGimbalabs Playground: The success of the experiments listed above can be judged by the number of developers we've helped to engage with Cardano, and we are happy to report that devs are showing up. One of our key priorities over the next few months is to team up with these developers to launch a series of \"Playground\" projects: open-source tools that pave the way for real-world utility. The first such project is underway, and we're looking forward to sharing more over the next few weeks.\n\nWith these formats we foster engagement among developers and create a direct impact on their knowledge, capability creation as well as forming teams to engage in more complex ventures where multi-disciplinarity is required, such as: infrastructure, front-end, back-end, UX design and agile project management.\n\n2: Open-source toolbox for Developers allows ownership of infrastructure, facilitates access and leverage on any tools to explore ideas truly. Our toolbox is always evolving through those tools that were/will be created during the experimentation process mentioned above.\n\nCardano APIs as Community Service (aka Dandelions): serve as entry-points for developers by offering open, free hosted vanilla flavour of currently available Cardano interfaces for new adopters to explore ideas and launch proofs of concept for new projects. These public, free services will ease adoption of Cardano by providing infrastructure for initial setup and testing of ideas, therefore encouraging developers to start building by reducing the time invested from days to minutes.\n\nStartup OSS deployments: We aim to maximize autonomy by hosting our own instances of OpenSource services when possible (and we'll use hosted OSS when it's not so we also directly support their projects) and we'd like to facilitate this task so that anyone who wants to host their own \"dandelions\" is supported to do so.\n\nGimbalabs Playground: Everything we create in our playground experiments (as described above) will become part of the open-source toolbox hosted at gimbalabs.com.\n\n3: Cardano Starter Kits (CSKs) apply principles of Project Based Learning in order to build capabilities required to take the next step to become a Cardano Developer. Over the next 6-12 months, we will roll out CSKs that put Cardano in the hands of the general public. In order to achieve this, our focus for the next 3 months is developer onboarding. The CSKs rolling out presently will therefore be developer-focused, with entry-points and next steps for anyone learning to code, and quick overviews of where to start for experienced developers.\n\n4: The Gimbalabs platform will consolidate all mentioned above in one single source, with the aim to offer the needed space to developers to start the Cardano journey. We have the objective to create an engaged and committed network of developers that is known as a place to go to where true experimentation is taking place.\n\nGimbalabs provides an opportunity to expose developers' work and talent profile as being a part of a decentralized consulting team. It also provides start-ups, Catalyst proposal teams, companies and institutions with the tools and support they need to build upon Cardano.\n\nBeyond the developer experience: Gimbalabs path to a self-sustaining DAO\n\nWith this proposal, we focus on the next three months of intensive developer training and resource creation. Our pathway to long-term sustainability is unchanged. We conclude that this developer experience will enable a revenue driven business by providing consulting through a decentralized pool of talented builders and skillful leaders, equipped to help companies and institutions to build on Cardano. This might start by providing a customized workshop to introduce to the Cardano blockchain, guide a process of incubation and exploring, to implement a defined application including educational marketing to accompany the go-to-market strategy.\n\nIn summary we have explored the idea that Gimbalabs might be a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The \"decentralized\" part is a work in progress, and we prioritize the autonomy of everyone who contributes to projects. Over the next three months, our work will focus on the \"organization\" part: how can we provide enough structure so that everyone feels a sense of clarity about what Gimbalabs is and how it works, while also maintaining a high level of decentralized autonomy?\n\nThe Gimbalabs Leadership Team\n\nAs the core leadership team of Gimbalabs, we are creating synergies across our competencies by delivering within our roles and contributing big ideas to shared outcomes. We aim to keep building a team that demonstrates the value of sustainable, thoughtful work in the discovery of creative solutions. Our team:\n\nJames Dunseith\n\nTeacher, coach, and facilitator with a passion for helping people gain agency in problem solving.\n\nJames creates learning experiences by running development courses, creating asynchronous learning resources, and helping to launch experiments that allow people to contribute their diverse talent to share goals. He is also the front-end developer of gimbalabs.com and is working to create resilient, reusable components that help other people to launch their work.\n\nRelevant Experience: diverse experience in creating systems and tools that support students and teachers to learn by doing. During his 11 years teaching high school math, computer science, creative writing, and bike repair, James experimented successfully with project-based learning and mastery-based grading, showing how systems like these can change the way students approach learning. He was named a Master Teacher by both Math for America and by BetterLesson, where he published two math curricula that are still in use today. Before founding Gimbalabs, James focused on teacher training at BetterLesson and then at MIND Research Institute, in both cases building successful programs while supporting teachers to use new tools facilitate deeper learning, and is excited to apply lessons from those experiences to the project of sharing Cardano with the world.\n\nRoberto C. Morano\n\nSeasoned sysadmin and DevOps advocate and also an OpenSource-everything and decentralization enthusiast.\n\nRoberto builds tools and facilitates their use by ensuring the stability of Dandelion APIs and being ready to answer all questions. He is involved in Cardano projects and testnets development to operate, maintain and support the APIs offered to the community. He will also help with integrating services and pipelines for Gimbalabs and architecting a potential decentralized API solution that helps fund the organization.\n\nIn addition, he will collaborate to provide for the entire continuum of lower-tech to higher-tech use cases. Roberto will ensure that the technical side of CSKs is both fundamentally sound and accessible.\n\nRelevant Experience: Roberto has been involved for more than 10 years in projects that vary from developing Linux distributions for the Spanish citizen and governments, an anti-DDoS systems for a datacenter or web infrastructure for different industries like real estate, logistics or fintech private sector, where he worked on projects for important customers.\n\nAs an early Cardano adopter and supporter, he has been part of Emurgo's infrastructure team behind Yoroi Wallet and Seiza explorer. Nowadays, he is the operator for La RepsistancE's PEACE stakepool, whose mission is to drive Cardano adoption with full decentralization in mind.\n\nJuliane Montag\n\nExpert business developer and marketing professional within the consulting sector, stakeholder management and relationship building from start-ups to large corporations.\n\nJuliane's role is focused on driving the business model for Gimbalabs defining value creation and processes to deliver on the value proposition to both developers and clients. Marketing around developers and how to best address needs and accompany a unique experience is one of the key tasks to be fulfilled under this proposal. She will lead overarching project management and stakeholder engagement, as well as work with the accelerator to prepare Gimbalabs to become a sustainable business.\n\nRelevant experience: Juliane's personal motivation is to support clients, business leaders, family business owners and board members on their top of mind issues and offer open discussion and guidance to create long term value, truly holistically. Juliane brings a rich variety of experience, having led national-scale entrepreneurial initiatives, facilitated strategic planning for digital scaling, and provided guidance for small, family-owned businesses. Her client-facing roles have been centered mainly in Business Development & Sales by serving middle-market, family business, and large corporate organizations. In 15+ years' experience Juliane has held diverse management positions for Business Development, Stakeholder Management, Strategic Planning, Business Intelligence and Global Account Management, working with diverse teams in North & South America and Europe.\n\n \n\nRoadmap, metrics and budget (3 months)\n\nWe are budgeting for three months in regards to our value proposition outlined above.

Developers can also use DARP to simplify changes to smart contract addresses without needing to deploy a full update to their applications.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe DID standard defined by the W3C on which Atala PRISM is built, provides a service property (https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services) that allows the owner of the DID to refer those they want to interact with, to information that may be of use in communicating with them. This is specified using the serviceEndpoint attribute, that can be a URL, a messaging service or other communications protocols.\n\nThe DARP protocol will use this service feature to leverage the use of DIDs being made available through Atala PRISM, to allow the owner of a human readable address (e.g. alice.address) to refer others to a resolution document, which maps their human readable address to complex addresses, such as a Cardano wallet address.\n\nFor those that would like a more technical overview, please review the documentation at https://docs.darp.tech\n\nHow does this service drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage and Atala PRISM?\n\nThis kind of service is something that many users of Cardano (or any other blockchain) would find useful, be it developers building dApps or end users wanting to interact with dApps or simply transfer tokens. By providing this service as an extension of the underlying capabilities of DIDs, it introduces people to Atala PRISM before there are other identity solutions that may be of use to them. This will grow the adoption of Atala PRISM, allowing other identity solutions for future applications easier to introduce, as many users will already be onboarded with a DID.\n\nSimilar services (like the Ethereum Name Service or Unstoppable Domains) already exist, why build an alternative on Cardano?\n\nIn addition to being built on ageing technology with scaling problems, existing services also use smart contracts to store address information on the blockchain. While this does decentralise the name resolution service, it unnecessarily adds bloat to the blockchain with data that doesn't necessarily need to be immutable. These services can also become costly through their use of gas.\n\nThe philosophy of Cardano in building a third generation blockchain solution, is that it improves on the way that other blockchains have done things in the past. This is the same philosophy being used by DARP, to realise the same benefits that the early service implementations provided, but without the shortcomings they experience.\n\nDeliverables\n\nThe requested funds will be used as follows:\n\n1. Develop all the capabilities of a Decentralised Address Name Registrar (as described in the documentation), which will:\n\nAllow users to register a DID/DID Document\nAllow users to register an Address Name\nAllow users to edit and store their Address Resolver Document (described in the documentation)\nIssue a Verifiable Credential for a registered Address Name\nAllow users to update their DID with the serviceEndpoint of their Address Resolver Document (ARD)\n\n2. Test querying the registry, verifying Address Name ownership and resolving an address using the ARD\n\n3. Document the DARP protocol and how developers can build support for its use in their applications\n\n4. Make code used to build a Decentralised Address Name Registrar open source so others (e.g. Stake Pools) can provide the same service\n\n \n\nTimeframes\n\nWork is expected to be completed within 4 - 6 months, subject to completion of support for Decentralised Identity artefacts (i.e. DID Documents, Verifiable Credential Templates, DID resolution, etc.) on Cardano, following the release of Atala PRISM.\n\nOther resources\n\nThe idea for DARP was discussed in an interview with Rick on Cardano Live at","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369152-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nAbout the project\n\nThe Community Landing Page (AKA Community Site) is set up to be a community operated, edited and developed site for the Cardano Project Catalyst Community.

Currently community members can request features using issue reporting in github: https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io/issues/new\n\nVoting can be done by reactions, as explained in this blog entry: https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/\n\nHere is a list, we rank them by effective score, \"thumb up\" +1, \"thumb down\" -1, \"heart\" +2, \"rocket\" +3, the higher the score the more focus it gets, it might result in higher bounty, or changing the category of the bounty. Here is the list of bounties, if you have a github account, come and vote, help us!:\n\nhttps://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io/labels/bounty-hunter-needed\n\nAs the bounty system is implemented you'll be able to submit 'issues' requesting updates, content and fixes to the site through a dedicated interface. These will then be able to be community voted upon. Bounties will then be assigned to most relevant issues and offered to the community to resolve and be rewarded.\n\nSet bounties can increase if not picked up by a bounty hunter. Ideally a cadence is set at the time the bounty is created, depending on it's urgency. In this way a kind of market force is offered.\n\nThe amount paid in bounties will depend on complexity and volume of work needed to complete. This is an experiential process and is under continual development and community discussion.\n\nAuditability\n\nAuditability and tracking of the process is done and will continue to be done in a transparent way, although some of our goals are unspecific, because what the bounty budget will be spent on depends on the community.\n\nTracking\n\nThe tracking of bounties from previous funds can be found in this document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11vywFU4wEh_7aHnBwIL4NHKgXLYKu9MWurICNyloToM/edit#gid=0\n\nWe want to make bounty record publicly available on the website, we are also considering submitting the data to the blockchain.\n\nVisitors\n\nSite usage is another live statistic that we would like to include on the site. A KPI to watch would be month on month growth of users of the site. It's difficult to put a hard number, it depends on the growth of the catalyst community as a whole.\n\nRelevance\n\nSearch engine results - We want to maintain our high results in search engines for relevant topics. We are currently on the first page of results, usually in top 5. We want to maintain our relevance\n\nEfficiency\n\nWe would be looking at ensuring that a bulk of the funds got to community members from outside the steering team. However, internal bounties will be created when necessary and long term open bounties can also be claimed but the steering team to ensure development is continued at pace. At least 80% of bounties done by way of external bounties\n\nTransparency\n\nThe setting of bounties is currently done by the steering team but will be explored how to adjust this over time. A bounty can be set in consultation with the implementer and room is viable for them to be adjusted should the estimated bounty be set too low. \n\nWe aim to improve the transparency by providing reasoning for each bounty.\n\nEngagement\n\nWe are activating community members and engaging developers, serving as a gateway into the ecosystem. If someone wants to contribute and earn some ADA, they need to learn about Cardano and go through the process of creating a wallet.\n\nWe want to engage at least 1 new developer per week. (4 per month)\n\nBounty Interface & Process\n\nDeliverable: We want to have a well defined and documented bounty system with a MVP implementation so implementation of bounties is streamlined and automated as much as possible. This includes a way for the community to influence the bounty level (ADA).\n\nUser Satisfaction\n\nWe want to add a simple way for readers of the website to grade their experience with the website/ article and submit improvement suggestions.\n\n80% user satisfactions score (4/5) is our goal.\n\n \n\nWe want to meet all our goals within th 3-6 months horizon.\n\nPublic availability\n\nThe site is already public, updates from bounties are applied as soon as they are done by the bounty hunter.\nBounty system is currently publicly available through github. \n\nBudget Breakdown\n\nInternal maintenance/development payments up to (we will aim to make this as low as possible): $3000\n\nThese include things like administration, bounty setting, tracking, management of bounty hunters, general management of the site.\n\nPublicly available bounties: $7000\n\nThese are the bounties that will be decided by the community, and solved by the community. A mechanism might exist where long term open bounties will be picked up by an internal dev team to ensure that the site development continues.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369160-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nSee attached deck for further business plan\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369180-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe are building a system that picks up where Plutus Pioneers leaves off by:\n\n1. Creating a space where anyone can develop a deeper understanding and get better at building with Plutus.\n\n2. Building an example of a repository of reusable, open source Plutus components (Apache 2.0 License) that will benefit the Cardano community.\n\n3. Practice working together as Gimbalabs begins to take on commercial opportunities.\n\nThe Plutus PBLearning Journey comprises a two-fold approach: on the one hand our team is providing guidance and learning opportunities through a weekly learning path, comprises by: 30 minute weekly retro, 60 min weekly open office hours and 2 hours weekly co-development sessions. the scope of monthly work is outlined in our gitlab repository (see link below). Furthermore, the Plutus team is taking on responsibility of creating the scope of each successive month - an approach that is taking into account the self-determination and passions each team member wants to focus on - enriching that way the learning opportunity. On the other hand, we will offer the Plutus cohort to \"learn by doing\" by working on actual projects for Cardano Startups and Cardano-adopting companies, which will give them the \"real world experience\" they need to level up. This project-based learning consumes a full time working assignment for 4 months.\n\nThe selection of developers: we launched a application form to identify motivated candidates, please see this form here: form: https://form.typeform.com/to/ELjAlMnV. As of to date we started the first pilot programm with our first four Plutus pioneers (launched August 2021) \n\nStated above represents the roadmap for a 4 month program including deliverables that serve the cardano developer community (documentation), Cardano-adopting companies (Plutus capacity building for own operations/products), as well as provides an entry point for developers becoming Plutus devs building up credentials, establish a network as well as access and develop commercial opportunities. This proposal contributes to make it easier for developers to build on top of Cardano by increasing the number of developers actively building on top of Cardano (+4), number open source Plutus components produced (15).\n\nBudget is considering to fund two more Plutus developers for 4 months with:\n\n- Base funding of $3000/month\n\n- Monthly bonus for achieving all goals: $2500\n\n-- Total $22000 for 4 months\n\nGimbalabs forward looking plan (3,6,12 months) is to further expand the onboarding of Plutus developers under this learning program and at the same time enlarging the network of companies in need of their services, envisioning this system being self-sustaining and a platform of supply and demand, by serving the needs of both our Plutus developers and Cardano-adopting companies.\n\nWe thought through possible risk factors that hinder the project to be successful. The ones we are in controls are the guiding team, James & Roberto. Since they are the founder of gimbalabs, who believe in the vision and mission of gimbalabs and Cardano, it is very unlikely them leaving this project. Another possible risk is not finding suitable Plutus candidates, that as well is very unlikely since we already piloting this program with 4 highly engaged Plutus developers. The third major risk is not finding Cardano-adopting companies/startups. We are already working on a pipeline of commercial opportunities with both companies and Cardano start ups to pipeline projects to our Plutus PBL program. \n\n \n\nThe proposal team is comprised by James, Roberto (both part of the guiding team for developers) and Juliane (proposal lead and supporting commercial opportunities)\n\nGuiding team to Developers \n\nJames Dunseith: Teacher, coach, and facilitator with a passion for helping people gain agency in problem solving.\n\nJames creates learning experiences by running development courses, creating asynchronous learning resources, and helping to launch experiments that allow people to contribute their diverse talent to share goals. He is also the front-end developer of gimbalabs.com and is working to create resilient, reusable components that help other people to launch their work.\n\nRelevant Experience: diverse experience in creating systems and tools that support students and teachers to learn by doing. During his 11 years teaching high school math, computer science, creative writing, and bike repair, James experimented successfully with project-based learning and mastery-based grading, showing how systems like these can change the way students approach learning. He was named a Master Teacher by both Math for America and by BetterLesson, where he published two math curricula that are still in use today. Before founding Gimbalabs, James focused on teacher training at BetterLesson and then at MIND Research Institute, in both cases building successful programs while supporting teachers to use new tools facilitate deeper learning, and is excited to apply lessons from those experiences to the project of sharing Cardano with the world.\n\n \n\nRoberto C. Morano: Seasoned sysadmin and DevOps advocate and also an OpenSource-everything and decentralization enthusiast.\n\nRoberto builds tools and facilitates their use by ensuring the stability of Dandelion APIs and being ready to answer all questions. He is involved in Cardano projects and testnets development to operate, maintain and support the APIs offered to the community. He will also help with integrating services and pipelines for Gimbalabs and architecting a potential decentralized API solution that helps fund the organization.\n\nIn addition, he will collaborate to provide for the entire continuum of lower-tech to higher-tech use cases. Roberto will ensure that the technical side of CSKs is both fundamentally sound and accessible.\n\nRelevant Experience: Roberto has been involved for more than 10 years in projects that vary from developing Linux distributions for the Spanish citizen and governments, an anti-DDoS systems for a datacenter or web infrastructure for different industries like real estate, logistics or fintech private sector, where he worked on projects for important customers.\n\nAs an early Cardano adopter and supporter, he has been part of Emurgo's infrastructure team behind Yoroi Wallet and Seiza explorer. Nowadays, he is the operator for La RepsistancE's PEACE stakepool, whose mission is to drive Cardano adoption with full decentralization in mind.\n\n \n\nProposal lead & commercial support\n\nJuliane Montag: expert business developer and marketing professional within the consulting sector, stakeholder management and relationship building from start-ups to large corporations.\n\nJuliane's role is focused on driving the business model for Gimbalabs defining value creation and processes to deliver on the value proposition to both developers and clients. Marketing around developers and how to best address needs and accompany a unique experience is one of the key tasks to be fulfilled under this proposal. She will lead overarching project management and stakeholder engagement, as well as work with the accelerator to prepare Gimbalabs to become a sustainable business.\n\nRelevant experience: Juliane's personal motivation is to support clients, business leaders, family business owners and board members on their top of mind issues and offer open discussion and guidance to create long term value, truly holistically. Juliane brings a rich variety of experience, having led national-scale entrepreneurial initiatives, facilitated strategic planning for digital scaling, and provided guidance for small, family-owned businesses. Her client-facing roles have been centered mainly in Business Development & Sales by serving middle-market, family business, and large corporate organizations. In 15+ years' experience Juliane has held diverse management positions for Business Development, Stakeholder Management, Strategic Planning, Business Intelligence and Global Account Management, working with diverse teams in North & South America and Europe.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369148-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369292-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) -

Fill in here any additional details\n\n## What is Blockfrost.io?\n\nBlockfrost.io is an instant, public and freely accessible API that removes infrastructure obstacles for developers so that everyone can start building (d)apps on Cardano. With Blockfrost.io, developers can start doing what they love ❤️, without the need for running and maintaining additional infrastructure and tooling themselves.\n\nAt the moment, we have more than 2,500 developers already onboarded in Blockfrost!\n\n \n\n## What is an API?\n\nAPI is an interface that helps developers program (d)applications effortlessly. An API is a software component that makes the developer's life a lot easier, reusing already available tools instead of reinventing the wheel.\n\nBlockfrost.io is a hosted API, this means that developers don't have to spend time building and setting up the infrastructure needed to run their own API. Instead, developers can focus on developing applications.\n\n \n\n## What is an SDK?\n\nSDK stands for \"Software Development Kit\", which is a great way to think about it — a kit. Think about putting together a model car or plane. When constructing this model, a whole bunch of items is needed, including the kit pieces themselves, the tools needed to put them together, assembly instructions, and so forth.\n\nAn SDK functions in much the same way, providing a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes, and/or guides that allow developers to create software applications on a specific platform. If an API is a set of building blocks that allow for creating something, an SDK is a full-fledged workshop, facilitating creation far outside the scopes of what an API would allow.\n\n \n\n## Roadmap, deliverables and performance\n\nWe plan to deliver the first stable version of the SDK within two months from the funding.\n\nThe first version will include 100% coverage of all Blockfrost API endpoints in Dark, including tests and documentation. We will continue working and maintaining the SDK for a year.\n\nThe main key performance indicator (KPI) is a little bit tricky as there is not a good way to track the usage of Dark packages. Our short-term goal is to have at least 10 projects use our SDK 6 months after the release.\n\n \n\n## Relevant experience\n\nFive Binaries is an infrastructure development company. We're Cardano pioneers - with the first Cardano block minted on an aeroplane, first stake pool on the ITN and the first Shelley transaction on the mainnet.\n\nWe are the creators of Blockfrost.io. We are participants in Alonzo since the Blue testnet and we are Plutus pioneers.\n\nWe are trusted by the community, as we have been granted already 24 proposals across several funds in the past.

To get in touch or find more information about us, please visit https://fivebinaries.com/.\n\n \n\n## Budget\n\nWe estimate it will take us 80 engineering-hours to complete the deliverables.\n\nOur standard rate, which comprises of our engineers' salaries, infrastructure costs, office rent, accounting and taxes is 100 EUR per hour.\n\nWe pay our people well because they are both skilled and exceptionally experienced in the industry. And last but not least, because we respect them and want them to feel good and appreciated while working on Cardano.\n\n \n\n## License\n\nThe entire outcome of this project will be open-sourced under Apache License 2.0.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369239-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n## What Unity?\n\nUnity is a tool used by a large number of game developers to create and power their creations. Unity software is powerful, extremely easy to use and widely adopted by thousands of developers.\n\n \n\n## Deliverables and roadmap\n\nWe would like to create Unity assets, that are used directly in the game development, to interact with Cardano blockchain using Blockfrost. The game developer will just drag and drop a specific asset and build the game logic around it.\n\nAn example of a game logic could be that a specific door opens only if you own a specific NFT. The game developer will just drag and drop Cardano Blockfrost asset on top of the door and specify the action to be done. All this, without the need to run any Cardano related infrastructure.\n\n \n\n## Relevant experience\n\nFive Binaries is an infrastructure development company.

One of the viable solutions could be to encrypt the entire document with OpenPGP, store it in IPFS in encrypted format, and allow authorized parties to decrypt it. This solution is far from perfect.\n\nWhat if you want to hide certain information in the document due to privacy concerns, but the rest of the information should be available? Or if you want multiple parties to have different levels of access to various fields depending on their roles in your business process, how would you do that?\n\nIn database terms, this type of granular access is called cell-level security, and some high-end business intelligence solutions, such as Microsoft Analysis Services implement it out of the box; however, these products are expensive and centralized. How would you implement cell-level security in a decentralized network of nodes, such as a blockchain?\n\nMost likely you will move out this document verification process to an off-chain API, compromising the immutability and integrity that blockchain offers while also diminishing the level of trust in your DApp.\n\nDescribe your solution to the problem (continued):\n\nLogosphere (https://logosphere.io) - a Layer 2 metadata side-chain backed by Fluree - an open source decentralized semantic graph database (funded in Fund 5) will solve that problem once fully integrated.\n\nFluree implements data centric security at its core through a feature called Smart Functions which conditionally defines who can access or modify data at the cell level. This way, the access rules are baked inside the data itself residing on an immutable ledger.\n\nSmart Functions can reliably evaluate user identity and user data, because of Fluree's fundamental implementation of cryptographic signatures for all queries and transactions.\n\nIn Fluree, an identity is defined by an auth record, which is the central component of data-centric security. Every query and transaction is attributed to a particular auth record which is derived from a user's private/public key.\n\nSince every query to Fluree is cryptographically signed, therefore all the fields that don't have permissions to be visible by a particular identity are ignored and are not included in the query results. This is a simple and intuitive way of making sure that some data at the most granular level stays hidden from unauthorized parties, while being visible to the authorized ones without changing anything in the data itself., which is the central component of data-centric security.

Developing an open-source toolkit that allows developers to easily and efficiently run an ISO would be a powerful catalyst for the developer ecosystem.\n\nTechnical specification:\n\nThe toolkit has 2 main components:\n\n1. Reward calculator:\n\n- This component is packaged as a CLI program that can connect to an instance of DB Sync and calculate ISO rewards.\n\n- It supports calculating rewards based on ADA rewards or a fixed amount distributed to delegators every epoch.\n\n- It supports multiple stake pools for Fair ISO.\n\n2. Reward sender:\n\n- Because of a minimum of 1-2 ADA when sending native tokens, it is a common practice for projects that want to distribute their tokens to ask investors to send them 2 ADA before sending back native tokens with the minimum ADA per UTxO (learn more: https://docs.cardano.org/native-tokens/minimum-ada-value-requirement).\n\n- This component is packaged as a running server that can watch incoming transactions to an address in DB Sync, check for eligible rewards, and send back the rewards.\n\nTeam\n\nOur team has experience working in big companies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Vingroup, Sea Group and contributing to big open source projects like Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus.\n\nWe have got Innovation Award at NEO Hackathon Tokyo, thus demonstrating our knowledge about DeFi and blockchain.\n\nWe are all also part of the Plutus Pioneer Program, Alonzo White and Alonzo Purple.\n\nWe have had fully integrated DEX demos since June on our Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MinswapDEX\n\nMinswap won Catalyst Fund5 for proposal Minswap - Multi-pool DEX.\n\nDefinition of success/Roadmap:\n\n- 3 months: Open-source beta version of the toolkit with basic documentation that is ready to be used by interested projects.\n\n- 6 months: Polish the API and documentation, release the first stable version (v1).

The painting changed numerous times but each step of its evolution is recorded forever thanks to the everlasting blockchain of Cardano.\n\nThe initial creators, claiming to be members of a cryptic group named Catalyst Fund, divided a rectangular area into squares of pixels. For each of those plots an NFT had been created and auctioned. Then free circulation began, allowing owners to trade the tokens and — even more importantly — paint their plots however they fantasized.\n\nAn eternal contract allowed the painting process to last forever. NFT owners could do it any time they wanted, for a small fee, from which both the authors and the entire Catalyst Fund gained steady income. Each act of painting made another version of SotM generated, stored on IPFS and recorded into the blockchain with hash proving they were original.\n\nSome of the NFTs were lost, burnt or otherwise withheld, making parts of the painting immutable forever, intentionally or not. However, the majority of the image remains in trade, making the entire digital masterpiece a testament of the early era of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe idea represents simplified property market based on blockchain and NFT. It visually proves these transactions could be fast, inexpensive and done without intermediaries.\n\nHistory shows that both collective painting and blockchain games get viral and bring broad attention even from spectators or people who just read about it.\n\nTechnical and business details\n\nA draft of the technical description follows. This is a descriptive text and I would like not to declare any numbers before the project starts and deep technical analysis will have been done.\n\nHowever, some important things need to be declared.\n\nCatalyst Fund remittance\n\nThe project will divert at least 10% of income back to the Catalyst treasury. These numbers will be guaranteed by the contracts handling auction and painting.\n\nThe painting process should start as soon as the first NFTs hit the market. Each operation will incur a minimum fee from the token owner, but will allow a higher payment as a form of donation to the authors and Catalyst Fund. All such income will be also subject to 10% remittance for Catalyst.\n\nPlanned functionality\n\nPlease note that Plutus is an emerging environment and perhaps no one could be called expert nowadays, definitely not me and probably not the people I'd hire to the team. Some of the declarations below might just be impossible or simply too costly to implement within the budget.\n\nHowever, the following list is prioritized and in case that an item would prove impossible to achieve, the next one will be taken from the list.\n\nFeature list\n\nDivision of the image area into plots and NFT emission,\nWebsite presenting the image and choice of available plots,\nNFT sale (auction?),\nSingle-plot painting,\nGeneration of new version of the image after each painting operation,\nIPFS storing of each version of the image,\nOther cloud backup storage,\nPublic contract allowing escrow for NFT trading,\nPublic contract allowing auctioning of NFTs,\nMultiple-plot painting (directly on the image via browser?)\nMonthly released timelapse video of the image history.\nPainting by PNG file upload,\n\nWhile points 1-6 are mandatory, I reserve the right to drop up to 2 features from points 7-12 should they prove too hard to implement.\n\nBudget\n\nThe project requires input from at least 6 people, although roles may be split or combined:\n\n2 backend developers (for blockchain and for web site) 6 months each, $70k/yr\n1 UX designer 1 month, $60k/yr\n1 frontend developer 3 months, $60k/yr\n1 graphics designer 1 month, $50k/yr\n1 tester 2 months, $40k/yr\n\nThe devops part can be carried out initially by the team members. Then incoming revenue should finance growing demands for storage and image rendering.\n\nThe network fees for NFT creation, setting up initial auctions and other operations will be paid by the team.\n\nRoadmap\n\nThe following dates are relative to the day of funding:\n\n3 months: a raw MVP on testnet, with reduced image area, initial auction started and painting contract present,\n6 months: the above equipped with features 1-6,\n12 months: a mainnet version working and generating first revenue, NFT trading contracts present,\n18 months: complete project as described in feature list above.\n\nDefining success\n\nThe project success could be described in 3 stages:\n\ngood: it generates positive revenue,\nvery good: the above and the image changes at least once per day (someone paints),\noutstanding: the project becomes mentioned and/or used as example in changing existing property trading laws.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369553-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n.\n\nThe Current State\n\nIn Fund 5 there were 250,000 votes cast by ~33,000 wallets.

A summary of voting results for Fund 4 and 5 is included to provide further context.\n\nIn addition details of Catalyst-Swarm's evolving organization are documented in a governance section ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/governance/overview ).

This assumes a single maintainer who collates materials relevant to Swarm and tracks daily activities.\n\nThe GitBook maintainer also regularly posts links to updated content on Project Catalyst and Swarm Discord Servers. In context links are also posted in Town Hall chat where appropriate.\n\nA part of the budget has been set aside for marketing - so that the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook may achieve a wider reach and provide insights into Project Catalyst on social media.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelevant experience (identifying information)\n\nStephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects.

This dashboard should indicate which stake pools are up, down, and if network segmentation is a factor.\n\nThe status information and dashboard are served entirely from Amazon S3 (highly reliable data store). Since no public-facing server is required, and S3 is protected by Amazon against DoS and other attacks, the dashboard itself should remain available in the face of attack and most types of network failure. Also, S3 is extremely affordable for small amounts of data; I expect the dashboard to be extremely lightweight.\n\nThe idea is for servers located throughout the world to use cncli-ping to regularly probe all stake pool endpoints registered on the Cardano blockchain. Results of the ping are uploaded to S3 in JSON format. The dashboard, coded in HTML+Javasscript, loads the JSON status and display the results in a pretty table. \n\nWe run the cncli-ping from various places in the world to test different network paths; the dashboard will present a table showing cncli-ping results from each geographic region (ping source) to each stake pool endpoint (ping destination).\n\nFor example, if an underwater cable between USA and Brazil is broken, Brazil-initiated probes might show USA pools as unreachable, and likewise USA-initiated probes might show Brazilian pools as unreachable. \n\nFor another example, if a stake pool is offline, all cncli-ping locations should show the stakepool as unreachable.\n\nThis gives us a simple, effective, at-a-glance view of pool reachability from various points on the earth.\n\nThe deliverable for this project is the source code to run the cncli-ping nodes and dashboard, released under a permissive open source license. \n\nI estimate delivery around Oct-Nov 2021.\n\nI consider this project a success if, after 2-6 months, myself and/or others use the software to host a publicly-available dashboard of stake pool reachability.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369608-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369611-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nStep 1: Build team with a passion for changing the music industry and a diverse skillset\n\nStep 2: Build technical components of dApp while developing plans/strategies and onboarding musicians with high-stature\n\nStep 3: Mint and release CcNFTs!\n\nStep 4: Change inner works of the music industry\n\n*Looking for others to help me fill in the gaps :)*\n\n \n\nBy having access to owning CcNFTs of their work, musicians/orchestras will be able to:\n\n-Own and use their creative property without third-party interference\n\n-Use smart contracts to ensure royalties are securely and seamlessly received every time the CcNFT changes ownership (amongst many other functions)\n\n-Begin to restructure the way the music industry works by relying less upon centralized bodies (i.e. board members, donors, etc) to make decisions regarding content and finances","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369613-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis proposal is part of Logosphere (https://logosphere.io) - a Layer 2 metadata side-chain backed by Fluree - an open source decentralized semantic graph database; the initial proposal for which has been funded in Fund 5.\n\nProblem Statement (continued):\n\nTechnical Problem:\n\nIf you've been a Java or Full Stack developer for a while, you definitely should have encountered various data persistence frameworks, such as Hybernate or Sequelize? If yes, then you should be familiar with the problem they are solving: to make sure that you work with higher level business entities when developing your application, and not spend too much of your valuable time manually crafting SQL queries, transaction statements or stored procedures directly against the database. However, these solutions are typically for relational databases and are centralized.\n\nThat is where Fluree, a semantic graph database, is perfect for, but there is a bit of a learning curve to understand all the concepts and start using it in your application. We'd like to facilitate Fluree adoption for you by creating a business model generator that will scaffold a dApp project customized to your business domain - we are calling it Logosphere.\n\nAdditionally, you can only interact with the data layer through one direction - traditional APIs / endpoints. You cannot interface with it through the other direction which is the smart contract.\n\nThe other part of the problem arises as the Ecosystem Problem:\n\nEven if a project manages to deliver, it can be hard to incentivize developers to try using your product or platform. Growing adoption and awareness of your tool is paramount to collecting feedback and improving your platform. As it stands, there is no guarantee that developers will give what you've been working on a shot.\n\nDescribe your solution to the problem (continued):\n\nTechnical Solution:\n\nSummary:\n\nNPM library that bundles all Fluree benefits of decentralized graph databases and their paradigms into one package\nPlutus/Marlowe library that allows developers to interface with their off-chain data layer in their smart contracts themselves\n\nA Developer Flow will be condensed into:\n\nYou spend time where it counts and focus efforts thinking about your business domain, defining entities and their properties, constraints and constraint patterns\nYou provide a list of samples for each property of each entity in your business domain\nYou create this business model as JSON schema in some graphical editor (we recommend Hackolade)\nYou install Logosphere libraries from NPM, run the code generator initializing your DApp application and in 30 seconds you have the following:\nFluree DB running on your local machine with a ledger schema corresponding to your business domain and loaded with sample data generated from the JSON schema\nGenerated TypeScript interfaces\nBase class that handles all the persistence and state management in Fluree DB\nBusiness entity classes with getters and setters mapping to other entities according to the structure in JSON schema\nFunc stubs for writing custom code, without touching generated classes\nResolver stubs for GraphQL API interface\nValidator that validates your entities against JSON schema\nHaskell library with type classes and functions to store offchain data required by smart contracts in Logosphere\nMarlowe TypeScript library with your business domain entities\n\nDoable? We believe yes! (To tell you the secret, we've been already actively working on a product which will serve as a prototype to the logosphere ecosystem!)\n\nEcosystem Solution:\n\nWe've been working hard the last several months on our solution and using it in our internal product, and once we wrap it up, we will be opening the doors for all to join our two Hackathons for $25,000 in prizes:\n\nLogosphere API Hackathon: Create a dApp with Logosphere API\nLogosphere Smart Contracts Hackathon: add smart contract functionality with Plutus and Marlowe to your previous hackathon solution\n\nMore hackathon details will be released via our socials and through catalyst channels as we develop the schedule and format. Stay tuned for details! Note: team members will be allowed to participate, but exempt from winning any of the awards.\n\n \n\nHigh-level Deliverables (see defining success below)\n\nLogosphere TypeScript business domain model generator for GraphQL API\nLogosphere dApp hackathon (front end + API, no smart contracts)\nTypeScript business domain model generator for Marlowe\nHaskell type classes and functions generator for Plutus\nLogosphere Smart Contracts Hackathon (add SC to your previous Hackathon solution)\nDocumentation and training materials\n\nRelevant Experience (continued):\n\nIkigai Team: https://ikigaitech.org/ \n\nMichael Yagi: CEO of Ikigai Technologies.

As more individuals learn about the pitfalls of fractional reserve banking and how to properly manage their money to preserve long-term wealth, it creates a meaningful ripple effect of hope, unity, and power to the people. \n\nIt's time we separate money from state.\n\nWhen integrated with Cardano, Avocado will introduce every new user directly and natively to ADA and the Cardano Blockchain, including some specific capabilities, such as Atala Prism, ADA/COTI Pay, Project Catalyst, a Cardano light wallet & access to Cardano's DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThink of Avocado as a financially-focused social media platform that connects people who want to share their thoughts and ideas, discuss various topics, and learn from industry leaders. Avocado allows individuals to take charge of their financial future by learning key concepts \"straight from the source\" -> Avocado Official Learning Material and from Businesses, Organizations, Industry Professionals and other Financial Influencers that will provide high quality educational content for their followers.\n\n \n\nAs we grow, core functionalities and features will continue to be built out:\n\n-Follow people and topics you care about. Share content that resonates with you (posts, articles, memes, etc.). Post your own thoughts, images, videos, and other original content your followers might find interesting.\n\n-Public and Private \"Pits\" (think of these as subreddits that support all the various financial interests our users want to discuss with like-minded individuals)\n\n-Buy/Sell/Trade/Swap stocks and crypto assets directly on the platform\n\n-Avocado Official Learning Material. Engaging. Gamified. Learn to Earn.\n\n-NFT \"Badges\" to represent various skillsets, accolades, achievements, and other noteworthy differentiators that deserve social recognition.\n\n \n\nWe are currently in the planning phase of development of our utility and governance token, GUAC, which will be minted on Cardano.\n\nGUAC Token Utility:\n\n-In-App (micro)payments (tips, \"private pits\" (subgroups/rooms), exclusive content)\n\n-Passive Income via Staking, Liquidity Mining LP ADA/GUAC\n\n-Governance Rights (submitting Avocado Improvement Proposals and voting)\n\n-Rewards for actively participating in governance and Avocado Official Learning Material\n\n-Holders get access to discounts, promos, special events, and other exclusive benefits\n\n-More to be added in the future\n\n \n\nWe are seeking assistance from developers and advisors for our Cardano Integration Strategy. We see this as an exciting opportunity to be a first-mover in an untapped market: decentralized social-financial learning and investing. With a working product already, it's now time to integrate the blockchain and DeFi, more specifically the Cardano Blockchain, while continuing to grow the community, improve UI/UX, and add new features and functionalities.\n\nBuilding on top of Cardano at such an early stage will be synergistic for both platforms. It provides an introduction to blockchain and novel functionality for Avocado users, and, subsequently, brings more ADA holders and DeFi users to the Cardano Ecosystem.

The languages will be chosen in function of availability of collaborators, and size of the respective language. We have had several candidates coming from the developing countries had to retract due to Covid, and also due to economic catastrophies happening there due to lockdowns. Our core team of hubs have actually managed to grow, and collectively more than 3000 hours have been put in the planning and execution of our plans\n\nLanguage YouTube Channels already created with first native spoken content available are :\n\nArabic : 260 million people speak Arabic, biggest African language community \nFilipino : spoken by over 130 million people\nRussian : top 20 world language\nLuganda : biggest native language in Uganda ( country of 44 million people ) \n\nSoon to be launched : Dutch, French, German, Czech, Portuguese, Spanish and several other languages\n\nFor being eligible for funding any Languages will need to have at least 1 million speakers to be a candidate for translation, but priority in first phase will go to the larger Language communities.\n\nThe problem with Education is the KPI dilemma:\n\nIt's impossible to tell when the youtube channels will become popular in which country at what time :\n\nthat will depend mostly on : \n\nthe Cardano foundation\nwhere and when will the projected 100 million of Africans on Cardano by end 2022 and the 1 billion people on Cardano in 2026 be implemented\nwhen will blockchain become a hot topic in a specific country\n\nNow in order to do effective Crypto risk Prevention and education, one needs to have enough quality content available to become interesting enough to subscribe on : who subscribes on channels with just a handfull of videos ?\n\nBut given that creating our first What is ? animation ( duration : 4 min 15 ) , namely : \"What is blockchain ?\" took roughly 40 hours in combined efforts to create and translate and narrate in (almost ) 10 languages so far, it will take an enormous time to make sure the moment blockchain adoption skyrockets through Cardano foundation contracts the channels will be starting to skyrocket in subscribers because so far in many native languages there is hardly ( if any ) information available.\n\nThe Uganda LangBassador translating the script took 10 hours for the What is Blockchain ? translation in Luganda ( biggest native community in the country with 44 million inhabitants ), because many cryptocurrency concepts simply don't exist in those languages yet, so he is creating a new crypto lingo.\nThe Japanese, Arabic & Filipino Langbassadors took 3 hours to translate that same script.\nThe European Languages have help of machine translations as a basis so editing took on average 30 minutes for the same script.\n\nIt doesn't matter when exactly the implementation of the government contracts will take place, once the videos are created they will serve their purpose for years to come. \n\nSo the question is simply : do you think IOG and the Cardano Foundation can onboard those hundreds of millions of Africans through Atala prism ? If so, crypto risk prevention and high quality education takes so much time that the Langbassadors hope there will be enough time to be ready for when adoption in Africa & around the world explodes.\n\nAnd the fact that Cardano is now being promoted, and several Langbassadors Local Hubs are formed and growing, show the Langbassador concept works.\n\nSo as KPI, we intend to create 8 How To Cardano & blockchain podcasts , each in at least 10 languages ( Japanese, Filipino, etc... ) so basically we will create 80 videos in total in the 3 months of funding asked\n\nTarget 3 months : min 2 podcasts in 3 languages\nTarget 6 months : min 3 podcasts in 5 languages\nTarget 12 months : min 8 podcasts in 10 languages\n\nVideo editing , uploading, narrating and translating etc takes roughly 3 hours per European language & 5.5 hours for Japanese and Filipino and other non european languages. This comes to 35 hours to make an animation in 10 languages.\n\nSo 8 videos in 10 languages takes 280 hours for translating/narrating.\n\nScript writing and video creation & project management takes roughly 12.5 hours per podcast ( roughly 5 minutes long ).\n\nSo creating the 8 videos itself takes 100 hours.\n\nTotal : 380 hours - all tasks renumerated 25 USD/hour, total budget asked : 9500 USD\n\nCost per podcast : 118,75 USD\n\nEach of the collaborators on translating the How to ? videos is limited to 525 USD/month as reward with an hourly rate of 25 USD if the total time invested is less than 21 hours a month.\n\nFYI : Commercially translations in European languages cost 30 USD an hour ( machine translation as a basis to edit ), and non European languages cost 45 USD per page since they cant use machine translations as a basis : https://blockchain-translation.com/pricing\n\nProject launch date :\n\nimmediately after receiving of funding.

This Fund 6 proposal asks funding for the commercial part of the platform.\n\n \n\nOur Collaboration:\n\nThis translator platform is part of a larger global translating project \"blockchaintranslation.io\" which includes 3 major pillars:\n\ncommercial platform - Safety in Numbers (Fund5 and Fund6)\ntranslator platform - Project CTS (Fund6)\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Translator-Collaboration-Platform/366922-48088\nnews platform (Fund7)\n\n \n\nWhat are the wins and how to leverage this untapped potential ?\n\nFirst WIN WIN :\n\nThe Safety in Numbers LangBassadors developed( and proved it works during Fund5 ) a concept in which quality animation & video content is produced enabling a single animation to be produced in an infinite number of languages.\n\nAt the same time, by translating blockchain education native speakers and professional translators can become real blockchain translation experts themselves .\n\nTranslators & narrators actually educate themselves while educating others.\n\nHow does this mechanism work ?\n\nSNC provides content like Youtube videos /animations and a translation services platform blockchaintranslation.io\n\nEvery commercial translator or native speaker can train themselves with the content the Langbassadors provide\n\nBy doing so they slowly turn into blockchain translators. The choice to commercialize that blockchain translation skill is open to anyone translating 1 piece of content a month ( averaging 700 words ). It's the only 'contribution' asked to advertise their services as native speakers or professional translators on the platform.\n\nSecond WIN WIN :\n\nA glamour model invests in pictures creating a dazzling portfolio.\n\nSimilarly, aspiring commercial translators on blockchaintranslation.io can promote and demonstrate their skills with their translated version of the content on the LangBassadors media while helping to educate their language community.\n\nThis way we create more and more Cardano & blockchain content on the LangBassadors YouTube and other media channels.\n\nMeanwhile general Cardano & blockchain adoption increases. Subsequently an increasing number of Catalyst projects can start finding translators on blockchaintranslation.io\n\nSo why should cardano care about translation anyway ?\n\nWell, the mission of cardano is pretty clear : \"bank the unbanked\".\n\nNow picture the profile of someone that falls under that category…\n\nThat unbanked person has no internet access or at best a very limited and unstable one\nAlso No or very limited experience with applications on computer or mobile phones\nNo familiarity with basic general computer and internet technology\nLikely does not speak English.\n\nSo how can we give that person a fair shot at inclusion ?\n\nA first priority is giving them internet access : That's why projects like WorldMobile are so important :\n\nOnboarding 100000 in Tanzania ( and on Cardano ), their mission is to \"Connect the unconnected\" .\n\nAfrica at the moment has geographically less than 10 % of internet coverage at this point in time. The first requirement to include that particular Cardano Mission profile is a basic understanding of general computer, internet and blockchain lexicon. Every house needs a foundation.\n\nDuring our translations of our first 5 videos the Langbassadors learned that a lot of concepts known in European languages simply don't even exist in other languages. Before someone can actively participate in Catalyst as proposer or even voter, ELI 5 education is the foundation :\n\nSimplify, Summarize. The leap from going from absolutely nothing to blockchain is gigantic. Final requirement is giving all that news & education in their native language.\n\nThe task is vital to lift up the developing countries, the reason why Cardado needs to be the frontrunner in providing those translations. Cardano is one of the very few blockchains really aiming to become the blockchain of the world\n\nFor that you need more than the 9% English speakers.\n\nOther blockchains might help providing blockchain education and content in other english and non-english languages but they only will bother for 'commercially interesting languages like Spanish, Chinese or Japanese.\n\nIf not Cardano, who else would do it for the developing countries in Africa since it has no great wealth as of yet ?\n\nIn the end the basic truth is that in order to be included people need to understand what blockchain and Cardano is about\n\nA level playing field is most needed for non-english speakers from currently commercially uninteresting language communities\n\nBoth education and translation are unfortunately enough long-term investments.\n\nCreating quality content and developing new block skin lexicons in non-european languages are works that take years.\n\nMaking the task even more difficult is a channel needs to provide massive amounts of content to become attractive to subscribers.\n\nResults are long-term and the creation is extremely time consuming. But doesn't Cardano choose the long term path in coding as well ?\n\nThe problem is clear, but there are advantages as well:\n\nEducation is the ultimate flywheel accelerator.\n\nOnce basic educational content is created, that quality content educates for years to come so you can't do it too early, only too late. After publication it starts informing people for years and years after when the quality is there. The basics of blockchain & Cardano don't change that much, it evolves.\n\nBlockchain lexicons in non-european languages will also be used forever and form the basis on how people will communicate with each other.\n\nLet's give those people the basics and the language they require so we can properly welcome them in the Cardano family.\n\nIf the Cardano Foundation really onboards 100 million people by end 2022 and 1 billion by 2026 we need to hurry rather than worry if we are early.\n\nUnfortunately, Short Term KPI's in reality are near impossible to predict.\n\nTruthfully, they are not important in the short run, as first the massive task needs to be completed of creating enough quality content about the basics.\n\nDo you subscribe to a channel with just a handful of videos ? ...\n\nThe need and return for this task will depend on where and when the government deals get implemented by the Cardano Foundation. Once those contracts are onboarded on Cardano via Atala, no doubt they will search for content that explains this whole new technology.\n\nShort summary : The Langbassadors want to offer the commercial pillar of blockchaintranslations.io to anybody wanting to help educate about blockchain and Cardano in other languages. Langbassadors translate to help educate others and by doing so train themselves as well as translation experts.\n\nThe platform offers the opportunity to monetize those skills commercially or connect with Catalyst projects looking for a specific translator on our blockchaintranslations.io platform .\n\nWe hope on the support of the Cardano community in accomplishing that task.\n\nSo as KPI, the SNC Langbassadors intend to create the commercial part of the platform blockchaintranslations.io so anyone doing 1 ( or more ) translations a month of Langbassadors content.\n\nThis 'Find a Translator'  platform will be translated in\n\nMinimum 8 Languages within the 3 months of the launch\nMinimum 12 Languages within the 6 months of the launch\nMinimum 20 Languages within the 12 months  : at least 10 European languages + 10 non European languages\n\nFor the Hosting & domain name of SN collective &  maintenance of commercial  pillar of blockchaintranslation.io for a period of 1 year : 1180 USD\n\nBreakdown :\n\n- domaine names : 80 USD\n- Hosting for1 year : 320 USD\n- Website maintenance-exploitation ( 65 USD/month ) : 780 USD\n\n-\n\nBuilding out the Langbassadors translators platform website promoting blockchain translation services of the Langbassadors ( and management for 3 months ) : 5400 USD\n\nBreakdown :\n\n- Platform design : 500 USD\n- translation budget ( 20 languages ) : 2400 USD ( average 120 USD/language )\n- Platform for advertising blockchain translation services : development MVP 2500 USD\n\nNote : any money that can be saved in the development cost, will be used to add more languages\n\nOnline Marketing budget : 1500 USD\n\nMedium - Long Term Goal : Stakepool creation for each Langbassador YouTube Channel to support translators on blockchaintranslations.io to have renumeration for their translations independent of Catalyst :\n\nPhase one : testing - preparing Langbassador Stakepool - obtaining test Hardware : 1000 USD\n\nBreakdown :\n\n- Hardware : 500 USD\n- Testing running nodes 500 USD\n\nOveral project Management LangBassadors Program ( already 2000 collective hours were spent on general project management and business developments - no funding asked for any so far ) : 2500 USD\n\nMiscellanious : 800 USD\n\nTotal budget asked : 12380 USD\n\nDefined launch date of the site : 1 to 1.5 months after fund receivement","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369707-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nIf built, our project has the potential to add users to Cardano from across the 1070+ institutions in the U.S. and Canada who are already using our library content.\n\nBackground:\n\nOver the past few decades, the price of textbooks have consistently exceeded triple the rate of inflation.1 College students face steep price tags that averages around $625 per semester.2 This has led to institutions to re-negotiate or cancel their relationships with publishers.3 As a result, federal funding for Open Educational Resource (OER) creation with Creative Commons4 licensing keeps increasing, from $5+ million per year in FY18 and FY19 to $7+ million per year for FY20 and FY21.5\n\nWhile the benefits to students have been myriad6, the current landscape is fragmented and the lack of proper infrastructure has imposed restrictions on both content creation and consumption. Even the most successful open-source communities have encountered obstacles associated with building and maintaining large repositories of content. While some of these hurdles are technical in nature, others are more systemic, pertaining to licensing, attribution, and distribution. Lack of copyright enforcement has led to the exploitation of OER content authors whereby content providers charge students for the use of materials that were intended to be freely accessible.\n\nThe number of faculty who are \"very aware\" or \"aware\" of OER and Creative Commons licensing rose to 31 percent in 2018-19, up from 17 percent in 2014-15. At the current rate of increase, it would take another five years before a majority of teaching faculty become \"very aware\" or \"aware\" of OER.7\n\nWe believe that recent developments in blockchain technology have the potential to overcome issues with open access content repositories and further accelerate OER awareness and adoption. Our decentralized application (dApp) is designed to underpin a library of STEM educational content that seamlessly connects content creators and learners while simultaneously ensuring that IP consumption follows the creator's desired licensing structure, all the while providing transparent accounting for every transaction. This will disrupt the current system of exploitation.\n\nSome of our expected customers are already using materials from the library of STEM educational content that our dApp aims to supplant. These include\n\n--academic institutions, of which there are more than 1070 in the U.S. and Canada7 and\n\n--content management systems (CMS) and other providers of STEM educational content.\n\nOur platform will open up a new virtual economy for educators, students, and the content distributors who facilitate interactions with educational content. Providers using our dApp will benefit by their ability to more easily identify and contract content authors and by having access to fresh content. This will allow them to enhance their course offerings and thus expand their own customer base.\n\nOur dApp has the potential to transform how STEM content authors are compensated, recognized and share their content. Our dApp marketplace will increase the options for creator funding and royalties. We are long-term open-source community contributors, and we are committed to donating a portion of our revenue stream coming from sub-licensing this open content directly back to The WeBWorK Project7 (TWP). These donations support code camps, authoring workshops and other community events.\n\nStudents will benefit from low-cost access to a wide variety of high-quality STEM content authored by subject matter experts. Students will also retain ownership and control of the immutable data produced during their interaction with course content.\n\nThe availability of filterable, public, anonymized data and secure, private, individual records will prove invaluable for researchers and students alike. If successful, our project has the potential to not only disrupt the current STEM education space, but also the economy surrounding other types of IP assets.\n\nOur smart contracts will allow content authors to create the building blocks for course curricula which will have perfect traceability from creation through to consumption. Smart contracts embedded within individual assets will make it possible for authors to receive proper attribution and compensation, regardless of the means through which it is consumed. Compensation has the potential to take several forms which we anticipate will serve to incentivize work and open up the possibility of a marketplace whereby content experts can be contracted to create fresh materials. On the flip side, content consumers will also have their interactions recorded, allowing them access to their history at any point in time, independent of their status with a particular content provider.\n\nSeveral components of our system's modular framework are already in various stages of development. The WeBWorK content renderer has already been released. Our team is currently in development on the web 2.0 library database and UI, which will transition from database to dApp during the course of our project. And initial integration with CMS is currently underway with several providers. The dApp itself is currently in the design stage and we hope to begin development with your support.\n\n3 months:\n\n--Develop and deploy smart contracts\n\n--Migrate existing 50,000+ assets onto the blockchain\n\n--Integrate existing Content Management System with dApp\n\n6 months: ready for pilot, hit performance and load benchmarks\n\n--Optimization of round-trip performance. We are introducing additional tasks into the request-render-response cycle, and it is imperative that we minimize their impact on response latency.\n\n--Operating at scale. Product launch!! Partners will begin using dApp.\n\n12 months: optimizations and internal economy\n\n--Economic modeling. Value entering our economy is measured differently than our expected compensation structure. How do we navigate between value-per-user and value-per use?\n\nOur IP counsel, the firm of Wolf Greenfield, will support this project by 1) reviewing the structure for our sub-licensing model so as to ensure completeness and legality and 2) guiding us in writing a provisional patent application for our dApp. This project has never been funded.\n\nBudget:\n\n--Pay founders for 6 months to allow them to work on the project: 6 months x $4,000 x 2 = $48,000\n\n--Server costs and other technical infrastructure = $2,000\n\n--Pay for freelance developers - 250 hours @$100/hr = $25,000\n\nTotal: $75,000\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-13-368\n\n2. https://usnewsbrandfuse.com/College-Ave-Student-Loans/How-Much-Will-You-Really-Spend-on-a-Semester-of-College/2/\n\n3. https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-knowledge-base/\n\n4. https://creativecommons.org/\n\n5. https://sparcopen.org/our-work/open-textbook-pilot/\n\n6. https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/13/pandemic-drives-increased-interest-open-educational-resources\n\n7. http://openedgroup.org/review\n\n8. https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/WeBWorK_Sites\n\n9. https://openwebwork.org/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369713-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWhat's The Innovatio Founder?\n\nThe Innovatio Founder is a P2P crowdfunding marketplace with multiple funding modalities, using the Cardano blockchain to deploy smart contracts and meta-data facilitating the funding of diverse start-ups and DApps in a secure, transparent and efficient ecosystem.\n\nThis crowdfunding marketplace is focused on innovative technology, video games, and design categories. The first crowdfunding model available will be the rewards category, where the investor receives the product or service in the future.\n\nThe Innovatio Founder would be a private company, which will comply with EU rules and regulations allowing it to offer this service throughout all the EU, enabling the mass adoption of blockchain technology in the European market.\n\n \n\nWhat's Gamechanger?\n\nGameChanger is a humanized and gamified wallet that aims to embark end users on a simple and intuitive experience by making it easy for them to develop and use around an ecosystem of DApps accessible from the wallet itself. It has also engaged with developers to facilitating simple, novel, and crucial development and integrations for upcoming projects in Cardano.\n\nGameChanger is helping people realize the potential behind metadata on the Cardano blockchain, offering them features to build applications around the ecosystem. Innovatio's plans align with the use of metadata to anchor real-world data and identities in the blockchain metadata, this serves as a starting point for a collaboration with a lot of potential in the future.\n\n \n\nWhat are we doing together?\n\nInnovatio is developing its back-end architecture where it needs to implement many on-chain and off-chain functionalities to make the use of the platform as simple, secure, and transparent as possible.\n\nGameChanger is currently developing very interesting functionalities that can provide solutions to Innovatio's needs.\n\nTherefore, we have decided to work together to develop these functionalities more efficiently and productively, bringing a Win-To-Win to both projects.\n\n \n\nWe will work together in the development of features such as:\n\nImplementation of external wallets.\nEase on non-custodial wallet creation through GameChanger Wallet for users.\nArchitecture and operation of an Integrated DEX/SWAP\nSmart-contract support through GameChanger Wallet for DEX/SWAP operations and others\nRe-funding system for invested funds.\nExchange of meta-data with legal and juridical information for the investor.\nRepresentation and voting system with meta-data.\nThe representation of marketplace users in the blockchain and real identity with meta-data.\nClient-side data anchoring on Cardano Blockchain\n\n \n\nHow we will achieve this proposal?\n\nGameChanger will develop a simple mechanism so that any user without basic knowledge of blockchain can create a private wallet in simple steps, allowing them to link it to their profile and have self custody of their private key. This will be achieved by using simple URL redirections.\n\nCreating a decentralized self-sovereign data anchoring on the blockchain to allow users to subscribe their data to the platform, aided by GameChanger Wallet URL dApp connector, in order to have objective information to represent legal contracts with commitments and responsibilities of individuals.\n\n \n\nHow does success look like?\n\n1.

The composability of dApps, and DeFi in particular, is one of the unique and most powerful value propositions of blockchain applications. An SDK that allows for the permissionless integration of a DEX with other dApps will be a powerful tool for developers in the ecosystem. \n\nTechnical specification:\n\nThe SDK has 3 components:\n\n1. DEX Library\n\nThis component is in charge of the business logic of our constant-product AMM like calculating the number of tokens in DEX operations, finding the best trading route, etc.\n\n2. Plutus Application Frontend (PAF)\n\nThis component will work like the PAB (Plutus Application Backend), but on the frontend and completely decentralized (no off-chain footprints). It will take care of constructing a correct Alonzo transaction from a set of UTxOs, datums, and redeemers. This Alonzo transaction can be further consumed by SDK users to build a composed atomic transaction.\n\n3. React component\n\nA modern React component allows easy integration of our DEX swap interface into any application or wallet with minimal time and cost. The React component is based on the DEX Library and the PAF, and is fully customizable and stylable.\n\nTeam\n\nOur team has experience working in big companies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Vingroup, Sea Group and contributing to big open source projects like Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus.\n\nWe have got Innovation Award at NEO Hackathon Tokyo, thus demonstrating our knowledge about DeFi and blockchain.\n\nWe are all also part of the Plutus Pioneer Program, Alonzo White and Alonzo Purple.\n\nWe have had fully integrated DEX demos since June on our Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MinswapDEX\n\nMinswap won Catalyst Fund5 for proposal Minswap - Multi-pool DEX.\n\nDefinition of success/Roadmap:\n\n- 3 months: Open-source beta version of the SDK with React component and basic documentation that is ready to be used by interested projects.\n\n- 6 months: Polish the API and documentation, release the first stable version (v1). Establish open-source contribution standard/process and merge feature requests from the community. The SDK is expected to be used by many applications and wallets. Release Vue component.\n\n- 12 months: The SDK is expected to be used by most applications and wallets as a standard way to swap Cardano native tokens.\n\nBudget breakdown:\n\nOne part-time senior TypeScript engineer working in 3 months: $13200.\n\nOne full-time senior blockchain engineer working in 3 months: $26400.\n\nThe hourly rate is $50.\n\nExpected launch date: December 20th","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369509-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369515-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nExpected Public Launch: \n\nThe beta app is currently live at www.knuggies.com.

Our Mission is to raise support + awareness for non-profit conservation organizations, as well as local communities working to protect important natural resources, such as endangered species. We plan to accomplish this through the launch of a cryptocurrency token, exclusive NFT collections, rewards protocols, and a platform which enables cryptocurrency donations + fundraising.\n\nThe Why\n\nAs human populations continue to grow, so does the number of critically endangered species. Losing key endangered species could cause many important ecosystems around the world to fall apart. Conservation efforts and local communities work together to help preserve, and protect endangered species, as well as their habitats. However, many of these communities and organizations lack the support and infrastructure necessary to maintain these resources properly. Due to this, controversial funding models, like trophy hunting, have become a means of supporting conservation efforts in some areas of the world.\n\nControversial models like Trophy Hunting are not sustainable solutions. Organizations and local communities rely on the support of individual donors for funding. We must find a way to incentivize & encourage everyday people, as well as local communities in key areas around the world, to participate in supporting endangered species conservation, before it's too late.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWith an estimated $3 Trillion dollars currently circulating in cryptocurrency markets today, and $28 billion in NFT markets, there is an opportunity to create alternative streams of funding for non-profit conservation organizations around the world. \n\nThe How\n\nThe Solution we offer is Black Rhino. A way for everyone to democratically support endangered species conservation through the launch of a cryptocurrency token, exclusive NFT collections, and Black Rhino Donation Portals which enable cryptocurrency donations + fundraising, as well as reward donors.\n\nBlack Rhino Token ($BRT)\n\nA cryptocurrency token that directly supports non-profit conservation organizations + local communities around the world, voted on democratically by token holders. For every transaction a 10% tax is applied, which is allocated + donated to non-profit organizations, voted on by holders. Holders of $BRT receive rewards for voting, as well as donating to organizations.\n\nBlack Rhino Donation Portals\n\nBlack Rhino Donation Portals allow for users to donate + support non-profit conservation organizations around the world directly using cryptocurrencies. Users receive rewards in $BRT for every donation or transaction made via Black Rhino Portals.\n\nSince beginning our journey as Black Rhino earlier this year, we've established many connections with many unique wildlife non-profit organizations. We've observed that many of these organizations are aware of the continuously growing opportunities in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets, and want to get involved, but simply don't have the required resources to do so.\n\nThis is why a key aspect of our project is to bridge the gap between those organizations and the average blockchain user. In order to do so, we are developing a platform which will facilitate donations done using cryptocurrencies and provide an end-to-end solution for non-profit organizations which will guarantee them increased cash flow from these new markets.\n\nThose who choose to donate + fundraise using Black Rhino Portals will receive $BRT rewards, and exclusive NFTs for each donation as a reward for their kindness. Thus incentivizing users to donate + fundraise. This is a key milestone of our project and delivering it will significantly benefit not only the Cardano ecosystem, but wildlife conservation organizations around the world.\n\nNFTs\n\nBlack Rhino NFT collections are created + curated in collaboration with non-profit organizations from all around the world. Collections are made + released in partnership with non-profit conservation organizations  Proceeds from each purchase go directly towards supporting conservation efforts + local communities in partnership with Black Rhino.

Moreover, as Cardano grows, these requirements are getting more and more expensive (https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/2978). We anticipate that future requirements will be too high for individuals to run such large setups.\n\nProblem 2:\n\nAt the moment, there is no standard on what certain blockchain information sets should represent and what should be included. This means that every builder is taking their own approach to querying what should be the same dataset from the blockchain. This leads to re-inventing the wheel with almost every project jumping through similar hoops for working out their queries and leads to differences in object representation between builders. For example, different explorers show different values for the \"live stake\" dataset.\n\n \n\nKoios API\n\nThe Koios API (Figure 1) will be an optimized query layer that qualifies as a flexible launchpad for builders removing the overhead costs of setting up, running and maintaining Cardano components (Problem 1), as well as offering API endpoints for both simple and complex data through open-source standardised queries (Problem 2). Figure 2 provides a more technical overview of the Koios API by illustrating most of its features listed below.\n\n \n\nKoios features\n\nElastic infrastructure that is RESTful and easily scalable horizontally by adding more Koios instances. The instances are independent and capable of forming an independent branch as long as the health checks pass.\nFlexibility for consumers, giving them the option to either query the KoiosAPI remotely with no software (light mode) or run a Koios stack locally if needed. A hybrid approach is also possible, with a preference for local connection but with failover to proxy (for example, during local upgrades).\nSecurity - the components in use will allow easy encryption/authentication/DDoS control layers and not fall into smart queries causing slowness (one of the limitations if going down the GraphQL path).\nNo single point of failure from three different perspectives - entity-wise, component-wise and infrastructure-wise.\nStandardized queries for Cardano datasets provide an easy way to add new ones, improve or use the existing queries to build on by having all queries open-source. These also include provisioning for cached layers of queries that can be resource-intensive and are not readily available (e.g. the live stake dataset for all pools). This has two major benefits:\na) It drastically reduces the setting-up time cost for builders as they do not have to reinvent the wheel to get specific data from the blockchain (especially so for complex queries).\nb) It will reduce differences in object representations between different builders and encourage a standardized approach peer-reviewed by the community.\nOpen-source and always open to contributions from the community. This includes not just queries for different data, but also infrastructure setup scripts, documentation, etc. Everything in Koios remains open-source!\nArchitecture is carefully thought-over with optimal performance, failover, decentralization and prevention of duplicated work in mind.\n\n \n\nHow Koios differs from other projects with similar aims\n\nThis is best shown in points 1), 4), 5), 6) and 7), but we will try to shortly summarize it here. The Koios elastic infrastructure combined with being open-source allows easy scaling and flexibility for both lightweight and heavyweight clients - it is simple for projects to configure even their own private Koios clusters. Moreover, Koios is not controlled by any centralized entity, nor does it have a single point of failure in any aspect. Finally, open-source queries and object standards will encourage knowledge sharing and unified efforts to solve problems common to all builders.\n\n \n\nWho we are\n\nThe Guild is a collection of Cardano enthusiasts consisting of multiple OGs/current/ex-ambassadors that have continually been making immense contributions to the ecosystem without any additional marketing or financial cost requests. We are creators of some of the many popular tools and resources in Cardano, including CNTools, gLiveView and topologyUpdater along with comprehensive Cardano documentation (https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/). Through our contributions, we have developed a deep understanding of the Cardano blockchain and its components. Apart from our work on Cardano, Guild members have extensive experience in the technology field, with multiple (8+) years of experience across system design, DevOps, system administration, networking, and software development.\n\n \n\nPriyank - https://github.com/rdlrt\n\nOla - https://github.com/Scitz0\n\nMarkus - https://github.com/gufmar\n\nMichael - https://github.com/redoracle\n\nHomer - https://github.com/hodlonaut\n\nDamjan - https://github.com/DamjanOstrelic\n\n \n\nDeliverables\n\nSetup scripts for creating complete onboarding of Koios instances with additional custom endpoints and making queries available on GitHub.\nApproach and work with interested explorer/wallet providers to collaborate and unify object representations, while making these available to the community.\nThe first batch of data queries including all the base queries (e.g. list of registered stake pools), and the most requested complex ones (e.g. live stake distribution across pools).\nA commitment for stable setup of initial core Koios instances run by the core members until we see adoption & beyond. These will ensure live data availability to serve API, and the setup will be extended horizontally by other members who wish to join the project.\nCreating a set of rules for each endpoint to ensure any instance lacking in data automatically fails over to a working instance.\nProviding the same query layer availability over Testnet, Mainnet and Guild (a separate 30-min epoch network for running quick tests) Networks.\nContinuous maintenance and improvements to infrastructure and query layers.\n\n \n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nAs the Cardano community represents the users of Koios, we want to hear and cater to its needs. Hence, 60-minute community meetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis open to anyone interested in the project. These will also provide a space for the core development team to report on current progress and issues, as well as open the floor to the community to give feedback, make requests, and get involved in discussions about Koios.\n\n \n\nBudget\n\nCosts for Koios can be separated into several categories:\n\nCore instances server costs (12 months) - 4000 USD\nCompensation for initial development phase (3 months) + maintenance (12 months) - 24000 USD\nCommunity incentives (3 months) - 2000 USD\n\nThe community incentives will be used to incentivize top community collaborators on the project during the initial development phase.\n\n \n\nMetrics\n\nContributions, activity and the continued development can be tracked through the public GitHub repository.\n\nCode:\n\nhttps://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators\n\nDocumentation:\n\nhttp://koios.rest/docs\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://koios.rest\n\n \n\nSuccess timeline\n\n0 - 3 months:\n\nSetup scripts for creating complete onboarding of Koios instances with additional custom endpoints and making queries available on GitHub.\nApproach and work with interested explorer/wallet providers to collaborate and unify object representations, while making these available to the community.\nThe first batch of data queries including all the base queries (e.g. list of registered stake pools), and the most requested complex ones (e.g. live stake distribution across pools).\nCreate a set of rules for each endpoint to ensure any instance lacking in data automatically fails over to a working instance.\nProvide same query layer availability over Testnet, Mainnet and Guild (a separate 30-min epoch network for running quick tests) Networks.\n\n3 - 12 months:\n\nA commitment for stable setup of initial core Koios instances run by the core members until we see adoption & beyond.

Our core team of hubs have actually managed to grow, and collectively more than 3000 hours have been put in the planning and execution of our plans\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the Fund 5 funded proposal \"ADA news in African Languages\". The team of 12 ( 4 creators - 8 African Language translators ) were funded for a period of 3 months, that will have ended by the time Fund 6 results are in. \n\nThe chosen languages are those who can fund. It's not a limitation, but other languages are on voluntary basis  :\n\nArabic : 260 million people speak Arabic, biggest African language community - YouTube channel with first content already created \n\nLuganda : biggest native language in Uganda ( country of 44 million people ) - YouTube Channel with first content already created\n\nSwahili : biggest African dialect spoken by 150 million people ( and in Tanzania, where World Mobile onboards 100000 people via Atala Prism )\n\nNigeria is among the biggest crypto markets worldwide, with the biggest economy and biggest population ( over 211 million people ), so we produce content in the 3 national languages spoken by 60 % of the population\n\nIgbo\nHausa\nYoruba\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56169917\n\nThe other 2 languages covered under the proposal will be chosen out of :\n\nHebrew ( already a thriving community in Cardano )\nUrdu ( Not only spoken in Togo but in total 260 million people worldwide speak Urdu, a large part outside Africa included )\nAmharic : Biggest African language in Ethiopia, spoken by roughly 36 million people ( looking for collaborators )\nOmoro : Second Biggest African language in Ethiopia, spoken by roughly 32 million people ( looking for collaborators )\nAfrikaner : Spoken in South Africa ( looking for collaborators )\n\n \n\nWe welcome all other languages as well, but those will be on voluntary basis at the moment.\n\nGeneral rule : Languages will need to have at least 1 million speakers to be contending, but priority in first phase will go to the larger Language communities.\n\n \n\nThe problem with Crypto risk prevention & education is the KPI dilemma:\n\nIt's impossible to tell when the YouTube channels will become popular in which country at what time : \n\nthat will depend mostly on :  \n\nThe Cardano foundation\n Where and when the projected 100 million of Africans on Cardano by end 2022 and the 1 billion people on Cardano in 2026 will be implemented\n\n But once the basic education is published, it generates clicks for years to come\n\nNow in order to do effective Crypto risk Prevention and education, one needs to have enough quality content available to become interesting enough to subscribe on : who subscribes on channels with just a handful of videos ?\n\nBut given that creating our first What is ? animation ( duration : 4 min 15 ) , namely : \"What is blockchain ?\" took roughly 40 hours in combined efforts to create and translate and narrate in (almost ) 10 languages so far, it will take an enormous time to make sure the moment blockchain adoption skyrockets through Cardano foundation contracts the channels will be starting to skyrocket in subscribers because so far in many native languages there is hardly ( if any ) information available.\n\nThe Uganda LangBassador translating the script took 10 hours for the What is Blockchain ? translation in Luganda ( biggest native community in the country with 44 million inhabitants ), because many cryptocurrency concepts simply don't exist in those languages yet, so he is creating a new crypto lingo. \n\n \n\nBut it doesn't matter when exactly the implementation of the government contracts will take place, once the videos are created they will serve their purpose for years to come. \n\nSo the question is simply : do you think IOG and the Cardano Foundation can onboard those hundreds of millions of Africans through Atala prism ?\n\n=>If so, crypto risk prevention and high quality education takes so much time that the Langbassadors hope there will be enough time to be ready for when adoption in Africa explodes.\n\nAnd the fact that Cardano is now being promoted, and teams are slowly formed in many LB language communities already proves that it is worth it.\n\n \n\nSo as KPI, we intend to create minimum 10 videos , each in at least 8 African languages, so basically we will create minimum 80 videos in those 3 months\n\nTarget 3 months   :  Minimum 20 videos in 2 Languages\nTarget 6 months   :  Minimum 40 videos in 4 Languages\nTarget 12 months :  Minimum 80 videos in 8 Languages\n\nCost/animation 234 USD\n\n \n\nThe team will have minimum 4 supportive people, currently : 1 script writer / 2 white board animators / 1 English narrator\n\nThe rest of the budget asked will be to fund 8 native  speaking African Translators / Narrators. \n\nEach of the collaborators in making and translating the animation is limited to 520 USD/month as reward with an hourly rate of 25 USD if the total time invested is less than 4 hours/week on average\n\nTotal budget for team of 12 working 4 hours/week for 3 months : 520 * 12 * 3 = 18720\n\nFYI : Commercially translations in non European languages cost 45 USD an hour  since machine translations cant be used as a basis :  https://blockchain-translation.com/pricing\n\nLaunch date : already launched","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369339-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nIdea\n\nAdaly Wallet allows exploring remote NFTs.

Tickets will be minted as NFTs native assets on the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n \n\nWhy NFTs?\n\nEasy verification of the authenticity of tickets for secondary market and verification at the time of the event with the following advantages: \n\nThis allows for organizers:\n\nEasy setting max ticket numbers (if applicable)\nEasy change of settings for future tickets, imprinting of the relevant parameters into the tickets Metadata\nNo need to sell minted tickets as minting can be made to be done by the user \nSimple verification of the authenticity of tickets using our WebApp\n\nThis allows for users: \n\nEasy resale on secondary markets (each CNFT markets)\nAllows collection of tickets as unique souvenirs of special events / entries to exhibitions / travels / ..\nTransparent sale\n\nRoadmap\n\nWe will first develop a simple website which allows event organizers, or traveling companies to create ticket-NFTs via two different procedures. At the same time, we will get in contact with local \"crypto events\" as e.g. the local meetups of next Cardano summit meetings or online events. As Cardano is not established throughout the real world, we will work with event hosts to allow an \"optional sale through Cardano\" besides fiat. Here we thought of art exhibitions in Berlin for the beginning. Also we will try to get online event makers involved and also let the community suggest first cooperations. No contacts has been established now, but will be focused on as soon as funding is set. \n\nIf you have potential partners for early usage  let us know in the comments\n\nHow will it work?\n\nA) A limited batch of ticket NFTs can be minted on our webpage at once and later be distributed as preferred by the organizer. Here all aspects of the tickets (such as date, name of the event, type of event, location, time, ..) can be specified beforehand. This is suitable when the tickets are limited to a certain number and don't depend on participants names.\n\nB) Alternatively, the organizers provide necessary information to allow the user to mint the ticket on their own while filling in a form with e.g. Name, country of residence, ... \n\nPossible options which can be imprinted into the NFT can then be:\n\nTime until it is possible to mint,\nBonding curve,\nMax ticket number (might also be unlimited for e.g. online events or train / bus tickets)\nWhich data is needed to be provided by the buyer (e.g. name, country of residence, time of travel, ...)\n\nFor each event, the event-participant will find a simple webpage, where he / she can buy or mint their ticket with providing datum if necessary. Via smart contract, which allows automatic processing of the NFT to the user, the money will be forwarded to the event-organizer and a small fee will be applied to our team. \n\nAt the time of the event, the NFT can be verified by policy ID and metadata via Web application or mobile applications. \n\nWhat is our longtime goal?\n\nOur goal is to finally establish ticket systems for different use cases and become a platform of trust for ticket sales for e.g. \n\nFestivals\nConcerts,\nGalleries and exhibitions\nAuctions\nOnline Events (as Cardano Summits)\nCourses (education)\nTransport (Ferry, train, bus, plane\nMuseums \nTouristic tours and full travel packages\npolitical summits\nother political or social events of any kind \ncontact us for further ideas, e.g. already having some organizer / company in mind which we might get in touch with\n\n \n\nTIMEPLAN: \n\nFirst we will work together with a few companies and small event hosts, and later open up an automated option for companies to create NFTs-ticket sales without our review process.\n\n-> within the first 3 months:\n\nCreate the smart contracts used, validate them and set up a webpage. Get in contact with potential event hosts.\n\n-> within the first 6 months:\n\nCreate test events and mint first tickets / allow minting and testing of different types of tickets, establish connections to event hosts for events in the next \n\n-> within the first 12 months:\n\nHost the first events and subsequently open up the platform for various event-hosts and users, distribute validation webapps / mobile application for event hosts and allow automatic minting and event hosting.\n\n \n\nFUNDING:\n\n9000 Plutus dev for 3 months.

We want to unleash the transformational capabilities and power of Cardano blockchain in the consumer world. This can be done by:\n\ncreating a Cardano-metadata-powered system that will keep track of document hashes and relevant metadata;\n\nadding a private database layer for optional document storage;\n\nproviding all relevant functionalities via a beautiful, and UX-optimised web portal;\n\nabstracting away from the challenges of registering a crypto exchange account, undergoing KYC/AML, buying crypto, setting up a wallet and learning to transact on the blockchain. Users should be able to pay via traditional payment gateways (in addition / alternative to crypto payments of course). First they need to feel the utility. Once they do they will yearn to know more about the underlying technology which we will comprehensively discuss. This will drive adoption in a more efficient way.\n\n \n\nFeatures\n\nOur trusted solution based on Cardano metadata will enable to securely manage document 1) ingest, 2) storage and 3) verification process, initialised by consumers or business transaction parties. The portal will enable the following key features and functions:\n\n* Full and secure control over any digital asset and its versioning without the possibility of unauthorised change or replacement;\n\n* Blockchain-guaranteed document integrity;\n\n* Full data history without possibility to change it over time;\n\n* Registration on public Cardano blockchain platform;\n\n* Transparency for all parties of digital assets exchange.\n\nFeatures such as control over publication, storage, and sharing of immutable documents allows clients to ensure document authenticity and asset provenance, especially for documents which must be trusted for a long time-horizon.\n\n \n\nBenefits\n\nFor companies: cost and time efficiency, increased trust with fast authentication and validation, increasing the credibility of services.\n\n \n\nFor consumers: Full privacy and security of high-value information, fraud protection against counterfeit and falsification of documents and fake messages.\n\n \n\nSample Scenarios\n\n1. Protection against phishing attacks;\n\n2. Compliance with EU's Durable Medium regulations;\n\n3. Protection against dishonest business partners.\n\n \n\nConsumers all around the world get their bills and contract documents from issuers (banks, telco operators, utility providers etc.) every day. Hackers and dishonest business partners forge documents (pdfs or hard copies) and place urgent calls for payments of penalties for non-existing services. Consumers can't perform quick checks if the document is true or false. The same situation is with SMS or various widely used social communicators. They simply do as instructed. After fraud takes place, it is practically impossible to get the money back.  \n\n \n\nIndustry use cases \n\nTimestamping, updates, verification, circulation, data reconciliation, contract management for a variety of industries and documents:\n\nBanking – e.g. transfer confirmations, contracts, terms of use, pricing lists, policies specification etc.\n\nInsurance – e.g. policies terms, contracts, pricing lists, insurance certificates, claims, reinsurance etc.\n\nEducation – e.g. diplomas, certificates, training completion proofs etc.\n\nGovernment – e.g. identity documents, ownership certificates (land, house, flat, business, patents, copyrights), grants, taxes etc.\n\nBroker Dealers – e.g. transaction lists, order confirmations, pricing lists, identity documents etc.\n\nPharma – e.g. expiry dates, clinical trials data, drug approval certificates etc.\n\nKYC providers – e.g. identity documents, terms of use etc.\n\nLegal – e.g. notarised true copies confirmations, virtual data rooms (VDRs) in M&A processes etc.\n\n \n\nRoadmap \n\nPHASE 1: porting (approx. 35 days) \n\nSince we already have a related prototype of a blockchain-based document verification platform, the first step would be to port the core of the prototype to Cardano from the current private-blockchain backend. The platform allows for verifying 3 types of documents:\n\npublic electronic documents such as price lists, terms of use etc. \n\nprivate electronic documents such as invoices, letters of credit, bank transfers, insurance certificates etc. \n\nprivate paper documents which are the same as private electronic however in a physical paper format. \n\n \n\nThe platform is by design compliant with EU \"Durable Medium\" regulation and allows to protect the customer (individuals and businesses) from both third-party scammers as well as from dishonest business partners and corporations.\n\n \n\nPHASE 2: development (approx. 55 days) \n\nAdd relevant, new functionalities such as: \n\npayment gateways;\nFiat – ADA conversion module; \nenterprise APIs for bulk uploads;\ndocument analytics.\n\n \n\nand develop further existing functionalities such as: \n\nmore comprehensive upload screen;\n\nsharing options;\n\nUI / UX improvements;\n\nlanguages update of the interface (currently 14 languages that given improvements and new functionalities will be in need of update).\n\n \n\nPHASE 3: Pre-commercialisation and beta testing (approx. 90 days) \n\nThe client acquisition would be two-fold: 1) integration with 1 big enterprise that needs to comply by law with \"Durable Medium\" regulations 2) digital promotion of the service among individuals / SME users that need a digital proof of document or action for facilitating their economic activity.\n\nThat phase will be used for life testing of the platform as well as collecting experience from enterprises and consumers. At the end we will analyse the results and prepare final changes and desired budget for launching full commercial version of the solution. \n\n \n\nPHASE 4: Commercialisation \n\nThe commercialization plan will be based on the following assumptions:\n\n* Acquiring a trusted Partner with recognizable brand to strengthen our marketing message and trust to our service on the market.\n\n* Launching periodic digital marketing campaigns with Partner in social media and information portals.\n\n* Acquiring min. 5 large partners (e.g. financial institutions, telecoms, utility providers) for joint activities who have a customer base and periodically provide them with documents that can be verified, such as invoices, terms of services and their changes, bank statements, demands for payment, etc.\n\n* Acquiring couriers and B2B/B2C on-line retailers (amazon.com, aliexpress.com, allegro.pl) to enable consumers verify messages and documents received from them.\n\nThe commercialization phase will be implemented after A series round funding. On a basis of PoC on Cardano we will choose countries with the fastest market adoption. \n\n \n\nBudget spending (USD)\n\nWe plan the following funding split:\n\nPayroll and contracting fees for developers & analysts – 30 000;\nProject administration (PMO, cloud service & support) - 10 000;\nPre-launch testing and final corrections – 3 000;\nMarket launch & go-live and promotion activities – 12 000;\nMarket monitoring, platform stabilisation – 5 000. \n\n \n\nOur KPI's\n\nWe plan to achieve the following project assumptions:\n\nAcquire 2 enterprise class clients;\nAcquire 5 000 users (consumers);\n\n \n\nSuccess definition\n\nAfter 3 months: Commercial beta ready for launch\n\nAfter 6 months: Product launched and running in beta-mode for 2-3 months, insights from first clients incorporated into the product, main marketing campaigns ongoing, first public non-beta users, customer-support processes streamlined\n\nAfter 12 months: KPI from above met\n\n \n\nExpected public launch date\n\nmid November - Catalyst results\n\n01.03.22 - Public launch\n\n \n\nBlocking problem\n\nTop 3 Industry consumers vector phishing attacks in Q1 2021:\n\nSaas/WebMail – 19,06%\n\nFinancial institutions – 24,5%\n\nSocial media – 23,6%\n\n \n\nCosts of the problem\n\nOnly in the USA identity frauds costed 56 billion USD in 2020 and 49 million consumers was falling victim, which give an average of 1 142,9 USD per victim*.\n\nAccordingly to AU government entity ACCC (Australian Competition&Consumers Commission) in 2021 (YTD August) in the list of Top 10 Scams by amount lost the first 3 positions are**:\n\n1 – Investment scams (bogus investment opt.) ca. 96 M $\n\n2 – Dating & romance portals ca. 32 M $\n\n3 – False billing ca. 15 M $\n\n \n\nEvidence\n\nConsumers lost $56 billion to identity fraud last year (cnbc.com) *\n\n \n\nAccording to the Anti-Phishing Working Group's Phishing Activity Trends Report, the average wire-transfer loss from BEC (business email compromise) attacks in the second quarter of 2020 was $80,183.

Right now, you need to run a full Cardano node to interact with PAB.\n\n \n\n## Deliverables and roadmap\n\nWe would like to build a version of PAB that will, instead of having to talk to full node, interact with Blockfrost API. That way, developers building on Cardano will be able to take full advantage of PAB without having to run, maintain and monitor full node infrastructure.\n\nWe will release the first version of this software within two months after funding. This first release will be composed of a functional PAB node integration with Blockfrost API, documentation and relevant tests.

Introduction\n\nEvery year more and more personal data is getting collected by corporations and governments all around the world. Storage of real identity - wallet pairs in centralized databases poses considerable risks for crypto assets owners. This happens, for example, when a user sends crypto assets from a centralized exchange, such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, to a personal wallet. There should be an option available for Cardano users to remain pseudonymous or to disconnect their real-world identities from their assets while remaining compliant with the laws of their respective jurisdictions.\n\nWhile several already existing privacy solutions (e.g., Tornado Cash, Monero, or ZCash) may eventually become accessible on Cardano through cross-chain bridges, using them would be costly and inconvenient for Cardano users. A native private transaction protocol built specifically for Cardano would be a more efficient and practical solution. The protocol we are building relies on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs: it breaks the link between the sender and the receiver of assets on Cardano Blockchain, enabling private transactions. Our dapp called Cardano Mixer will serve as a nice user-friendly frontend for the protocol.\n\n2. Protocol\n\nHere are some technical details about the protocol. For the first version of the protocol, we are using zkSNARK construction by J. Groth, as it still seems to be the overall best choice for this type of application. The dapp UX would be somewhat similar to Tornado Cash: there will be options to choose the mixing amount, to deposit and withdraw crypto assets, to receive anonymity mining rewards, and to generate your transaction report (with different levels of detail). Our protocol, however, is quite different on the backend as Cardano blockchain uses a different accounting model and has a different native programming language. As for the protocol token, our main objectives are maximal decentralization,  sufficient incentives for anonymity miners, and liquidity (the token design is not yet finalized).\n\nThe complete description of the protocol will be released as a whitepaper by the end of September (first version). In particular, it will cover\n\nHow off-chain and on-chain code of our protocol works;\nThe specification of deposit/withdrawal transactions;\nThe specification of the protocol token and our reasoning of why it will stimulate the adoption of the application.\n\nBesides that, we hope the whitepaper and the subsequent source code release on Github will provide useful insights for the developers' community on building smart contracts focused on zero-knowledge in Cardano's EUTXO model.\n\n3. Roadmap\n\nHere is our roadmap (as of August 2021).\n\nSeptember            - Whitepaper release;\nOctober                 - Github initial source code release and testnet deployment;\nNovember             - Trusted setup ceremony and mainnet release;\nDecember             - Implementation of governance mechanisms;\n1st quarter 2022  - Release of additional quality of life features.\n\nExpected launch date: before December 1st, 2021.\n\nDefinition of success\n\nafter 3 months is to have at least 500-700 users participating in the trusted setup ceremony;\nafter 6 months is for the protocol to be running smoothly with governance and quality of life features such as transaction report generation for compliance purposes;\nafter 12 months is to grow the userbase into thousands, as we expect there is such demand potential, and to implement integrations with other dapps that could use our privacy features.\n\n4. Budget requirements\n\nUp to 12-15k USD will be reserved for a code audit of the most critical parts of the protocol. Additional audits may be initiated later using the protocol treasury once it is fully up and running.\n\nAbout 300-500 USD will be directed towards covering the development and maintenance costs (some software, domain acquisition, etc.).\n\nUp to 3k USD will cover the costs of UI design.\n\nFinally, 12-15k USD will be paid to the developers to go full-time on this project (November-December), which should keep us on track in terms of the roadmap and ensure better code quality.\n\nTotal requested funds: 30000 USD\n\n5.

The outlined assessment and reporting-service goes far beyond core-technology risks and CyberSecurity. Step-by-step we want to address all the 'complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components' by implementing a professional risk assessment process following the ISO 31000 industry-standard. We consider this to be a key-element in further growing CARDANO's unique reliability reputation.\n\nimpact / Return of Intention: By creating a simple but effective mechanism for identifying complex CARDANO-related risks and opportunities, we are directly addressing this challenge setting. In addition, we combine the mere risk assessment with a smart way of visualizing (Risk Radar). Furthermore we want to utilize the reputation of senior experts from industry, economy and society at the reporting frontline. This way we can deliver important improvement impulses to the CARDANO community and send strong trust-building signals to commercial users and the general public (find more details below).\nFeasibility and likelihood to succeed: The core-proposer, Heinz Gassner, has more than 30 years of experience in leadership positions within industry (see LinkedIn Link above). This background provides access to a strong network of highly capable experts in many areas of technology, economy and innovation. For delivering this proposal, a diverse team of inter-disciplinary contributors from industry-, university, regulatory partners and specific subject-matter-experts will be established. Our determination is to provide this later-on as a recurring service in close collaboration with CARDANO Foundation, IOHK, existing quality- and CyberSecurity-partners and other key-entities of the CARDANO Community (find more details below).\nAuditability: Fund 6 is intended to fund the development of our Service-MVP, including the delivery of 2 live examples of a quarterly reporting to the community. We have defined tangible milestones along this Fund 6 journey. For transparency reasons we are establishing, maintaining and visualizing our Business Model Canvas, Activity Backlog and Kanban-Boards in MIRO. The successful deliveries according to our Fund 6 goals will be crucial to convince the CARDANO Community to install our DLT-360 RISK RADAR as a quarterly recurring service format later-on (find more details below).\n\n \n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nVision and Strategy\n\nToday's Fortune 500 companies are all operating professional risk-assessment and risk-management systems. This can be easily expanded with scouting for improvement opportunities. By establishing a multidimensional risk-assessment and improvement-radar, we want to contribute to CARDANO's unique reliability reputation - very valuable for attracting high-potential industrial, commercial and public users. The outlined risk assessment of the CARDANO DLT-360 Radar goes far beyond core-technology risks and CyberSecurity. Step-by-step we plan to address all the 'complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components'.\n\nThe Radar-Screen-Reporting-View allows for easy visualization of the different risk & opportunity segments, showing estimated time and size of potential impacts. This radar-format has been successfully applied since many years, e.g. by major insurance companies and also within the work of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Besides capturing, analyzing and visualizing, we aim for establishing a large sensory-network as well as a core-team of senior experts for running periodic (quarterly) reporting sessions.\n\n \n\nUnderlaying Business (Service) Model Canvas\n\nThe first drafts of the underlaying business model canvas has been started in MIRO, fine-tuning will be ongoing throughout the duration of Fund 6.\n\nMarket & Customer-Segments\n\nWhenever major players in e.g. industry, finance, education, healthcare or government are utilizing a public blockchain, trust in the technology as well as in the accompanying governance and risk-, lifecycle- and innovation management is key. With the services of CARDANO DLT-360 RISK Radar we are addressing and supporting\n\nRisk- and innovation-management teams within the CARDANO Community\nRisk-management teams of professional users of the public CARDANO Blockchain and tech-stack\nExpectations and demands of regulatory bodies\nThe marketing and reputation-management teams of the CARDANO Community\n\nValue Proposition\n\nWe see the following value propositions\n\nEasy, drill-down capable overview of major risks and opportunities, from the big-picture into a more detailed perspective\nWell structured capturing and reporting perspectives from different viewpoints (market, regulations, technology, security, usability, scalability, reputation etc.)\nLegal and reputation-benefits by demonstrating best-effort, applying a state-of-the-art risk assessment and risk-management framework according to ISO 31000\nAdding value to various periodic CARDANO communication formats\n\nRevenue Stream\n\nWhile Fund 6 is intended to cover the initial development of our Service-MVP and the delivery of 2 quarterly reports/reporting sessions, the future of our service will largely depend on which direction the CARDANO Community wants this to go after Fund 6:\n\nA) Exclusive quarterly service inside the CARDANO community: Can be based on a quarterly fee\n\nB) Alternative: open service format, additional subscription-based revenue from a modular service-portfolio to a wider community of customers: This could lower the quarterly fee, but might lead to loosing focus on Cardano.\n\nChannels\n\nOur value proposition will be communicated and delivered exclusively over our dedicated tools, our WEBsite and over virtual online channels (recorded or live online meetings). Participation in physical summits and meeting formats must be examined case-by-case.\n\nCustomer Relationship\n\nThis service requires a certain degree of independence, but must nevertheless be closely linked to the CARDANO Community and/or CARDANO Foundation. Depending on which of the 2 options outlined under 'Revenue Stream' is implemented, there is also the potential to establish business-intelligence and consulting-oriented relationships to clients outside the direct CARDANO community later-on (not part of this MVP-oriented Fund 6 proposal)\n\nKey-Activities & Roadmap\n\nOur current assumptions within Fund 6 are based on delivering a MVP-version of the services to the CARDANO Community. This includes:\n\nFormation of a frontend core-team of high-reputation experts\nFormation of the required backend team\nDevelopment of basic strategies, structures and processes\nImplementation of ISO 31000 compliant risk management framework \nEstablishing the basic tool environment (surveys, databases, presentation layer)\nDefining the structure of major assessment segments\nBackend work for capturing, analyzing and aggregating inputs\nEstablishing our WEBsite\nDesigning our reporting format\nDelivering 2 live examples of a quarterly report to the community\nSummary and terms & conditions for making this to a ongoing quarterly format\n\nKey-Ressources & Partners\n\nThe proposer, Heinz Gassner, has more than 30 years of experience in leadership positions within industry (https://linkedin.com/in/heinz-gassner-9540a241).

We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:\n\nWe can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other.\nLanguage and culture are not an barrier to participation.\nWe learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs.\nShow how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing.\nEnrich Cardano's ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives.\n\nThe eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE\n\nCurrent Problems and Limitation\n\nThe Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.\n\nThe Team\n\nA collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:\n\nYuta Yuta @yutazz - Japan: Cardano official ambassador, Community Co-Organiser, Catalyst Fund 2 Recipient, certified public accountant.\n\nYan Tirta @yantirta - Indonesia: Cardano Indonesia community wrangler empowering his local community with education and encouragement.\n\nMie Tran @mie.tran.0407 - Vietnam: English and International Business major with experience working with western businesses and translation.\n\nAndy Sibuea @zicozibu - Indonesia: Leading blockchain education beyond cryptocurrencies and across Indonesia.\n\nTim O'Brien @tobrien - Vietnam: No-code pioneer. Facilitator in East African Townhall (EATH).\n\nGreg Bell @grebel - Australia: IT consultant, writing Catalyst Challenges.\n\nSeomon Blub @seomon - Austria: IT consultant focused on the people-ware infrastructure for sustainable communities.\n\nRobert O'Brien @wolstaeb - New Zealand: Financial systems Software Engineer, Community Co-Organiser and Entrepreneur.\n\nStephen Whitenstall @swhitenstall - England: Tracks and documents Catalyst. Helping communities like Catalyst Circle and Catalyst Swarm organise.\n\nFelix Weber @felixweber - France: Community Manager building bridges between people. Member of the T&M Catalyst Circle/Swarm/School.\n\nThe team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall trusted seed. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm1, and Catalyst School3 and other community groups across Asia.\n\nProposed Solution: Pool of Funds\n\nTo reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture.\n\nWe are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:\n\nWe make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible.\nWe host different events where community members come together\nWe bridges to underrepresented groups\nWe integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and\nWe listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand.\n\nWe are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.\n\nDoing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.\n\nThis proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.\n\nSimply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed ondemand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals.\n\nIn return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management3 reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop4 and FWB5. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out.\n\nLearning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us.\n\nHelp us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.\n\nKPI measurement method and goals:\n\nA questionnaire on the number of proposers / voters / advisors is conducted for each **fund** in the community of the target country. The goal is to grow participation by 20% for each fund in the next 6 months. See our work on Catalyst Fund6 submission phase analysis6 as a base line example.\n\nActivities to reach KPIs\n\nDaily: Inquiries from the community about Catalyst are answered by our members in their respective languages. We will translate Catalyst content and publish it via our website.\nWeekly: We hold weekly planning events and meetups, sharing information about our activities with each community.\nMonthly: Our spending is reported. We will manage your finances in a decentralized manner using a multi-sig wallet.\nBy Fund: Surveys will be conducted in each eastern community to count the number of voters, proposers and experts in each region.\n\nBudget Areas\n\nAttendance at weekly project planning meetings that activate Eastern Hemisphere: 20 people x 2 hours x 4 weeks x 6 months x $ 15: $14,400\nFinancial management, progress management, monitoring and reporting activities, other new member recruiting activities, etc .: $ 500 x 6 months = $3,000\nCommon expenses: Expenses incurred across multiple projects (domain name, hosting costs, Zoom): $1,000\n\nTotal: (1) ＋ (2) ＋ (3): $18,400\n\n▲ Discount: $8,400\n\nBilled: $10,000\n\nFurther funding requirements in future funds will be required to maintain KPIs that support Cataslyt's success in the Eastern hemisphere\n\nWe have already started this activity and will continue to do so whether or not this funding is raised.We gave a 45.6% discount to free up funds for a wider project.\n\nNOTE: The funds directly required for each activity, such as East Asian entrepreneurial events in the Eastern Hemisphere, meetups, translation activities, theme setting and management, etc., are not in the category of funds required for this proposal.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nParticipation in our community is covered by a Contributor Covenant.

Now applying for Fund 6 to initiate the smart contract development and build a solution we can all use for real estate transactions. \n\nSo far we have established and signed a partnership with a blockchain company to process transactions and issued a \"Manager's Cheque\" in UAE including the commission share agreement and already closed one deal. New partnerships are upcoming. We have also published some content (SEO) and educate investors and worked on link-building mostly. \n\n \n\nProduct vision:\n\nMake it super easy and accessible for everyone to invest in global real estate assets with cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt is not only a buy-and-sell concept, but a full solution where you can invest in already rented out properties and collect running rents, lease out your new apartment for crypto, lend crypto for real estate developers to build new projects (equity investments and mezzanine lending). \n\n \n\nMilestones since Fund 4: \n\n1. Signed a partnership with a Blockchain company registered in Poland and UAE that is assisting with real estate transactions for Dubai real estate market (you need a business establishment with large fiat liquidity to issue so-called \"Manager's Cheque\")\n2. Closed one property sale of 354.000 USD and got a small commission in crypto\n3. In contact with a Swiss crypto broker to facilitate real estate transactions in the following currencies USD, EUR, CHF (will open more markets and contacts for the product growth)\n4. Published a few articles on how to buy real estate with crypto:\n4.1. English article - https://estati.ae/blog/buy-real-estate-with-crypto/ \nhttps://estati.ae/blog/%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bf%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8e%d1%82%d1%83/\n5. Defined initial structure of the smart contract. A few versions are available with property details and without, as well as with arbitraging options. Smart Contract development will be taken care of by ClearContracts.io (https://clearcontracts.io/) and we already discussed the next steps\n6. We can already legally process real estate transactions via the Blockchain partner company\n7. Established communication with a white-label software company for Tokenization solutions (more for the future project vision)\n\n \n\nTeam:\n\nDonatas Varnas - entrepreneur, product manager, product marketing. +5 years in product design and development primarily within recruitment and gaming industries. +2 years experience with real estate and PropTech solutions\n\nCTO / Tech Infrastructure - ex-CTO of 2 startups, helping out with the infrastructure setup, no blockchain development yet. Does not want to share his name yet.\n\nClearContracts.io - specializing in smart contract development (financial transactions) on Cardano blockchain including automation and payment releases. \n\n \n\nNext steps and the use of new funds:\n\n1. 80% of funds - Initiate a smart contract development (we are starting with a simplified version first, then build up with more property details and confirmations). Salaries for development.\n2. 20% of funds - Marketing and backlink building (SEO), need to pay for guest posts and translations. To keep the marketing momentum and get more visibility. \n\n \n\nFinancing required: 24000 USD\n\n \n\nP.S. we are realistic. This fund I see a lot of projects asking for +70k USD which is a lot of, especially when the fund should be aiming to get more projects running on Cardano and sponsor multiple entrepreneurs. We are applying for smaller amounts and would rather apply again at Fund7 or Fund8 to keep on building our product and give a chance for other projects to kick-off (instead of asking for a 200k USD). \n\n \n\nMVP build:\n\nOur smart contract development partners (ClearContracts.io) already have experience with financing and real estate transactions.\n\n \n\n1. Stage 1 - MVP will be built to facilitate wallet-to-wallet transactions for real estate, including the deposit validation (normally 5% deposit first, then full amount).\n2. Stage 2 - MVP to include arbitraging - in case of payment issues, documents, etc. \n3. Stage 3 (conditional) - smart contract to facilitate all the information about the property, location, address, land plot nr. etc.\n\nDefinition of success - have a working smart contract that can transfer funds wallet-to-wallet and contain real estate information. \n\nExpected launch date - January 1st, 2022. After Fund 6 is closed, we should have enough time to build an MVP and facilitate test transactions.\n\nMetrics:\n\nWe are now looking at multiple metrics for product development and growth:\n1. Processed transactions (closed real estate deals)\n2. Marketing performance - SEO rankings, clicks, inquiries, etc. \n\nUpcoming tech metrics:\n1. Smart contract initiations\n2. Successful Smart contract verifications/transactions\n3. Number of errors with contract execution\n\n \n\nReal-life application:\n\nIf you are a real estate investor and would like to acquire a property - we can already help with the process. So far we have only closed deals in Dubai, UAE, but other locations are also possible. For individuals and institutional investors, we can also broker apartments, buildings, or land, primarily in the UAE. Yields are 5-7% for regular 12-months contracts, but for holiday homes (short-term rentals) yields are 10-20% (normally around 15%) that can be managed by our local partners here in Dubai and paid out in fiat or crypto. \n\n \n\nMarket coverage:\n\n1. UAE - with the EU/UAE blockchain company we now cover the United Arab Emirates. We can process transactions here already.\n2. Europe and the US - haven't launched yet, but transactions and real estate contracts can be facilitated with EUR and USD currencies. Very thorough KYC/AML must be performed for investors\n\n \n\nAdditional information:\nWe are very happy to work with the community and with our users in mind.

The payment and content sending mechanism is not yet implemented, but it is possible to interact with the tale by sending transactions on the blockchain testnet.\n\nUser experience\n\nUpon accessing the site, the user can view the current tale, exploring the various branches and various illustrations. A number of actions are available:\n\nAdd a new sentence to the current story using the web interface. \nTo store the sentence on the blockchain there will be three possible ways:\n- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the sentence\n- Send a specific amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 3.5 ADA + dust) to save the sentence and obtain the unique NFT of it\n- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the sentence.\nCreate an alternate branch in the tale. \nTo store the alternative sentence on the blockchain there will be three possible ways:\n- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the sentence\n- Send a specific amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 3.5 ADA + dust) to save the sentence and obtain the unique NFT of it\n- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the sentence.\nIllustrate one of the sentences that make up the tale\nUsing the interface in the Dapp, the user can create an illustration and store it on the blockchain in two ways\n- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the illustration\n- Send a specific amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 3.5 ADA + dust) to save the illustration and obtain the unique NFT of it\nVote for a specific branch of the tale. \nTo save the vote, the user can:\n- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the vote\n- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the vote.\nVote for the end of the tale. \nTo save the vote, the user can:\n- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the vote\n- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the vote.\nPurchase the NFTs of the PDFs of the books-game tales already completed, which will include all the various branches created and all the illustrations.\nTheir number will be limited and related to the number of users involved in the creation of the specific tale.\nIt will also be possible to purchase the paper copy of the tale linked to the NFT.\n\n \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nThe development consists of three main parts:\n\nFrontend\nThis is the website used by users to view tales and interact with content.\nIt is a SPA (Single Page App) developed with the Vue.js framework that consumes data from the Dapp API.\nBackend API \nIt is the bridge element that connects the blockchain and the frontend. It parses the data from the blockchain (relying on a cardano-graphql node / Dandelion) and serves them in a specific format that can be consumed by the frontend.\nIt also takes care of recording the content sent by users and sending them to the Dapp engine for storage.\nIt is developed with the Laravel framework and hosted on a web server.\nDapp engine \nIt is the component that takes care of submitting transactions on the blockchain and minting the various NFTs.\nIt is written in JS using the cardanocli-js wrapper to interact with the cardano node.\n\nThe generated NFTs will be stored on IPFS.\n\n \n\nMarketing and product launch\n\nAfter the product's public launch a social media marketing campaign will be conducted (mainly on Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, Discord), advertising a \"promotional tale\" that will be created on purpose to highlight the potential of the product.\n\nEach sentence and illustration addition will be published on social media channels and the related NFT generated will be given away to followers.\n\n \n\nPossible Risks\n\nWhen we thought about this dApp for the first time, ADA price was not so high, so we ignored that the cost to submit any action to the dApp can be too high for the average user.\n\nIn the current design this could be a potential big limitation for the dissemination of the project among users, but unfortunately the minimum ADA per transaction it's something defined in the protocol which cannot be circumvented.\n\nIn case we encounter such a problem after development, we plan to research an alternative system, really similar to what is done by Atala Prism now.\n\nBasically, the idea is to create a \"centralized\" sidechain during the tale creation, allowing users to submit sentences and illustrations for free and using a cryptographic mechanism, confirm the integrity of all the content submitted. The Dapp engine will submit content in the blockchain in chunks, maintaining the integrity and verifiability and reducing the cost for the final user.\n\nThis solution moves away from the initial idea of ​​using the site only as a \"viewer\" for stories written on the blockchain, but it seems to us an excellent compromise between usability for users and the immutability of the stories.\n\nIn case of need this approach will be expanded and a research will be published as a deliverable.\n\n \n\nFuture development (not included in proposal)\n\nIn the future we would like to expand the basic concept of the dApp to target specific market segments, for example:\n\nEducation: adapt the dApp for kids, creating some special features for teachers to engage young students in creative writing\nComics / Manga: adapt the dApp to support comics collaborative creation\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nBranding (4 weeks)\nDesktop interface design (already completed)\nFrontend Development (already completed - needs refinements and integrations)\nBackend development (already completed - needs refinements and integrations)\nDapp engine development (4 weeks)\nOff-chain testing (2 weeks)\nTestnet deployment and testing (2 weeks)\nMainnet deployment and testing (2 weeks)\nFinal refinements and release (1 week)\n\nExpected launch date:\n\n3 months from the end of governance stage: January 2022\n\nBudget breakdown\n\nBranding: $1000 (~ 20 hours)\nDesktop interface design: $2000 (~ 40 hours)\nMobile interface design: $2000 (~ 40 hours)\nFrontend development: $2500 (~ 50 hours)\nAPI development: $1000 (~ 20 hours)\nDapp engine development: $2500 (~ 50 hours)\nVPS hosting + domain: $50/month * 12 = $600\n\nAvg hourly rate for Development and Design: 50$/hour\nTotal: $11.600\n\nKPIs\n\nGeneral KPIs\n\nNumber of sentences submitted through the dApp\nNumber of illustrations submitted through the dApp\nNumber of stories finalized / reinitialized\nNumber of NFTs minted\nNumber of transactions generated on the Cardano blockchain\n\nEstimate at 3 months from launch:\n\n~ 5 stories created\n~ 100 sentences/illustrations submitted\n~ 30 votes submitted\n~ 50 NFTs minted\n~ 500 transactions generated\n\nEstimate at 6 months from launch:\n\n~ 25 stories created\n~ 500 sentences/illustrations submitted\n~ 150 votes submitted\n~ 250 NFTs minted\n~ 2500 transactions generated\n\n \n\nDetailed proposers experience\n\nDehlic is a software agency born in Italy in 2012 by the initiative of Lucio Baglione.\nThrough the continuous research and experimentation of new technologies, frameworks and languages, it focuses its attention on the world of web and mobile applications.\nWorking in close synergy with communication and design studies (such as Macsiotti, Atto, ParcoStudio, The Clocksmiths, Alvvino, Accapiu), it has as a priority objective to grasp even the smallest details of the idea that emerged in the design phase, in order to implement in the most coherent way.\nThe strong belief that software, instead of placing only technical limitations, should be a tool for achieving the highest level of satisfaction of needs, supports its work every day.\nIn more than 9 years of activity it has made products for Max&Co, FILA, Furla, Emergency, BancaEtica, Politecnico Di Milano and many others.\nAtto is a visual design and communication studio born in Milan in 2013 through the partnership of two professional graphic designers.\nSara Bianchi and Andrea Zambardi, with the help of Irene Pinatto, design graphics, both on paper and in the digital world; draw artwork for books and catalogues; imagine identities for cultural entities and businesses; love research and are committed to self-publishing; teach at CFP Bauer, Domus Academy, NABA, Scuola Politecnica di Design; love processes, materials and techniques of printing; have a Risograph in their studio; develop workshops; draw illustrations and patterns; create typefaces; make animations; build websites.\nThey always work in close collaboration with their clients, establishing themselves as active parts of the process that begins – and takes shape – even before the design phase: they analyze the ever-changing themes and objects that are at the center of the requests; they model their visual and formal coherence to provide a value proposal to the clients; they are committed to providing design responses that offer a semantic, as well as visual, value.\nThey work with care, skill, professionalism and passion. They offer a design service that goes beyond visual communication, thanks to the professionals in constant collaboration with the studio in developing and implementing websites, writing and revising texts – from books to social media – and setting up locations designed for different purposes – from commercial display to installation.\nAbove all, they are convinced that culture generates culture.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369086-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nDisclaimer - ALL Artworks are just mood concepts and can differ little in detail from the final version -\n\nCombine blockchain technology with NFTs in a fun competitive fantasy game environment\nModular development strategy with three Phases\nPre-Sale, NFT Marketplace, Native App for Android and iOS\nQUEST is already a Stake pool!\n\nTeam\nCoding: Dirk worked for Ubisoft, founded two gaming studios as a Dev Lead, and is currently working as a Technical Architect.

We all are old-school gamers(started in the mid '80s), played a lot of pen&paper RPGs, love tabletop games, and of course strategy. This project will be something like our legacy. Ada Quest will not only be for the masses, we are developing this title because we like to play our own games. Maybe one day you will meet us on the battlefield or in a dungeon, cave, tavern you name it ;)!\nStory\nWelcome to the legendary world of ADA.\nIt is epoch 259! Long before this time, there was a huge war in ADA, which completely cast a spell over the land. It was about the most powerful gemstone, the Goguen Stone! Whoever possessed this stone would be the absolute ruler of this world. Nevertheless, in the greatest battle, the Goguen Stone shattered into four pieces.\nAfter this bloody encounter, a mage, a barbarian, a dwarf, and an elf were each able to take possession of one of these shards. In order not to devastate the land any further, the four heroes agreed to a truce and founded the first four realms.\nNow you have arrived on ADA and it is up to YOU to choose your hero and your destiny. Prove your skills and courage in duels and quests to finally conquer this world! But watch out, ´cause nothing is as it seems. An unrecognized greater threat lurks in the darkness, which wants to use this legendary world for its intrigues.\nStart your QUEST for ADA now…\n!

Since we started to develop the world of ADA, we also already invested time and money BUT we also started to create a community around our project, which we like to expanse to an international one.\nThe initial NFT sale will hopefully allow us to get some financial support from the community, which would flow completely into the development.\nThe future business model will be a hybrid of in-game sales (only cosmetics, NO pay2win) and community-based funding for upcoming add-ons and maybe some further rewards from running our stake pool successfully.\nBesides the initial NFTs sale, what really will help us to get through the phases is the additional \"juice\" to set up the business and run smoothly until the release. The first draft of the game is created by us, our coder, artist, and game designer are working already on Phase I of the project. So the requested funds for a full-blown out mobile game are just fair as far as we can see from our experience. Similar independent projects with the game mechanics we are looking for need around 500K$-1M$ budget minimum.

We have built them to help take some of the manual load off IOG staff. They take time and resources to develop and maintain and we would like the community to support their continued development.\n\nDetailed Explanation:\n\nIn the Project Catalyst process there is a phase (Quality Assurance Stage) that allows Proposers and VCAs to review the ratings and assessments done by the Community Advisors.\n\nThe assessments are evaluated using the criteria defined in the Red & Yellow card document (link here).\n\nA Community Advisor could get a \"yellow card\", which will cause the exclusion of the specific assessment, a \"red card\", which will exclude all his assessments or positive \"Constructive Feedback\", reserved for assessments that comply with the guidelines and add value to the process.\n\nHere is an overview of the process:\n\nAfter the Community Advisors submission, the proposers have some days to report the assessments that they consider unfair or out of the guidelines, adding a rationale to their report, or to highlight assessments with \"Constructive Feedback\".\nvCAs receive a master file that includes all the proposers' reports and have some day to flag assessments out of guidelines, fair, or with \"Constructive Feedback\".\nThe vCAs reports are aggregated and an algorithm is run to determine consensus on a decision for each specific assessment (at the moment 4 vCAs have to be involved in the decision and more than 50% of vCAs have to agree on a specific infringement criteria).\nYellow and Red cards are assigned to Community Advisors and invalid assessments are excluded.\n\nThis process is currently possible thanks to the implementation of the QA scripts, run by the IOG team, that create Master Files for each stage, validate inputs, calculate the consensus and produce the results used for the final ratings. It's a technical but it's very important to the current operation of the system.\n\nThe current implementation (used in Fund 5) consists in 4 scripts:\n\nCreate Proposer Document\nBased on the IdeaScale export is created a Google Sheet document with all the criteria defined in the R&Y card document. Proposers use this document to report assessments.\nBlank assessments are automatically marked.\nCreate VCA Master File\nBased on the output of the Proposer Document, a vCA Master File is created. It includes all the criteria defined in the R&Y card document and the new column \"Proposer mark\" which indicates if proposers reported specific assessments.\nThe first rule of red card assignment is executed in this script: it counts the percentage of blank assessments made by every single CA and assigns a red card if the defined threshold is reached, excluding all his assessments.\nvCAs have to make a copy of this file and review the assessments.\nThe output produced by this script is totally compatible with the vCA tool (included in Community Tools proposal funded in F5), offering to vCA a more user friendly way to interact with this process.\nCreate Similarity\nThis script compares all the assessments to each other and assigns a similarity score for each combination. The output of this file can be used by vCA to identify bad actors and copy-pasted assessments.\nCreate VCA Aggregate\nAll the single files produced by vCAs are aggregated in this script, and the consensus rule is executed for every assessment, assigning yellow and red cards to CAs.\nThis script produces the final valid assessments list that are used to calculate the final ratings.\n\nNew features that will come in Fund 5:\n\nUse the same mechanism currently used by vCAs (create a Master File, allow vCA to create a copy and submit it to IOG) will be implemented also for Proposers, avoiding working on a single shared Google sheet. This will allow the release of the qa-proposer tool, which will offer a more user-friendly way for proposers to interact with this stage.\nThis implementation will also give more control to IOG to check that proposers flag only the assessments of their own proposals.\nAdapt the scripts for the new rewarding model for CAs.\nA full update to the criteria used by vCA to classify CA reviews in Excellent / Good / Not Valid and to the consensus mechanism.\n\n \n\nPart of this proposal is an experiment in funding already implemented value add. The funds requested for this proposal will cover the current implementation (the scripts that have been in use since Fund 4) as well as be used to maintain and adapt the scripts as changes are introduced into the Catalyst QA process until the end of 2021 (Fund 7 included).\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nThe scripts are written in Python and they use Pandas Dataframe framework to interact with the original IdeaScale export (provided by IOG as CSV). They are released as open source code on Github (https://github.com/coire1/catalyst-review-of-reviews-tools).\n\nThey also interact with the Google Docs API to publish the output as Google Sheets with some styling to improve the sheet UI.\n\nExperience\n\nDeveloper with 9+ years of experience (mainly focused on web/mobile. Languages and frameworks: PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Python, Ruby - Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, Angular.js, Vue.js, Node.js).

People in these communities are excited about getting involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Despite having a population of 1.6 Billion, Catalyst has seen very few proposals from East Asia and Southeast Asian regions.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE\n\nCurrent Problems and Limitation\n\nAcross East Asia and Southeast Asian regions, English is not routinely spoken and a web of regional languages are used 1.\n\nLanguage barriers reduce participation in Catalyst. It limits the potential growth of Cardano adoption and utility in this region. We experience this, we hear this from our communities. We know Cardano is missing our stories, our energy, and our perspectives of how to use Cardano to increase economic wellbeing.\n\nTeam\n\nA collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:\n\nYuta Yuta @yutazz - Japan: Cardano official ambassador, Community Co-Organiser, Catalyst Fund 2 Recipient, certified public accountant.\n\nYan Tirta @yantirta - Indonesia: Cardano Indonesia community wrangler empowering his local community with education and encouragement.\n\nMie Tran @mie.tran.0407 - Vietnam: English and International Business major with experience working with western businesses and translation.\n\nAndy Sibuea @zicozibu - Indonesia: Leading blockchain education beyond cryptocurrencies and across Indonesia.\n\nTim O'Brien @tobrien - Vietnam: No-code pioneer. Facilitator in East African Townhall (EATH).\n\nGreg Bell @grebel - Australia: IT-consultant, writing Catalyst Challenges.\n\nSeomon Blub @seomon - Austria: IT consultant focused on the people-ware infrastructure for sustainable communities.\n\nRobert O'Brien @wolstaeb - New Zealand: Financial systems Software Engineer, Community Co-Organiser and Entrepreneur.\n\nStephen Whitenstall @swhitenstall - England: Tracks and documents Catalyst. Helping communities like Catalyst Circle and Catalyst Swarm organise.\n\nFelix Weber @felixweber - France: Community Manager building bridges between people. Member of the T&M Catalyst Circle/Swarm/School.\n\nThe team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall **trusted seed**. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. The exteded team includes professional interpreters and translators.\n\nOur Solution: Translation Pipeline and Automation\n\nOur objective is to build and document a streamlined process for content translation and start the development of localised content. We have already set up a simple translation pipeline2 using Git, Hugo, and Github Actions. We've tested several translation services such as Crowdin3, Lokalize4, PoEditor5, and GitLozalise6 for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.\n\nOur initial objective is simple: to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using a semi-automated system. Gaining experience and building community. Documenting what we do and how.\n\nBy semi-automated system, we do not mean machine translation. While Machine translation is helpful as a starting point, it has difficulty with specialised terms and does not read naturally. Human translations will always have a slight advantage. A semi-automated system refers to an ability to queue a piece of work for translation, which may include feeding it through a machine translation service, have it worked on by someone, reviewed, and then published.\n\nWe will start to embrace and extend the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group7 to help us. Adapting the processes to accommodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take. \n\nWork Streams\n\nTo establish a functioning and sustainable translation pipeline, we are seeking initial funding to help develop the work we have already started. The funding will cover five workstreams:\n\nEvaluation of translation services and their integration: with Git, Github, Ideascale, and the Markdown-based documentation efforts of the Cardano Foundation.\nDesign, configuration, testing of a translation pipeline: The goal is to have a small scale process in place that is easy enough to follow and requires minimal supervision.\nDocumenting translation process & development of tutorial material: Embrace and extend the Kubernettes SIG Doc7 processes to help with our own needs. Developing localised tutorial content to onboard future translators.\nTrain the trainers: Run training sessions with Eastern Townhall members to a level of competence in the process such that they can train others.\nTranslations: Getting up to speed on our workflow is going to require some hands-on tinkering and experience. We aim to translate a selection of Catalyst Guides, Community Advisor, voter education and our own material. That takes time and effort for each language.\n\nGetting Scale: Earn-to-Learn\n\nTo get true scale, translations and localisation standards, automation, and skills need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano and the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work; learning and earning. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages Metadata, Native Assets, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Machine-Learning, and Atala Prism on the Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach. However, starting simply first.\n\nCollaboration\n\nTranslation and localisation of content is a general issue across many groups working in Cardano and Catalyst. We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusively. In the Eastern Town Hall, we are at the forefront of managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practices and automated processes for our own purposes, and share them widely. Everything we learn and do, we hope will inform the Cardano ecosystem at large.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nNear-term the Eastern Townhall is able to translate and host Catalyst Proposals as they are finalised. Translated for our four initial languages in the Asian region. Funded project reports are integrated and translated too. We have also translated, and maintain those translations, of key Cardano and Catalyst documents and guides.\n\nMid-term we would like to expand the languages translated, and we are actively working with other groups across the Cardano Ecosystem to do this work.\n\nLonger-term success means we've established a whole decentralised workflow for translation and interpretation of any document, video, podcast etc. using the Cardano Network as the coordinating backbone. Where one of the simplest ways to onboard and earn ADA in the Cardano ecosystem system is to help translate, transcribe or interpret material (no harm in dreaming big!).\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nSince we are using Git, and Github for the Eastern Townhall planning, organisation, documentation, metrics are derived from Github activity and engagement.\n\nKey Metric: Project Velocity8, defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits and pull-requests taken from Github.\n\nActivity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence documents added and the speed of translation.\n\nCommunity Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories9 for the Eastern Townhall website, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nAfter One Month:\n\nEastern Townhall website information architecture has been developed.\nPrimary content for the initial website has been identified and ported to Markdown.\nThe entire Eastern Townhall website is translated.\n\nAfter Three Months:\n\nWe have established a semi-automated translation pipeline driven by Git Pull requests.\nEvaluated and tested different translations services as a means to simplify translation.\nDocumented our initial translation process and trained the trainers.\nExpanded formats for translations to include video subtitles.\nIssuing NFTs for skills, language, and attribution/contribution tracking.\n\nAfter Six Months:\n\nOn-boarding more members of the Cardano Community to do translations.\nAdded two more Eastern hemisphere languages to our core set.\nTutorial material (documentation and videos) is developed and translated to help onboard new contributors and languages.\n\nAfter Twelve Months:\n\nAll Catalyst Proposals and Funded Projects are translated and published within days of being produced.\nWe have expanded our core language set to include the ten languages from the Eastern hemisphere.\nThe translation project is self-sustaining because projects/teams/businesses want to reach our audience in their native language.\nThe Cardano ecosystem coalesce around similar standards for document management and their translations.\n\nLicensing\n\nAll our source code will be licensed under a free and open-source (OSI) license e.g. MIT, and contributions must be contributed patent-free.

We would like to see this community acting also as builders and active contributors. For this to happen, we need to solve two challenges:\n\nLanguage barrier: most Catalyst content is made in English, while a large part of African community speak other languages such as French, Arabic and other local languages.\nData consumption: access to the Internet and to data in general is very limited in Africa. Users need to pay for each megabyte they use, and this limits the potential consumption of Catalyst materials already being produced.\n\n \n\nThe Catalyst School: what is it all about?\n\nThe Catalyst School is a place created to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles. We onboard new members and help improving their skills along the way, in any way they decide to engage with Catalyst: as a proposer, a Community Advisor, a Veteran Community Advisor or without any specific role within the process.\n\nThis project helps the community through live sessions and workshops, 1-to-1 and group support in different languages, interactive website and other workshops related to Catalyst.\n\nAlthough, for the African community, these might not be the best ways to learn and interact with Catalyst, since most of them are led in English and require a large internet bandwidth and data consumption.\n\n \n\nOur solution: Catalyst School localized for Africa\n\nWith this proposal, we aim at including the African community into the Catalyst process as Proposers, Community Advisors and other roles they would like to take within the process.\n\nTo achieve that, we are proposing to:\n\nCreate low data learning materials (PDFs, text files, compressed images) and use them to provide all relevant information about Catalyst and how to interact and actively participate in it.\nTranslate these materials to local languages (French, Arabic and the most spoken African language).\nTeach and train African Catalyst members to run Catalyst School sessions within their communities, and also to provide 1-to-1 and group support.\n\nThe topics covered by the Catalyst School session and 1-to-1/group support are:\n\nIntroduction to Catalyst\nProposing in Catalyst\nHow to be a Community Advisor\nHow to be a Veteran Community Advisor\n\nThis proposals aims at providing these services for 2 Funds (Funds 8 and 9), according to the roadmap below.\n\n \n\nRoadmap and Milestones\n\nWhen funded in Fund 6, the content creation and training will be done during Fund 7, and it will be ready to be delivered in Funds 8 and 9, according to the following schedule:\n\n3 months after funded (end of Fund 7):\n\nLow data learning materials created and translated to local languages.\nLocal African Catalyst members chosen and trained to run Catalyst School session and provide 1-to-1 and group support.\n\n6 months after funded (end of Fund 8):\n\nLow data learning materials in 4 languages (English + 3 local languages) distributed to the African community.\n12 Catalyst School sessions ran (one of each kind per language).\n15h of 1-to-1/group support given to local communities.\n\n9 months after funded (end of Fund 9):\n\nLow data learning materials in 4 languages (English + 3 local languages) updated and re-distributed to the African community.\nFurther 12 Catalyst School sessions ran (one of each kind per language).\nFurther 15h of 1-to-1/group support given to local communities.\n\n \n\nKey Metrics\n\nNumber of School sessions attendees\nNumber of participants in the 1-to-1 and group support sessions \nNumber of new African Catalyst members\nNumber of new African Proposers\nNumber of new African Community Advisors\nNumber of new African Veteran Community Advisors\nNumber of new African Voters\nNumber of new African Referees\n\n \n\nThe Team\n\nThis proposal is being submitted as a partnership between WADA and The Catalyst School.\n\nWADA: Cardano Community skilled practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across Africa & the diaspora. Mission: Connecting West African Developers and Entrepreneurs to the Cardano Ecosystem and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).\nWebsite:\nhttps://wadalliance.org/\nThe Catalyst School: A place to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles.

Experimenting with different types of solutions will help highlight what the community values and give support to using effective solutions that drive the participation and engagement the ecosystem needs to thrive.\n\nNFTs have proved increasingly popular across the whole of the crypto market. Collectibles of NFT art pieces started a large movement in the crypto space. NFTs are effective for scarcity, being a verifiably owned asset and can be used as a potential reward or gift for someone's contributions or participation within a community.\n\nAs part of the Catalyst School we want to experiment with NFTs as rewards to determine their effectiveness to help encourage meaningful participation within Catalyst School.\n\nIf successful the Catalyst School would then look at taking this approach and applying it to Project Catalyst itself so that as a community we can increase participation and create an even more engaging experience and an increased sense of belonging within the community.\n\n \n\nObjectives\n\nIncrease involvement from students and motivate a constructive environment in the learning phases\nProvide a form of proof that a student has participated in courses / workshops\nEngage new participants using NFTs as an advertising and brand strengthening vehicle for the Catalyst School\nDetermine the effectiveness of NFTs as a reward system and whether it encourages the right behaviours and not ones that could be disruptive or distracting to the educational purpose of the Catalyst School\nDetermine people's response and preferences towards NFTs as a reward in the process of learning and participating to help provide a case study towards both Catalyst School and other projects considering a NFT rewards model\n\n \n\nInitial NFT ideas\n\nThe following are some initial NFT ideas we are considering to use within the Catalyst School:\n\n\"Attender\" NFT - Distributed free of charge to all attendees of Catalyst School live events, such as workshops in the after town hall and Swarm sessions.\n\n \n\n\"Share the Love\" NFT - Distributed to students who bring people into the school through referrals.\n\n \n\n\"Catalyst Builder\" NFT - Distributed to students who help improve the Catalyst School experience by providing feedback and suggestions about the documentation, workshops or any part of the process.\n\n \n\n \n\nOther potential NFT ideas\n\nThe following ideas are ones that require more reflection and time. We may use them alongside of or instead of some of the initial NFT ideas if we believe they may be more impactful:\n\n\"Top Learner\" NFT - Distributed to students who complete quizzes or competitions after a workshop or on the website. We are looking at where quizzes or competitions may make sense before introducing this NFT.\n\"Serial Asker\" NFT - Reserved for particularly active students (asking questions / offering new ideas and perspectives) during workshops or on the school's Discord channel. A key thought to this idea is whether the reward could drive disruptive behaviour for the sake of receiving the NFT.\n\"Perceptive Learner\" NFT - In the resources produced by the Catalyst School (documents / video / live events) there will be hidden links, unique for each resource, which can be used to obtain the related NFT. Where possible, like for the resources served by the website, these links will be randomly placed. On this idea we are still thinking how it may be implemented and also how we could prevent it being gamified.\n\nFuture scope\n\nIf the NFT ideas are successful within Catalyst School we would look at exploring the following areas to produce some NFTs as a reward. We would be looking to help Project Catalyst and helping with the following type of participation and engagement:\n\nProposers\n\nCreating quality proposals\nIncreasing collaboration and combining proposals or teams when that makes sense\n\nCommunity advisors\n\nLeave quality assessments\nComplete more assessments\n\nVoters\n\nRead proposals thoroughly and vote on what will help grow and improve the ecosystem\nDelegate their vote to an expert to help ensure votes are used well\n\nAuditability\n\nOpen source repository for any development and the process used to mint and integrate the NFTs as a reward system\nA completion report with our findings from the feedback for the reward system looking at whether it had any meaningful impact to community engagement\n\n \n\nDevelopment roadmap & milestones\n\n1 month after funded:\n\nDocument the reward process for School members to understand the reward system\nFinalize the NFT selection and process for distribution\n\n2 months after funded:\n\nProduce graphic designs for NFTs\nMint NFTs\nOpen source any development work or minting process used to create NFTs\n\n3 months after funded:\n\nIntegrate the NFT reward system in fund 7 workshops and any courses\nIssue NFTs over the the course of a future Catalyst School funding round and gather feedback to measure against KPIs\n\n \n\nKPIs\n\nPercentage of students who request to have the participant NFT after completing a workshop\nNumber of students who had heard about the NFT reward system before joining a workshop or course\nAsking students to rank the reasons they joined the Catalyst School and ensure NFTs is part of that list to determine what the key drivers were for their involvement.\nWhich NFT rewards the students were interested in receiving.\nWhat other areas in Catalyst School or Project Catalyst that students think should also receive rewards and whether they believe NFTs were a suitable solution after receiving them.\n\n \n\nBudget\n\nNFT minting and distribution - $2,000\nNFT Design - $1,500\nManagement and admin - $1,500\nTotal: $5,000\n\n \n\nThe Team\n\nWe believe that collaboration is the key for the success of Catalyst… and it couldn't be different with this project!\n\nWe are a group of 11 people of diverse backgrounds, but two common passions: Catalyst and education.\n\nGo on and get to know our team:\n\nAlejo Escrivá: Product & Growth Marketing consultor, business analytics MBA, Industrial Designer, and Entrepreneur with 8+ years shaping lovable products and communities.

The team (and our extended network) has experience in User Experience design, used formal methods, and developed high-performance systems in financial settings. Over the last thirty years, we've worked on highly concurrent distributed systems using C/C++ and functional languages OCaml, Erlang, Scala, and Haskell. We have experience in Blockchains and cryptocurrency projects.\n\nOur Solution\n\nA Bonding Curve Plutus Software Development Kit (SDK). We will design and engineer a module of baseline Smart Contracts for implementing Automated Market Makers (AMM) and more.\n\nWe will build an open-source, reusable module in Plutus utilising the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) architecture. It will be general enough for use in many applications and will be reliably incorporated into more complex Plutus designs. Layered over that will be a Software Developers Kit (SDK) to enable easy integration with DApps.\n\nBonding Curves1 are one of the most useful and widely used components in DeFi. They are used in AMMs that underpin many of the Decentralised Exchanges (DEX), Loan, and Insurance protocols popular in DeFi. Their applicability extends beyond the limited scope of DeFi, including many different scenarios for Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance, project funding, fractional ownership of NFTs etc.\n\nAn EUTXO Specific Architecture\n\nThe module and Smart Contract design will be engineered specifically for the EUTXO architecture of the Cardano Blockchain. The core design will utilise a batch auction mechanism to maximise throughput and prevent resource contention on the underlying reserve (liquidity pool). The design is based on the Treynor Dealer model13. A design that combines an order book (Dealer) as a periodic combinatorial auction with an AMM liquidity pool.\n\nThe combinatorial auction is not your typical English Auction! It is an off-chain optimising algorithm designed to maximise welfare (a fair price for all participants). A single Plutus-Backend node can execute it, or run as an Oracle Pool when more complex higher-throughput matching requirements are needed.\n\nBonding Curves can be parameterised to suit specific periodic settlement windows (per-slot, epoch, or other), throughput requirements, shared reserve pool, and transaction matching using metadata. A simple bidding language for more complex matching scenarios is envisaged; Allowing a form of token-based if-then-that logic which is particularly relevant to the composition of bonding curves.\n\nPlease refer to our Catalyst Fund 2 Proposal for more details about Combinatorial Auctions and Oracle Pools2, and our Catalyst Fund 5 proposal3 for more details on Bonding Curves and their use.\n\nTo design and build the Bonding Curve module and SDK, we are using as a reference the Comos Bond Module4; leveraging the economic and system dynamics work already done by Blockscience5, the Token Engineering6 community, and Shruti Appiah7. As the project gets underway, we will welcome other interested contributors from the community to help build and maintain the project.\n\nImpact on Challenge Metrics\n\nDApps for DeFi, SoFi (Social Finance), and RealFi can be built from these standard building blocks. Many aspects of project funding, team accounting and compensation systems are similar. There is no need to keep reinventing the same components.\n\nThe bonding-curve module aims to be an essential toolkit for software developers that don't want to dive into learning Haskell, EUTXO, PlutusTx or the Plutus Application Backend. An essential toolkit for technology start-ups that don't have the skills in complexity-science and engineering talent to develop great economic protocols.\n\nBy focusing on baseline primitives and engineering for reuse across the Cardano Ecosystem, we can make it faster to deploy reliable market-focused DApps. DApp developers can easily integrate and interoperate modular Smart Contract mechanisms that we develop, giving customers confidence that their wealth is secure and value streams are fair.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nKey Metric: Project Velocity8, defined as a combination of base activity metrics of commits pulled from Github.\nActivity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence of deliverables and engineering milestones achieved.\nCommunity Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories9 for the Bond Module, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem. These Metrics derive mostly from Github.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nOur proposal will contribute to Cardano's developer ecosystem a module of bonding curve primitives explicitly designed for the EUTXO architecture. They are intended for integration into other higher-level protocols and DApps.\n\nAfter One Month:\n\nInitial specifications and scope for bonding curve module completed.\nNix-based Jupyter notes infrastructure established integrating Nix, Python, and OCaml into a reproducible data science/simulation pipeline.\nEngagement with individuals interested in contributing to the work via a DAO.\n\nAfter Three Months:\n\nDeveloped simulations for the system dynamics of the combinatorial auction design.\nA draft formal specification and tested using Bigrapher10, a Bigraphical Reactive System (BRS) simulator.\nPre-Alpha implementation of the core protocols running on testnets.\n\nAfter Six Months:\n\nCompleted design for the module(s) and implementation of the core protocols running on testnets.\nDocumentation published that both explains the design and use of the bonding curve primitives.\nDAO trusted seed established and plans to hatch the DAO using Bonding Curves for future funding are developed. The primary purpose of the DAO is to ensure long-term, cost-effective support of the module and continued development.\n\nAfter Twelve Months:\n\nFormal specification published\nProduction-ready core protocols fully engineered, tested and audited.\nAn SDK for one development environment developed (most likely Haskell, with PAB).\nFive projects use the bonding-curve module in their implementation; A mix of DeFi, SoFi protocols, DApps, and DAO.\n\nThe project will evolve over time including the extension of bonding curves to bonding surfaces (see Balancer11) and incorporate a bidding language. We are making a commitment to ensure there is long-term support that will be managed and funded by a DAO (using bonding curves to fund and govern it!).\n\nLicensing\n\nAll our source code will be licensed under a free and open-source (OSI) license e.g. MIT, and contributions must be contributed patent-free.

These tools were created to facilitate the process to the different Catalyst roles: Proposers, Community Advisors and Veteran Community Advisors, as further explained below.\n\n \n\nCatalyst Assessment and Review Phases Overview\n\nIn the current Catalyst process, after proposals are finalized, there are three phases that make up the assess and QA processes before community voting:\n\nCommunity Advisors (CAs) assess the proposals and give them a rating between 1 and 5 in three categories: Impact, Feasibility and Auditability, along with a rationale explaining each rating given;\nProposers review the CAs assessments, when they are able to flag low quality/unfair assessments to be checked by the Veteran Community Advisors (vCAs).\nvCAs review assessments of proposals, using those flagged by the Proposers in the previous phase as a potential starting point.\n\n \n\nPrevious problems that the Community Tools are helping to solve\n\nPreviously, during the assessment phase, CAs had to navigate through IdeaScale website and search for proposals to access. In order to better distribute the assessments between proposals, CAs had to manually search for the least assessed proposals, which was inefficient, tiring and time consuming. During Fund4, to assist with this task, a document was created by IOG indicating the proposals that were missing a minimum number of CA reviews.\n\nThe assessments' review done by both Proposers and vCAs was performed using an Excel sheet, which was functional to perform the job, but in the case of vCAs reviews, there was no coordination during this phase. This led to an imbalance in the reviews of assessments: some assessments receive lots of reviews, and others receive none.\n\nAs seen in Fund4, CAs and vCAs got overloaded with the amount of proposals they needed to assess and assessments to review. Considering the expected exponential increase in Cardano Project Catalyst's size, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of CAs and vCAs work over time.\n\n \n\nOur solution: AIM Community Tools\n\nTo solve these problems, the AIM team has developed three tools:\n\nA CA Tool, to automatically suggest a proposal to be assessed by the CA based and his challenge preference and the least assessed proposals. Link: https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool/#/\nA Proposer Tool, to make it easier to go through all the assessments, set them as 'checked' and/or flag them. Under development.\nA vCA Tool, to automatically suggest an assessment to be reviewed by the vCA based on his filter choices and the least reviewed assessments. Link: https://cardanocataly.st/vca-tool/#/\n\nThese tools aim to make the process of assessment and review easier, and also to improve/create coordination between CAs and vCAs during these phases.\n\nThe CA and vCA Tools were already developed and used in Funds 4 and 5, and received very positive feedback from the CAs and vCAs, who mentioned that the tools improved their productivity and made the whole process a lot less tiring.\n\nSince the CAs and vCAs work is paid by Project Catalyst as well, we believe these tools are already increasing the Return on Intention related to these activities.\n\n \n\nThis proposal's goal\n\nThe development of the AIM Community Tools was already funded in Fund 5 ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350981-48088 ). Although, Catalyst is an ever evolving experiment and these tools will need to be updated probably every Fund in order to keep them relevant and bringing value to the process.\n\nAs an example, during Fund 6, the IOG Research team presented a new rewarding scheme for CA's assessments, which changed the way that vCAs reviewed these assessments. These changes need to be included in the Community Tools, otherwise they will become outdated and cannot be used anymore.\n\nTherefore, this proposal is a request for funding for updating and maintaining the Community Tools for two more Funds (6 and 7).\n\n \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nThe current version of the tools, developed for Fund 5, are three Vue.js SPA (Single Page Application).\n\nCA Tool: the app will be updated with the new data for F6 and F7. The mechanism to keep track of the assessed proposal will be improved with a self-checklist for the CA that will include some guiding questions to help him to better prepare high quality assessments.\n\nProposer Tool: the initial version developed for Fund 5, was based on the R&Y Card system and all the data structure of the tool included all the criteria mentioned in the document.\n\nIn Fund 6, the new system includes different criteria (excellent/good/not valid), and the data structure will be updated according to it.\n\nvCA Tool: the initial version developed for Fund 5, was based on the R&Y Card system and all the data structure of the tool included all the criteria mentioned in the document.\n\nIn Fund 6, the new system includes different criteria (excellent/good/not valid), and the data structure will be updated according to it.\n\nRoadmap\n\nCA tool - F6 data entry (~ 9th Sep 2021)\nCA tool - Guiding question improvements (~ 9th Sep 2021)\nProposer review Tool - Release (~ 17th Sep 2021)\nvCA tool - Updates (~23rd Sep 2021)\nCA tool - F7 data entry (prior to assess stage in F7)\nProposer review Tool - Release (prior to assess QA stage in F7)\nvCA tool - Updates (prior to assess QA stage in F7)\n\n \n\nBudget Breakdown\n\nCA tool - F6 data entry ~2 hours\nCA tool - F6 new features development / Static links and resources update + testing ~4 hours\nProposer review tool - F6 updates + testing ~8 hours\nvCA tool - F6 updates + testing ~8 hours\nManagement - F6 Meetings, planning ~10 hours\nCA tool - F7 data entry ~2 hours\nCA tool - F7 updates + testing ~4 hours\nProposer review tool - F7 updates + testing ~8 hours\nvCA tool - F7 updates + testing ~8 hours\nManagement - F7 Meetings, planning ~10 hours\n\nTotal hours: 64\n\nCost per hour: 50$\n\nTotal: $3200","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368917-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe Shared Reality platform is here to upgrade our information ecosystem. This proposal will help get the most reliable information into the system as quickly as possible, so that the public can live in a shared reality around such important topics as: Was the 2020 US presidential election stolen? Was there evidence of obstruction and collusion in the Mueller Report? Does Donald Trump suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder? Were we all lied into the Iraq War and, if so, was that a crime? Was 9/11 an inside job? Are we currently bring brought through the process of Active Measures and towards Civil War in the United States? Are vaccines and autism related? Etc, etc...\n\n \n\nDisinformation can only survive because of two defects in our information ecosystem:\n\n \n\nThe public cannot ask questions and get meaningful answers. Because of that, large groups of people can never become satisfied with the prevailing narratives they have been brought to distrust (and which may, after all, be untrue). Right now, the conversation between the media and the people is strictly one-way. Joe Arpaio said, \"You ain't gonna see any damage control\" to counter his false claims about Obama's birth certificate. And, there have not been any. In 2019, 56% of Republicans polled believed that Obama was not born in Hawaii. This is a threat to our republic, and to our lives. In a society where we all know that we're being lied to and we just can't get on the same page about who it is, the existing information infrastructure isn't nearly good enough.\n\n \n\nWhen the public wants to know about a topic, it doesn't hear from specialists directly. It hears from pundits and media conglomerates. This is inefficient, costly, and dangerous. Enough with the dynamic of being presented with competing narratives - for decades! The public wants to know what 97% of climate scientists believe. The public should have the ability to raise the funds necessary to find them, vet them, and ask them - in detail - what they believe about each idea around the issue of climate change.\n\n \n\nThat's what the Shared Reality platform is all about. One key step in fulfilling our mission of bringing the best information to the public is: incentivizing specialists to providing that information.\n\n \n\nThis proposal is meant to raise the funds needed to design and create a token on Cardano. Then, that token will be used to reward specialists (and others) for submitting information to the Shared Reality platform. This will build documents of unparalleled neutrality and completeness on any controversial topic.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368921-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368963-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nAs the Cardano ecosystem grows, loosely formed global teams are emerging. These teams will form treasuries that need to be managed and leveraged in a trustless and scalable way. We are already seeing this within the Catalyst ecosystem where collaboration is championed. Catalyst Swarm, Catalyst School, and the Eastern Townhall are examples of this. These teams are inspired to solve vexing problems that are either technical in nature or address real-world problems or both. It is however a challenge to fund innovative public good production.\n\nCatalyst's Grant funding model will not scale well. Funding innovation and science are notoriously difficult. Outcomes are difficult to measure, are uncertain, and don't have market prices to help guide investment. As Project Catalyst grows it will become more difficult to directly manage the influx of proposals and funded projects. Grant programmes and direct democracy do not scale globally.\n\nEnabling rich and fast experimentation with emergent teams and treasuries- Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)- will enable Cardano to innovate rapidly. We need to build reusable components to let that experimentation happen. \n\nTeam & Experience\n\nThe team has experience in financial markets software engineering, cryptocurrency payments, tech start-ups, Data & Govtech, impact investing. We are also active in organising a legal-tech community and the Eastern Townhall.\n\nRobert O'Brien: Distributed Systems Software Engineer (Financial Systems) and Entrepreneur. Co-Founded three start-ups in Financial Data Analytics, International Trade Payments, and Impact Investing. Co-organises LegalHackers New Zealand, and advises a Social Entrepreneurship Incubator. Co-Initiator of the Eastern Town Hall.\n\nAndrew Walker: Distributed Systems Software Engineer, mostly in the financial sector in the City of London. Worked at Barclays Capital (credit risk) and LIFFE (derivatives exchange). Working on cryptocurrency payments infrastructure and also experienced with the hospitality sector.\n\nWe are Plutus Pioneers (Cohort 1). The team (and our extended network) has experience in User Experience design, used formal methods, and developed high-performance systems in financial settings. Over the last thirty years, we've worked on highly concurrent distributed systems using C/C++ and functional languages OCaml, Erlang, Scala, and Haskell. We have experience in Blockchains and cryptocurrency projects.  \n\nOur Solution\n\nRisk-Adjusted Bonding Plutus Software Development Kit (SDK). We will design and engineer a module of baseline Smart Contracts for implementing Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curves.\n\nWe will design and engineer a reusable Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curve(RABC) 1612 module and SDK. An open-source reusable module in Plutus utilising the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) architecture. Robust and general enough to be used across many applications; Reliably incorporated into DApps and Treasury Management processes. There will be no need to keep reinventing the same components.\n\nLayered over the module will be a Software Developers Kit (SDK) to enable easy integration with DApps used in DAOs. A System Dynamics modelling toolkit, using cadCAD2, will help project teams decide on configurations and set parameters for their contract deployments.\n\nAn RABC6 implements a type of Impact Bond3. A performance-oriented investment instrument suitable for retroactive project funding. Funding projects with highly uncertain outcomes when they succeed. Leveraging treasury funds by only paying out when results are achieved. RABC have been researched and developed as impact finance instruments12, yet the design is applicable to new or innovative project scenarios: social or environmental change, science, early-stage and seed-stage technology start-ups, internal corporate project budgeting, DAO coordination, leveraged community grants, art, and public good production.\n\nVitalk Buterin recently gave a talk4 about the future of Etherum that focused heavily on the problems addressed by the RABC mechanism. The mechanism design and economic system dynamics have been extensively researched for the retroactive funding use case. The work is presented by Blockscience10 as a dynamic technical report containing executable simulation. See: https://github.com/BlockScience/Risk-Adjusted-Bonding-Curves\n\nA EUTXO Specific Architecture\n\nThe module and Smart Contract design will be engineered specifically for the EUTXO architecture of the Cardano Blockchain. The core design will utilise a batch auction mechanism to maximise transaction throughput and prevent resource contention on the underlying reserves (liquidity pools). The design is based on the Treynor Dealer model7. A design that combines an order book (Dealer) as a periodic combinatorial auction with an AMM liquidity pool, scaling transaction throughput.\n\nThe combinatorial auction is not your typical English Auction! It is an off-chain optimising algorithm designed to maximise welfare (a fair price for all participants). A single Plutus-Backend node can execute it, or run as an *Oracle Pool* when more complex higher-throughput matching requirements are needed.\n\nThe underlying bonding curves, and therefore the composite RABC, can be parameterised to suit specific periodic settlement windows (per-slot, epoch, or other) and throughput requirements. In addition to curve specific parameters, the RABC can be configured with different Alpha parameter sources including a signal source from an Oracle, or via a prediction market.\n\nPlease refer to our Catalyst Fund 2 Proposal for more details about Combinatorial Auctions and Oracle Pools7, and our Catalyst Fund 5 proposal8 and the economic specification6 of RABCs for more details on them, their composite, and their use.\n\nTo design and build the Risk-Adjusted bonding curve module we are using, as a reference, the Comos Bond Module5; Heavily leveraging the economic specification6 and system dynamics work already done by Shruti Appiah111 & Blockscience10. As the project gets underway we will welcome other interested contributors from the community to help build and maintain the project.\n\nImpact on Challenge Metrics\n\nDApps for DeFi, SoFi (Social and Environment Finance), and RealFi can be built from standard building blocks. Many aspects of project funding, team accounting and compensation systems are similar. There is no need to keep reinventing the same components.\n\nThe RABC module aims to be an essential toolkit for software developers that don't want to dive into learning Haskell, EUTXO, PlutusTx or the Plutus Application Backend. An essential toolkit for technology start-ups that don't have the skills in complexity-science and engineering talent to develop great economic protocols.\n\nBy focusing on primitives and engineering for reuse across the Cardano Ecosystem, we can make it faster to deploy reliable market-focused DApps. DApp developers can easily integrate and interoperate modular Smart Contract mechanisms that we develop, giving customers confidence that their wealth is secure and value streams are fair.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nKey Metric: Project Velocity8, defined as a combination of base activity metrics of commits pulled from Github.\n\nActivity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence of deliverables and engineering milestones achieved.\n\nCommunity Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories9 for the Bond Module, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem. These Metrics derive mostly from Github.\n\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\nOur proposal will contribute to Cardano's developer ecosystem a module for Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curve explicitly designed for the EUTXO architecture using Plutus. The module is intended for integration into other higher-level protocols and DApps.\n\nAfter One Month:\n\nInitial specifications and scope for RABC module completed.\nNix-based Jupyter notes infrastructure established integrating Nix, Python, and OCaml into a reproducible data science/simulation pipeline.\nEngagement with individuals interested in contributing to the work via a DAO.\n\nAfter Three Months:\n\nDeveloped simulations for the system dynamics of the combinatorial auction design.\nA draft formal specification and tested using Bigrapher15, a Bigraphical Reactive System (BRS) simulator.\nPre-Alpha implementation of the core protocol running on testnets.\n\nAfter Six Months:\n\nCompleted design for the module and implementation of the core protocols running on testnets.\nDocumentation published that both explains the design and use of the RABC.\nDAO trusted seed established and plans to hatch the DAO for future funding are developed.

Recently, web app support was added (see this projects live demo wallet: https://flutter-cardano-wallet.web.app/)) and Flutter will soon support desktop apps. Other Flutter strengths are fast, fluid, pixel-perfect user interfaces, rapid prototyping, excellent developer tooling and a modern, user-friendly, strongly-typed programming language.\n\nFund 5 Recap\n\nThe Fund 5 work established Dart, the programming language of Flutter, to be a first class development environment for writing Cardano clients. Unlike many other Cardano software development kits (SDKs), the Flutter Wallet SDK is written in pure Dart which guarantees this complex cryptographic code will work seamlessly on all of Flutter's supported platforms: iOS, Android, web and desktop. The Fund 5 work targeted a few critical use-cases, but was, by design a proof-of-concept prototype, leaving out such key features as native tokens, NFTs, staking and smart contracts.\n\nFund 6 Overview\n\nA Fund 6 grant would result in a full-featured Cardano SDK for the Flutter developer community, along with the educational resources to fast-track onboarding. The budget covers 500 hours of full-time development over the next four months in three broad areas:\n\nFinish SDK (410 hours) - Deliver a complete, professional, high-level SDK. As detailed below under SDK Task Breakdown, there is much work to be accomplished, but the highlight will be smart contract support. Clear documentation and use-case examples will be emphasized, along with good test coverage to ensure high-quality, high-reliability code.\nPublish Tutorials (80 hours) - An important component in on-boarding developers is the availability of high-quality tutorials. This would entail writing and publishing Flutter demonstration apps, writing step-by-step tutorial articles around each app and, time allowing, video tutorials. Likely topics would include: loading and displaying wallet balances, building and sending a transactions, minting native tokens or NFTs and connecting to and running smart contracts.\nCommunity Support (10 hours) - Answering questions, sharing coding insights, explaining design decisions and responding to feature requests can be time consuming, but is important for community building.\n\nSDK Task Breakdown (410 hours)\n\nThe primary project directive remains to produce a high-level SDK that enables developers to focus on their business idea and not the low-level details of the Cardano blockchain.\n\nAreas of focus will be:\n\nSmart contracts (100 hours). - This will focus on basic handling, verification and signing of smart contracts. At least two common use-cases will be provided as hand-written samples. Lastly, tooling for off-chain code generation will be explored.\nPersistence (40 hours) - The majority of professional applications require a persistence layer to provide good user experiences. This built-in persistence module will allow restoration of wallet state (even when off-line), faster updating when on-line and possible API extensions. Time allowing, non-blockchain data storage like NTF image caching and saving wallet metadata, will be implemented.\nNative Token/NFT (25 hours) - Provide minting and burning support for Native Tokens and NFTs.\nStaking (25 hours) - Provide stake pool ranking and stake delegation support.\nMithril Ready (30 hours) - With the Mithril project, IOHK is laying the groundwork for lightweight Cardano clients to have first-class, blockchain access without the overhead of running a full node. To future-proof this SDK, its architecture will be generalized to adapt to any blockchain communication technology, including Blockfrost, GraphQL, Ogmios and inevitably Mithril.\nSecure storage (20 hours) - Provide a cross-platform, encrypted storage solution for private keys and passwords.\nMulti-signature Support (20 hours) - Support multi-party signatures on scripts and contracts.\nAlternate Addresses (20 hours) - Support Enterprise and Pointer addresses, in addition to legacy Daedalus, Yori and other address schemes.\nHardware wallets (20 hours) - Design private key signing architecture to allow delegation to hardware wallets and support at least one popular real-world wallet.\nDApp Linking (20 hours) - Chrome browser extension version to allow wallet-DApp communication, hopefully by leveraging the fruits of the Fund 5 Cardano Connector (Metamask-like) project.\nAPI clean-up (20 hours) - Designing good APIs is hard. In addition to refactoring for clarity, this task would standardize the model and service interface patterns, as well as, reduce third-party dependencies.\nUse-case examples (20 hours) - Document common use-cases with clear, concise code examples.\nTest coverage (20 hours) - Plug holes in test coverage.\nMisc. Coding (10 hours) - Clean-up some Fund 5 technical debt like making sure lovelace is stored using BigInt types and separating the integration and unit tests.\nCode audit (10 hours) - Identify know crypto exploits and rectify. Explore security review options.\nUser-requested Features (10 hours) - Reserve some time for adding features requested by users.\n\nDeliverables\n\nCardano Wallet SDK - https://pub.dev/packages/cardano_wallet_sdk  - Building on Fund 5 proof-of-concept foundation, a complete Cardano client SDK will be the primary deliverable of Fund 6.\nBlockFrost API - https://pub.dev/packages/blockfrost  - This Fund 5 artifact will be updated as needed to support Alonzo features.\nTutorials - Demo apps will be published on GitHub.com, written tutorials on medium.com and video tutorials on YouTube.com.\nDemo Wallet - https://flutter-cardano-wallet.web.app -  This live demo app will be updated as time allows to demonstrate the SDK in action. This is a closed-source project and development time will not be billed to this Catalyst F6 project.\n\nWho is this guy?\n\nWatch the Fund5 interview if your curious about my background and would like more insight into this project:  https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/fund/f5/challenge/25939/proposals/352623 \n\nRoadmap and Performance\n\nFund 5 work will be completed before the Fund 6 start date: 11/1/2021. Code will be continually pushed to GitHub and the corresponding pub.dev package repository throughout the duration of the project. Catalyst Fund 6 work should be completed four months after the start date. Future work will be driven by community interest and developer adaption.\n\nInternally, performance will be measured by passing unit tests for the promised features. Externally, the primary performance indicator (KPI) will be adoption as indicated by the popularity percentage on pub.dev. For any of the timelines (3, 6 and 12 months), anything over 10% indicates significant usage. At publication date, F5 blockfrost is already at 46% and the F5 cardano_wallet_sdk is at 26%, incredible for a half-finished project. I expect these numbers to spike once the tutorials roll out.\n\nBudget\n\nI felt very honored to be funded in F5, but underestimated the development time by a factor of 4. Attempting to be more realistic in Fund 6, I'm requesting 500 hours and a $30,000 budget (full breakdown is in the write-up above). This will provide a living wage, while I work full-time on the SDK over the next four months. To reduce costs and keep ROI high, I've lowered my rate from $100/hour to $60/hour.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368970-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe voter-tool (https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/) was developed as an experiment in pre-funding development by three active Community Advisors: Lucio, Victor and Phil.\n\nAfter developing the Community Tools for Fund 5, a set of tools aimed at CAs, vCAs and Proposers to facilitate the Assess / QA process (successfully funded in the same fund), we focused on something that could facilitate and improve the voting experience in Catalyst beyond Ideas Scale and the official Voter App.\n\nDuring the previous funds the need emerged for the voters to have a more user-friendly interface to explore the various proposals in a given fund in a user friendly way.

Within it, people from all over Latin America and the Hispanic world are getting together to collaborate on many initiatives. Some at the regional level, others -like this one- with worldwide potential.\n\nThere is a wealth of information that already exists within the Hispanic Community of Cardano. Writers, promoters and early adopters are actively creating this content. We have brought them together in a standardized way and leveraged the information and expertise in order to create the initial set of articles for the wiki, in Spanish. Now, we would like to continue with the development of the Portuguese side of our Wiki; so we can onboard Brazil, a key player in the Latin American ecosystem.\n\nAll these coordinated efforts will serve as a launching platform to become the biggest Cardano Wiki, not just in Spanish or Portuguese but for all languages.\n\nTo build any respectable repository of information takes time. To make it properly and multi-language, takes even more time. But not when we're working as a community to make it happen for the benefit of all.\n\nThe intent is not only to share relevant articles and topics, but also to grow the community and foster collaboration. We encourage writers and content creators from around the world to bring on their own projects and grow their reputation at the same time.\n\n \n\nHow will ALDEA achieve this?\n\nA phased approach is only natural, when the most important metric to measure growth is the number of active members, driven by the up-to-date, relevant articles and documents.\n\nOur Phase 0 Wiki or MVP consists of a working engine, with a given number of articles, members and roles, to serve as a pilot for the project. This has already been achieved and it's available at https://aldeawiki.org\n\nPhase 1 (Fund5) aims to both grow the number of articles and gain traction within the Spanish Community by promoting awareness and spreading the word. This will help bring more writers and content creators forward, making the number of articles and collaboration to grow exponentially. The first phase of our Wiki has already been funded in Fund5: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/ALDEA-Wiki-Cardano-Encyclopedia/352436-48088\n\nPhase 2 (Fund6) will bring ALDEA Wiki to the worldwide stage with focus on the creation of Portuguese content and promoting awareness across the whole Cardano Community.\n\nPhase 3 (Fund7) and subsequent phases will keep on adding languages, organically building the number of articles and promoting awareness and adoption around the globe and the many different community hubs within the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\n \n\nBUDGET\n\nSimilar to Phase 1, Phase 2 will take 8 weeks.\n\nWe are asking funds ONLY for ALDEA Wiki | Phase 2 - Portuguese.\n\n \n\nContent Creation / Incentives for the Community -> USD 1500  \nWiki Configuration: 60 hours -> USD 1200\nProfile Management / Security / Administration: 50 hours -> USD 1000\nMarketing & Promotion: USD 1200\nHosting Infrastructure for 1 year: USD 720\nTOTAL: USD 5620.-\n\n \n\nBUDGET DETAILS\n\n \n\nContent Creation / Incentives for the Community\n\nWe have plans to actively reach out to the Portuguese-speaking community and encourage them to participate in the Wiki, by generating the first relevant content and articles. To gain more traction on the first weeks of the development, we would like to professionalise this task and not only count on volunteers.\n\n \n\nThis is the list of the main topics that will be covered by the articles of our Wiki (starter kit):\n\n \n\nBlockchain + Blocks + Transactions + Consensus + Consensus Attacks + Hashrate\nCryptography + Cryptocurrency\nWallets + Nodes + Keys + Addresses + Token\nExchanges + CEX + DEX + P2P\nWallets + Nodes + Keys + Addresses\nMainnet + Testnet + Forks\nWhitepaper + Roadmap + MVP\nBitcoin + BTC + Lightning Network\nProof of Work + Mining\nSatoshi Nakamoto + Vitalik Buterin + Charles Hoskinson\nUTXO + eUTXO\nEthereum + ETH + ERC-20 + Gas Fees + EVM\nSmart Contracts\nSolidity + Vyper\nDAO + Governance\nDecentralisation + dApps + DeFi\nProtocols + Layers + Oracles\nCardano + ADA\nProof of Stake + Stake Pool + Staking + Delegation\nProject Catalyst + Funds + Roles + Cohort + TownHalls + Catalyst Voting App\nPlutus + Marlowe + Haskell\nCardano Foundation\nIOHK + Papers\nEmurgo\nYoroi + Daedalus + Otros\nOuroboros\nByron + Shelley + Goguen (Mary + Allegra + Alonzo) + Basho + Voltaire\nPoolTool + Adafolio + ADAPools + Pool.pm + ADAStat\nALDEA + ALDEA Wiki + ALDEA Catalyst\nCardano Components + cardano-node + cardano-CLI\nKEVM / IELE\nAdrestia\nHydra\nAtala PRISM\n\n \n\nWiki Configuration\n\nAt the moment, ALDEA Wiki only supports content in Spanish. We would like to convert it to a multi-language platform during this Phase, starting with Portuguese.\n\n \n\nProfile Management / Security / Administration\n\nWe need to allocate a few hours for maintenance and general housekeeping of the platform to assure a good quality of the service.\n\n \n\nMarketing & Promotion\n\nWe would like to work together with Cardano YouTubers & Influencers and Marketing Specialists to promote the Wiki.\n\n \n\nHosting Infrastructure\n\nWe need USD 65 monthly to pay for our dedicated t2.medium AWS instance. We have already asked for USD 60 on Phase 1.\n\n \n\nKPIs\n\nWe will measure the growth of ALDEA Wiki using the followings metrics:\n\nNumber of relevant articles\nNumber of active members (visitors, content creators, reviewers, translators)\nNumber of languages in which the articles are available\nNumber of countries using the platform\n\n \n\nChecklist\n\nHow my proposal impacts the challenge metrics\n\nThe main metrics of the challenge we impact with this proposal are:\n\n- Number of non-English speakers joining Cardano community: we will measure this by the number of users who join our Wiki. All of them are going to be non-English speakers since the platform only supports Spanish (at the moment), and will support Portuguese with the developments stated in this proposal.\n\n- A sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk with: we already have this! And we would like to keep growing our community both in Discord (https://discord.aldea-dao.org) and in Telegram (https://t.me/elFogonDeALDEA).\n\nDefinition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months\n\nThis is explained in greater detail in the 'How will ALDEA achieve this?' section above.\n\nWithin the 3 months time frame, Phase 1 will be completed and the team will already be working on Phase 2, which will take place between the 3 to 6 months time frame.\n\nFor the 6 to 12 months time frame, we'll be working on Phase 3 where the community will already be organically building up the number of articles and promoting awareness on a global scale within the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\n \n\nDefined expected public launch date.\n\nThe Phase 2 MVP will be live by September 30th in preparation for Fund6 Governance Phase. In this MVP we would like to show the first Portuguese articles, so the community has a sense of what is going to be to have a multi-language support for our Wiki.\n\n \n\nHow I address the challenge question?\n\nHow can we motivate non english speakers to learn and grow Cardano ecosystem in the next 3-6 months?: Phase 2 of ALDEA Wiki aims to motivate non-English speakers (in this case Portuguese speakers) to produce content. By doing this, everyone using our platform is learning about key concepts from our ecosystem, and an educated community is the bedrock for future grow of Cardano.\n\n \n\nOur Team\n\nWith 70+ years of combined IT experience in software development and digital transformation across a variety of industries, our core team of 6 people includes Technical Leads, Business Analysts, Product Wizards, UX Designers, Entrepreneurs, Business Owners, and Foreing Trade and Banking Analysts.\n\nThis combined experience brings all sorts of skills and knowledge to the table. These include technical and business-oriented skills, but above all, it brings creative thinking, problem-solving, resiliency, experience in working for global and diverse teams remotely among different languages and cultures, reporting to stakeholders, and the ability to do all this while having fun!\n\nWe are lucky to already have the support of several Stake Pool Operators from the region, senior Cardano enthusiasts and key members of our community, acting in an advisory and promoter capacity, with whom we meet regularly and are already essential members of ALDEA.\n\n \n\nThis proposal is backed by ALDEA (the Latin America DAO - https://aldea-dao.org)) and its Community.\n\n \n\nLinkedIn Profiles of our Core Team\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/matias-falcone/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-canavessio/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mauro-hernan-falcone/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/eramallo/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-lanfranchi/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-falcone-682726109/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368922-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368928-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nHe who forgets his past is lost\n\n(African Proverb)\n\n \n\nAfrican Culture\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, African culture dates back hundreds of thousands of years.  At one point in history, Africa thrived and was considered to be the center of the world economically, culturally and in many other measures.  \n\nThere are many African stories and cultural impressions that have survived the test of time.  Moreover, there are new and compelling cultural stories being created across Africa and the African diaspora everyday.  African Cultural NFTs will capture the ancestral story as well as the modern day story in illustrations, story, and other expressions of African cultural story.\n\n \n\nThis is a Wada treasury project.  A percentage of the proceeds that result from the sale and resale of NFTs will be used to fortify the Wada treasury as a liquidity provider.  \n\nWada Treasury\n\nInfrastructure projects\nEducation initiative\nOther Wada priorities\n\nArtist(s) will retain 0% - 85% from sale of the NFT (Artist incentives for funding the treasury).\n\nWada treasury will receive 15% - 100% of the sale (perpetual) of the NFTs through the Wada network.\n\n \n\nIllustrations and Story\n\nArtists will create illustrations that represent specific characteristics of African ethnic groups / tribes both on and off the African continent.  In some cases the illustrations will be accompanied by story.

We suggest that you read it first, as on top of being dictionary of terms used throughout the proposal, information about those terms that you might not be aware of (e.g. did you know that money can be thought of as energy when modelling financial markets)?\n\n \n\nLiquidity - ease of exchanging one asset for the other without affecting the asset price, at the perceived current market value. Naturally the most liquid asset is fiat currency, for instance USD can be exchanged for many assets around the world, it is used in international settlements, and the payments performed by individual organisations, regardless how large do not affect the price of USD.\n\n \n\nModel - mathematical description / definition of system, e.g. liquidity model defining how liquidity pool models market dynamics in the response to trades. However, even a poor model can be used for the purpose of modelling, but it will suffer from many inefficiencies (lagging behind the actual state, being too sensitive / having too high inertia, etc.). All CFMM AMM are poor liquidity models (see below for definition of AMM and CFMM).\n\n \n\nAMM - automated market maker; a liquidity definition as a supply formula enabling automatic (autonomous - without the presence of maker) trades, preserving certain properties such as path independence (the execution price is not depending on the history of transactions), and for trading without any active interaction from the maker party (makers provide assets into the liquidity pool which are then managed based on pool model / formula).\n\n \n\nCFMM (constant-function market maker) - AMM model using constant function; the most famous example is Uniswap v1/v2 model of x * y = const.\n\n \n\nMaker - party providing liquidity to the market (pool); i.e. making the market (making it possible for trades to execute).\n\n \n\nTaker - party exchanging on the market (e.g. swapping token X for Y).\n\n \n\nQuantitative Finance - scientific field using mathematical and statistical modelling for the purpose of investment management. Quant finance enables modelling of complex stochastic (random processes) and building efficient models and accurate predictions. Quant finance is used heavily in traditional finance in modelling markets, managing risk, making both automated and manual investment decisions, to name a few.\n\n \n\nDEX (decentralised exchange) - non-custodial exchange executing trades on-chain.\n\n \n\nTradFi - traditional finance.\n\n \n\nAccount Model - a model used by ETH and a lot of other smart contract blockchains, where the global state is shared, and all operations are applied sequentially, one after the other based on tips, giving the rise of front-running, and other exploits or MEV.\n\n \n\nFront-Running - refers to using the knowledge of submitted orders, to tip the exchange / protocol, with the aim to insert your order (based on existing information) ahead of other orders, in order to capitalise on this knowledge. For instance, spot a whale swap, tip the protocol to insert transactions before in the block, buy at the cheaper price, allow the whale order to move the market (whale pays more for the order), tip for 2nd order to be placed after the whale order, sell immediately for higher price.\n\n \n\nEUTxO Model - accounting model used by Cardano where all assets are stored in EUTxOs (boxes) that can be spent either using private key (e.g. wallet transactions) and (Plutus) script (private key and script are locked on the box). The wallet balance is the sum of all EUTxOs that the wallet can spend. In the EUTxO model each EUTxO has to be spent when used, hence can be only used once per block (20s).\n\n \n\nConcurrency \"Issue\" - a consequence of applying account based models to EUTxO model putting the entire pool liquidity into one EUTxO leading to either requiring an off-chain sequencer to build transaction blocks (but at the cost of centralisation) or to being able to perform only one transaction per block (as each EUTxO can be only spent once per block and to be used each EUTxO must be spent). \"Issue\" is quoted, since this is a design fallacy rather than the EUTxO model issue, which simply requires a different approach, and to architect concurrency into the protocol itself.\n\n \n\nArbitrage - exploiting the market inefficiency between trading venues (exchanges); in the most simple case of the arbitrage, let's say ADA is priced at $3 at exchange A and at $2.95 at exchange B. The arbitrage bot will find this information and will attempt to buy ADA at exchange B for $2.95 and sell it immediately at exchange A at $0.05 profit per ADA. The act of arbitraging moves the price, as after the execution, the price at the exchange B will be higher (e.g. $2.98) due to purchasing the discounted ADA, and on exchange A it will be cheaper due to selling it (e.g. $2.98). As long as there is a price difference between exchanges, so that when these trades are executed they are more profitable than the execution cost, arbitrage is possible. Arbitrage leads to all exchanges being arbitrage converging on the central limit value (true market sentiment from the aggregated exchanges) of the asset price. The arbitrageur earns profits by buying at discount from exchange B and selling at the premium at exchange A, hence both exchange B sellers and exchange A are the source of income for the arbitrage bot, and are \"victim\" of the market inefficiency (in reality they are not victims, but simply prone to be scalped this way). Finally, the mentioned example is the most basic case of arbitrage (pure arbitrage), there are multitude of arbitrage styles, including statistical, where arbitrage is based on the market movement predictions and the average expectation of reward https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage#Types . Arbitrage leads to efficient price discovery, but at the cost of market participants (both takers and makers).\n\n \n\nSlippage - difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. In the AMM model, slippage occurs due to not large enough liquidity compared to the amount of assets being swapped.\n\n \n\nMoney≡ Energy - when modelling financial systems you can think of money as a unit of energy, same as in physics, we can think of kinetic, potential, and other energies, energy is potential to perform a certain amount of work. We can think of money in the same way, money has potential to be applied in the market from lending to businesses developing novel ideas, increasing market efficiency by providing liquidity to exchanges, creating information flow via arbitrage and financial analysis and research, to utilising available information to maximise returns given a specified risk appetite. However, energy can be applied in many ways, if we choose a very inefficient way to do something (e.g. growing tomatoes in a completely dark underground bunker we will expend a lot of energy) when we can put it in a greenhouse or even on a balcony and make much more energy efficient use. Same in the capital markets, efficient models lead to high money utility (energy well spent towards productive work), and productive work is the work that usually is associated with the rewards (e.g. business borrowing money will pay it with interest). Therefore, an efficiently allocated liquidity will work very well even with low total value locked and respond quickly to the changing market dynamics, bringing higher rewards per unit of capital.\n\n \n\nCapital Efficiency - each task has many ways of being performed, one way will consume more resources (energy, time, etc.) than the other, hence the way which consumes less resources and achieves the same result is more efficient. The more efficient use of capital the better generated returns, the better user experience, and the better reflected the actual state of the market.\n\n \n\nEfficient Market Hypothesis (Market Efficiency) - a hypothesis stating that the prices in the market reflect all the information available. In practice it is rarely true, a straightforward example is Dogecoin raise to top 10 and firmly remaining there based on a series of Tweet without without anything behind them, and even rebuttal from the Dogecoin development team itself, and market ignoring this information, and irrationally valuating Dogecoin at the higher price. This definitely does not reflect the fundamental information available in the market, and is an extreme case of market inefficiency. In traditional finance, such an overvalued company would be shorted and the research would be published showing its shortcomings, and people would evaluate validity of the study. If an asset would be severely undervalued, a leverage or long options would be bought magnifying significantly the potential returns from the efficient use of information. Under the Efficient Market Hypothesis, an asset would be priced at what they truly are worth and there would be very little difference in the asset prices between exchanges. However, to the contrary, market inefficiency is such a commonly occurring phenomenon that there is a whole field of study dedicated to measuring it and adjusting trading strategies based on it, but most of the time the inefficiencies take root from lack of information flow between exchanges (e.g. via arbitrage) and irrational decision making (modelled well by behavioural investing). But, this is not a problem without solution, it is merely the result of the environment emerging from inefficiencies of the exchanges and irrationality of the actors in the market.\n\n \n\nImpermanent Loss - loss of capital when compared to HODLing due to inherent flaws of liquidity pool formula. The worst offenders are ironically the most popular family of constant-product pools such as Uniswap's v1/v2 x * y = const. It occurs when providing a pair of assets into a liquidity pool, as the rations of x and y change in the pool and the more the prices diverge, the bigger the impermanent loss. At some point, around the 20-50% threshold (the range is large due to inherent typical crypto volatility), actually holding the 2 separate assets outside of the pool would have been a better investment. It is even made worse by incentivisation by yield farming to create the most negatively correlated pools there are possible (completely deflationary crypto such as ADA and completely inflationary fiat such as USD). Those two assets will naturally diverge and create the impermanent loss, in a sense out of the gecko the deposited funds have a sizeable hole in the bucket through which the total value of the funds you deposited leaks. ... it is even made worse by many DEXes being either only concerned with increasing the amount of transactions (in order to obtain more fees from transactions) to being completely oblivious to this obvious mathematical fact (DEXes are generally built without regard to quantitative modelling). \n\n \n\n \n\nProblem & Solution\n\nAll established liquidity models, including those being currently developed by DEXes on Cardano, do not model markets well (see model, market efficiency, and impermanent loss in the glossary for more info) leading to low capital efficiency (expenditure of large amount of energy compared to the total value locked) and have inherent scaling limit due to global memory (akin to Ethereum accounting model) architecture.\n\n \n\nWhat are the roots of the capital efficiency challenge?\n\n \n\n1. Minting sound liquidity pools.\n\nChallenge:\n\nIt is very important for the market maker to pick assets to put into a liquidity pool that, given the pool model, will minimise any potential losses while maximising the exposure to money marketing opportunities. Hence, one wants a pair that is frequently exchanged, but at the same one that is able to maintain its inherent value over time, a property that emerges from the specific assets in the pool and the model of liquidity that the pool uses.\n\n \n\nIn the majority of cases, simple CFMMs such as x * y = const and naive creation of negatively correlated pairs deteriorates the total pool value. The worst offenders are stablecoin in pair with cryptos. Stablecoins are by nature inflationary and crypto is in its nature deflationary. This means that the liquidity pool from day one is a bucket with a hole at the bottom through which your total rewards (rewards from providing liquidity and liquidity locked in the pool) deteriorate or in good case maintain current value (but then what is the point of providing liquidity).\n\n \n\nThe naive trend following on Cardano has now multitude of DEXes focusing on stablecoins and related liquidity pairs, while the only valuable role of stablecoin is to bridge traditional finance in which we live every day with the world of crypto. Once the bridge is crossed there is very little reason to do anything with the fiat, maybe perhaps except in rare conditions of very soundly designed stablecoins such as Djed which compensates swap of floatable for stable, but in the case of Djed it makes only sense to collateralise Djed with ADA, not to create liquidity pool of Djed fiat and crypto. \n\n \n\nSolution:\n\nProvide observation and orientation using on-chain and external data, to provide telemetry when creating or seeding a pool that helps to visualise the capital efficiency and the risks involved (e.g. automatically alert if the pair reserves are negatively or weakly correlated). This way market makers will be able to make much more sound decisions. What is more, we plan to reward the most sounded liquidity nodes with platform tokens (to further incentivize sound decision making).\n\n \n\n2. Capital efficient pool models.\n\nChallenge:\n\nCurrently, the most predominant liquidity pool models such as CFMM and among them x * y = const are extremely capital inefficient.\n\nIn x * y = const and other CFMMs, liquidity is provided equally across the entire liquidity space defined by all (x, y) on the supply curve. This means that there's the same amount of energy reserved for the liquidity to be provided in the least likely scenario (e.g. ADA going to 0 and USD to infinity) as in the most likely scenario (i..e the current trading price). This is incredibly wasteful, and what is worse leads to an unnatural market model.\n\nAll prices, given the space is continuous enough, are naturally of geometric nature. Continuous means lack of sudden jumps from one price to another, in practice all markets are jumpy, but to be considered continuous under this definition the jumps have to be small relative to each other (an example of non-continuous markets are exotics such as NFTs).\n\nWhat does it mean for the price to be geometric? It means that it follows the Wiener process (1-dimensional GBM - Generalised Brownian Motion):\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process ,\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion .\n\nThe reason for all prices to be geometric in nature is the relationship between ratios and logarithm, and ratios being how we express dynamic systems (in relation to itself).\n\nUnfortunately, majority of market making formulas have a constant form such as x * y = const or similar, leading to incredible inefficiency in the pool price discovery process. Given, you can model any process iteratively with the worst model, given a step is small enough, it will eventually converge, but in practice it gives rise to such issues as\n\n- slippage - the execution moving the price significantly leading in overpaying for the transaction;\n\n- inertia - pool unable to update its price due to the astronomic size of total value locked having single trades with very little effect on the price expressed by the pool,\n\n- unnecessary expenditure of energy - a lot of energy is wasted where it is not needed (impossible scenarios) and much longer process to converge on the actual price. Yes, arbitrage bots fulfil here a role of price balancer between exchanges, but there is significant lack of arbitrage between any different assets than BTC and ETH. People who exchange cryptocurrency constantly are for sure aware of sometimes gross discrepancies between prices for such liquid assets as for instance Cardano on different exchanges.\n\n \n\nSolution:\n\nPerform study of cryptocurrency asset types and families of quantitative models to express the automated liquidity. Provide a rich family of quantitative models for minting liquidity pools with information on what is the ideal pool in a given case and its parameterization. Allow for dynamic on-chain update of the liquidity pool parameters.\n\n \n\n3. Liquidity fragmentation and concurrency.\n\nChallenge:\n\nThe recent concurrency \"issue\" controversy only further proved that the majority of blockchain devs think of liquidity pools in very simplistic terms. It is easiest to design a pool with global memory, but then in the case of EUTxO account model it leads to 1 transaction per block (20s), or in case of optimisation running into memory issues (16kB per transaction and 65kB per block).\n\n \n\nSolution:\n\nAll this issue, while actually EUTxO if utilised correctly leads to a series of very desirable naturally emerging properties. If one shifts from a monolithic blocks of liquidity to fragmented nodes reflecting separate market making decisions, that naturally leads to emergence of geometric pricing models.\n\nUniswap v3, by introduction of concentrated liquidity and indexes observed the same. People specify liquidity in the ranges they think are good market making ranges and provide liquidity only within this range. As result, from all concentrated liquidity a geometric pricing model emerges.\n\nIt is a natural consequence of aggregation of multiple samples each allowing for individual expression of market sentiment. It is due to CTL (Central Limit Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem ) which states that given a large enough set of random samples, a normal distribution naturally emerges.\n\nTherefore, by fragmenting the liquidity into separate nodes all kinds of geometric distributions naturally emerge giving very efficient and market reflective pricing and liquidity models.\n\nWhen combined with Maladex liquidity scripting language, it allows for expression of all kinds of market sentiments, and hence for an emergence of true market distribution. Maker orders in the liquidity pool express their belief of the market, and given a large enough sample it starts to naturally reflect the entire real market belief.\n\nHence, not only is there no concurrency issue, if we deal with this extremely complex routing and graph order formation, but it leads to some very desirable properties.\n\nConcurrency still needs to be built into the system, but this is a routing algorithm for block EUTxO graphs.\n\n \n\n4. Efficient price discovery via arbitrage.\n\nChallenge:\n\nInformation about the makers and takers of asset prices is spread across multiple exchanges. This leads to such gross discrepancies as the 3rd largest crypto (by the market cap) having even sometimes 10-20 cents difference between exchanges. This gets only more extreme for smaller cap coins, as while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and to a lesser extent Cardano are actively arbitraged, the smaller caps are deemed not worthy of running arbitrage and hustle.\n\nThis creates a segmented markets between exchanges and lack of information flow. Arbitrage is a useful and necessary information exchange mechanism, and leads to efficient price discovery and convergence to the same price +/- delta delays on participating exchanges.\n\n \n\nSolution:\n\nOn exchange A one asset might cost $3.00, while on exchange B $2.96. This obviously is a pure arbitrage opportunity - we can buy asset on the exchange B at the discounted price of $2.96 and sell it immediately on exchange A for the premium of $0.04 per unit (for the price $3.00 each).\n\nAfter such arbitrage operation the assets on both exchanges A and B will now cost $2.98 and there won't be any more arbitrage opportunity, until the prices between exchanges diverge again.\n\nThis is not only lucrative to perform such arbitrage, but also leads to increased market efficiency - information from across all different exchanges is exchanged between exchanges leading to establishment of one geometric centric price (in the above example $2.98);\n\nIn the EUTxO and script validation mechanism model such arbitrage can be incorporated into a liquidity protocol, which we plan on doing. It will put market makers in the role of performing additional transactions (and earning additional fees), for takers it will provide market efficient price on Maladex reflecting the true market price at given time, and for the other applications it will provide invaluable on-chain price Oracle not approximating the true price, but having on-chain arbitrage proof of it. Such on-chain price Oracle does not have any lag meaning it is much more efficient than any other on-chain price Oracles (it is the optimal state), only subject to lack of liquidity not allowing for convergence of price in the market.\n\n \n\n5. Expressiveness of liquidity protocol - Maladex scripting language.\n\nChallenge:\n\nAll exchanges, even the most sophisticated centralised ones, offer a very limited number of order types.\n\nFor DEXes, usually only either CFMM AMM akin to x * y = const or limit orders.\n\nCFMM AMM has disadvantage of all the introduced market inefficiencies, while limit orders on DEXes often leads to trading pairs without limit orders to execute against, or exploitation of the phenomena by creation of spoof orders (small order to execute at the good market price and significantly off one inserted upon the small order consumption to catch anyone executing using market price orders).\n\nThis limited number of ways to express makers' and takers' intentions and beliefs in the market leads to 2 things:\n\n- a lot of manual work and monitoring to the market conditions, in case of some professional traders, even setting multiple alarms at night to check the market conditions;\n\n- inability to express dynamic conditions such as, when the price starts to rise quickly, buy back, when the price starts dropping, quickly sell, create limit order, execute limit order not at once, but in a range over time, perform simple market order, provide liquidity of given parameterization, etc.\n\n \n\nSolution:\n\nDesign Maladex own order scripting language allowing to express complex market sentiments and to allow for contract composition. This is akin to the idea described by Simon Peyton Jones et al. in https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/simon-peyton-jones/contracts.pdf . Using this scripting language, define the most commonly used order types (market, limit, liquidity pool, etc.), and allow for access to the scripting language.\n\n \n\nFounder\n\nJarek - the founder and lead developer of Maladex experience:\n\n- Master of Informatics from the University of Edinburgh (where Phil Wadler and Aggelos Kiayias research and teach) with specialisation in concurrent and distributed systems, functional programming, and formal methods.\n\n- Quantitative Finance master equivalent degree from CQF (the bespoke industry degree).\n\n- Head of Platforms in an international bank leading 3 teams, architecting and building complex financial systems.\n\n- Citadel Securities (the #1 market market in the world) where I worked on designing and building a novel approach to market making.\n\n- Microsoft Research where I worked on designing and implementation of highly scalable (cluster) machine learning algorithms used in Microsoft Office and Windows analytics (processing exabytes of data).\n\n- Experienced Haskell developer, used Haskell multiple times in both personal and commercial applications, active participant of Haskell conferences and hackathons.\n\n- Completed Plutus Pioneer program 1st cohort and got NFT to prove it.\n\n \n\nI believe that my experience gives me the unique ability to combine all 3 intersections - advanced mathematical financial modelling, building scalable concurrent protocols which EUTxO requires, and many years of coding experience.\n\n \n\nAbout Us\n\nWe operate stake pool (ticker MAL):\n\n- https://pooltool.io/pool/261789e4d39000aa333495d4dbe850708a7fe7a996011a6be98060db/ ,\n\n- https://adapools.org/pool/261789e4d39000aa333495d4dbe850708a7fe7a996011a6be98060db .\n\n \n\nWe are engaged in the community promoting Cardano, answering questions (of all types, not only related to our project, including how to implement concurrency in EUTxO).\n\n \n\nFunding\n\nTotal: $50,000\n\n \n\nThis project should receive significantly more founding due to its complexity and everything involved in delivering it, but we are conscious of other more popular projects applying in the same category (dcSpark, Minswap, and Indigo), and from experience in fund 5, we know that it is foremost popularity contest, hence we tapped down the amount to be able to receive the funding, if we made the list 4th (after those 3 projects).\n\nThis is a minimal funding possible to perform this work and we might need to apply in the future for additional funding (from audit to expanding any of the outlined concepts further).\n\n \n\nBreakdown:\n\n- 320 hours research and quantitative modelling of AAMM protocol, publication write up\n\n- 320 engineering hours implementation and testing\n\n- 80 engineering hours front-end design\n\n \n\nAverage price per hour $70 incl.

However, thus far we did not take any of those offers as one of the goals of our project is economic decentralisation (fair and wide distribution of the tokens in the community).\n\nThus far I have spent akin to $20-25k on the project development. To be clear, this is money I am never getting back as I do not receive any tokens, etc. allocation for it, we have got only fixed supply of tokens for the team (20%) which will be vested over the many years that project is being build. This means that I have got a lot of skin in the game, and the reasons I am working on this projects, which are the ideals I believe in.\n\n \n\nFeatures\n\nWe have got a unique and refreshing approach to DeFi.\n\nFor full description check our site: https://maladex.com/#features .\n\nBut, to outline our approach in the case of AAMM protocol:\n\n- capital efficiency - we make the best use of all funds locked, your funds are generating more revenue, and as the taker you find better prices.\n\n- risk control - we build risk control mechanisms into the protocol.\n\n- research and new frontiers - we push the frontier of the entire DeFi ecosystem forward, and we do it on Cardano.\n\n- powerful tokenomics - we have got one token for all our projects, and check how much we work on at https://maladex.com/#roadmap , and we not only have fair launch, we plan on distributing the token to the wide community to engage everything in the protocol and its decentralisation via the shared ownership.\n\n- one of a kind team - people with experience akin to our are not interested in DeFi because their day to day job pay exceedingly well and they are surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the industry, we however base our decisions on the goals of decentralisation and wide access to means of increasing financial wealth (hence financial revolution), we put our hearts into the project because we want DeFi as the concept to be successful and Cardano as a blockchain, and we build the future in which we want to live ourselves.\n\n \n\nDefinition of Success\n\n1 month: collect on-chain telemetry, categorise financial assets, apply stochastic modelling, design fragmented liquidity model, write draft white paper\n\n3 months: publish AAMM research paper, implement the protocol in Plutus and Haskell, testnet evaluation, stress and performance testing\n\n6 months: launch AAMM swap protocol.\n\n12 months: establish a new industry standard of market making proving the superiority of EUTxO model and pushing DeFi ecosystem and how we think about designing DeFi protocols to a next level.\n\n \n\nYou can read more about our project roadmap that goes beyond AAMM on our site: https://maladex.com/#roadmap.\n\n \n\nExpected launch date: Q4 2021 / Q1 2022.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368774-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPlease read my gitbook: https://ancientkraken.gitbook.io/fund6-proposal/\n\n \n\nA lot of focus is on the Plutus smart contracts but the reality is a majority of smart contracts are simple enough to be written in Marlowe.

Only it is not an active device. It can not be altered through environmental changes. It has no batteries. It is not useful for the perpetrator if stolen. There is no seed phrase. It only has purpose for the owner of it—the physical human being—and it fits within their cultural system of reference. It is not meaningless to those who created and possess it. It is not designed to be disposable. It is like a fossil. Over time, its meaning persists\n\nIf blockchain transactions are immutable, (have an indelible persistence):\n\nAn Object, such as a Passive Interface becomes a parallel trace of immutable history.\n\n \n\nThe Reader\n\nThe Passive Interface is paired with a unique DNA validation method, which is the Reader of the information stored within it. .\n\nThese two components, work together, to validate a user, and then provide access to the blockchain, in remote or rural areas, where there may be little or no internet service. It is not intended to replace biometric identifier solutions, but merely to offer an alternative solution as the user-base of Cardano expands.\n\n \n\nThe Passive Interface/DNA validation pair provides a safe and secure DID which minimizes the exploitation of online biometric ID validation schemes which can be used for other surveillance interests and violation of privacy. This is of great concern to indigenous communities and is becoming an increasing concern for the broader population. These online biometric methods are often seen as prohibitive when considering engaging on blockchain.\n\n \n\nResearch Opportunity: Moving away from the Screen-based interface\n\nThis research and development opportunity provides a basis for empirical studies, to consider what we may gain by shifting our focus away from legacy screen-based models of interface. And it opens the door to explore recent scientific discoveries in material science and mathematics which provide new insights for connecting our physical being to data, without storing it in a manner which creates unintended opportunities for surveillance or the invasion of privacy by centralized authorities.\n\nIt emerged through the practice of an open laboratory concept, which is an exchange of ideas, and open thinking which build upon discovery from multiple human beings, spanning multiple disciplines, engaging in synchronistic exchanges.More on this in the white paper.\n\n \n\nHow I am addressing the challenge question?\n\nThe challenge states that a proposal can include DID solutions other than the Atala PRISM biometric-based solution. My solution presents an alternative, and could not be understood fully without being considered within the context of the Atala PRISM or other biometric DID solutions. I carefully read the language of the challenge. And chose carefully when placing it here.\n\n \n\nConsidering the language of the Challenge:\n\nBegin quote from challenge:\n\nPropose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem (preferably Atala PRISM when released). This can include any method that will offer users or entities a decentralized ID to start defining their digital self-sovereignty.\n\n(Note from proposer: using preferably rather than must use leaves it open for proposers to include any method, as stated in the last sentence above)\n\nWhile we prefer to support Atala PRISM's instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.\n\nNote from proposer: again the use of prefer but clearly not requiring the use of Atala PRISM, and explicitly stating this is about building ideas and concepts that draw users to the Cardano platform.\n\nMy proposal would help many communities—who are not familiar with the language of screen-based interface, who may intentionally not have smart phones or screen-based devices, or access to the internet— a means to access the Cardano platform with little to no cost. It allows for different cultures and ancestral histories to be supported without forcing them to learn a screen-based language which may go against their ancestral or cultural beliefs. And hopefully we who are fluent in this language can learn from testing this type of engagement.\n\nAnd as mentioned above, it alleviates concerns for the exploitation of online biometric DID validation, which may be exploited for unnecessary surveillance and intrusion of privacy.\n\nEnd quote from challenge\n\nBio of Proposer:\n\nhttps://nfold.net/contact-and-about/\n\n \n\nAdditional References on Research:\n\nThis biosensor research, inspired by a 160 year old theory of light, may be useful for this Passive Interface/DNA Reader application. https://phys.org/news/2019-09-eminent-scientist-year-old-theories-aid.html\n\n \n\n3, 6, 12 Month Benchmarks\n\n \n\n3 month Benchmarks:\n\nDevelop team\n\nHire developer to assist  with  programming Passive Interface Reader.\n\n \n\nPartner with material scientist to explore biosensor development which may be useful for these devices. As mentioned in article below.

This is not only for respect, this will also drive mass understanding of the industry and thereby facilitating mass adoption & use of cryptocurrencies & blockchain based services.\n\nBy building our own organisation we can participate in the projects of other organisations on an equal footing.\n\nWe should create our own global organisation targeting all of the common objectives of United Nations Development Program, World Bank Group and others, totally funded and managed with cryptocurrency. Then we will have the attention and cooperation of these entities together with mass adoption of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.\n\nOur organisation would benefit from becoming a fully decentralised autonomus organisation (DAO), ensuring that the activities deal with real lifestyle problems articulated in plain language by the people it effects, using digital industry governance and voting models promoted by Cardano in this Catalyst experiment we will eliminate politics and bureaucracy. Our governance model should be agile & responsive, able to take action quickly and make corrective adjustments as necessary.\n\n \n\nI would like to introduce you to iHEAR Trust \"Using CryptoCurrency to Solve the Planet's Problems\" A Not-for-Profit Company. iHEAR Trust was incorporated as a registered UK Non-Profit Company in 2018.\n\niHEAR Stands for - INTERNATIONAL - HOUSING - ECOLOGY - AFFORDABLE - RECYCLING\n\nWhy International?\n\nIn order to make effective improvements we must use joined-up-thinking. We must also re-balance the differentials between developed and developing countries in terms of access to technology, information, investment, housing and sanitation.\n\nWhy Housing?\n\nThe biggest negative effects human beings have on this planet revolve around where and how we live. Dealing with our poor recycling efforts, the throw-away society, old styles of construction amongst many other issues will have a positive impact on all aspects of our climate and ecosystem.\n\nWhy Ecology?\n\nOperating purely for financial gain would be a big mistake and missed opportunity. Using our housing as a focus to reduce our negative impact on the planet is a natural and efficient way to address concerns about the deterioration we have created to the land, seas and sky.\n\nWhy Affordable?\n\nMost corporations are run with one objective in mind: ever growing profits for the shareholders. Add this to the well-established fact that there is a worldwide shortage of appropriate living accommodation, it can be no surprise that the cost of housing has risen far more than the increase in household incomes. We will work to use profits, created in the developed world, to subsidise projects in the developing worlds and find innovative methods of reducing costs or introducing new affordable financing models.\n\nWhy Recycling?\n\nThere is value in our rubbish, much of it can be reprocessed & reused, even landfills can be emptied to create energy & useable materials.\n\nIt has been established there are more precious metals available in our electronic equipment than is feasibly left to mine below ground, except for a small number of organisations there is little effort to recover and reuse these rare assets.\n\nWhy CryptoCurrencies?\n\nWe will achieve our objectives by using the power of cryptocurrencies, asset tokenisation, blockchain ledgers, smart contracts, and decentralised applications. Because this will facilitate our operations with borderless financing, an international network of people, interested in our objectives, who can supply the necessary skills to bring our mission and vision to fruition.\n\nYou can Download our White Paper Below\n\nWhy Cardano?\n\nWe see the international vision of IOG & Cardano perfectly in line with our own ambitions, we believe we will benefit greatly from the way the Cardano Blockchain has been built & developed and how this 3rd generation ecosystem will facilitate interoperability with existing dApps and the new ones to come.\n\nAbout Us, Team & Team Building\n\nSince 2018, when iHEAR Trust Limited was incorporated, all of the funding, research & development of this project has been funded by and developed by me through my primary business, Carl Henry Global https://CarlHenryGlobal.com.\n\nIt is now time to build a brand-new team that will focus specifically on developing iHEAR Trust, this will include executive directors, committee leaders and members of the sub-committees that will run the projects around the world.\n\niHEAR Trust is born out of my 40 plus years (Since 1978) in business drawing from several of the businesses I have operated including Finance, Real Estate, Internet (since 1998), Corporate structures, Lifestyle businesses and all types of marketing.\n\nCarl Henry Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhenry/\n\nIf you are interested in joining the iHEAR Trust team, offer help, propose projects or ask questions send an email to contact@iHEARtrust.org or through one of our social media channels.\n\n \n\niHEAR Trust - Projects\n\nWho is iHEAR Trust for?\n\nSimply, everyone and everything living on our planet earth. Our work will be guided though our focus on housing, ecology, affordability & Recycling. Our aim is to help \"join-up\" the thinking around the world so efforts are more co-ordinated.\n\n \n\niHEAR Trust - International Projects & Activities\n\nWhat iHEAR Trust will do?\n\niHEAR Trust, a non-profit organisation will raise funding by launching a Cardano Native Token called \"iHEAR\" as soon as decentralised exchanges are created on the Cardano Blockchain (12th September?). It will be the first global non-governmental organisation entirely funded by cryptocurrency and all operations will be run on the Cardano Blockchain.\n\nOur Token Listing: https://cardanoassets.com/bf0175e3c926ef30dd3d60ed4d374f89c1feb37b6116875f5aaf3df8\n\nWe will use the value created, by selling our token, to deepen our research, reach formal relationships with partners & innovators, build our multi-lingual international team, become an incubator for new technologies and projects that will help our planet, improve living standards internationally, support new projects, developing open-source techniques, and supplying financial & manpower resources.\n\nHere are specific examples of projects and activities we will focus on initially:\n\niHEAR Trust - Housing Projects\n\nAdd or improve Sanitation systems.\nImprove & manage availability of clean water.\nIncorporating Clean power into new & existing housing.\nDesign smart homes with Internet connectivity for all.\nImproving Live/Work accommodation for the poorest.\nUse offsite modular construction to fill the housing shortages.\nUse offsite modular construction to make housing affordable.\nDevelop a standardised ISO modular construction system.\nCreate a fund to support Rent to Buy/Rent to Own housing.\nBuild homeless & refugee shelters.\nReplace substandard slums, shanty towns and favela.\nFind & create new sustainable building materials.\nCreate building materials from existing waste.\n\niHEAR Trust - Ecology Projects\n\nLand - Re-forestation & green walls.\nLand - de-desertification & green walls.\nLand - Reducing river pollution & filtration systems.\nLand - Protecting animals & their habitats.\nLand - Urban Greening & vertical gardens.\nSky - Reducing industrial pollution.\nSky - Improving urban air quality.\nSeas - Collecting plastics & other waste.\nSeas - Protecting marine habitats & species.\nSeas - Creating Fresh water.\n\niHEAR Trust - Affordability Projects\n\nBuild a team of accountants to track global financial data.\nBuild a team of accountants to run tokenomics & maximise treasury value.\nUse the Cardano Blockchain & smart contracts to reduce cost & improve efficiency.\nCreate profits in developed countries with housing & environmental projects.\nSubsidise housing & projects in developing countries.\nHelp people to own their home using Rent to Buy/Own contracts.\nReduce supply chain costs of Building & Construction Materials.\nReduce building materials costs with alternative materials.\nReduce cost of computers, smart phones & electronics by recycling.\n\niHEAR Trust - Recycling Projects\n\nUrban Mining - High temperature processing of waste in existing landfills\neMining - Recovery of precious metals & elements in old electronic equipment.\nReuse- Refurbishing of used electronic equipment to resell or donate.\nPlasma Factories - creating plasma rock from rubbish to be used for building.\nAutomated machinery - Developing new waste sorting and recycling processes.\nGarbage patches - Developing new techniques to recover sea waste & reuse.\nWasted energy recovery - Develop new techniques to recover energy from waste.\n\nWe will be welcoming project proposals that need funding and other support to help solve the key planetary problems.\n\n \n\nUnited Nations Development Programme & World Bank Group Activities\n\nThe two organisations mentioned in this challenge are the United Nations Development Programme and World Bank Group, I have studied their activities in order to align our efforts & also to fill any gaps that exist. Both organisations welcome co-operation & involvement of other organisations in their projects. Here are my general findings on their primary activities:\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme - https://www.undp.org/\n\nEnding poverty & Improving Health\nHelping people fulfill their potential & prosper\nReverse degradation of the planet\nManage natural resources & climate change\nPromote peace & reduce violence\nDevelop global Partnerships to achieve the mission\nCreating access to financial services.\n\nNB: There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals but the list above is where the focus is currently.\n\nWorld Bank Group - https://www.worldbank.org/\n\nEnding poverty & promoting prosperity\nSustainable living practices\nAgriculture research & support\nEducation for all ages & both sexes\nRenewable & non-renewable energy research\nFinancial sector projects & study\nHousing, manufacturing, tourism & trade projects\nInformation & communications services\nRoad, rail, air & water Transportation\nWater, sanitation & waste management projects\n\nThe Conclusion?\n\nThe Cryptocurrency and Blockchain industry must show it is not just, playing \"money games\", we should show that we are fulfilling a Global leadership role, in things people care about and we can build an international non-profit & non-governmental organisation.\n\nWe can show how an organisation build for the benefit of people can be governed by the people who speak ordinary language and talk about properly identified problems to solve. The sustainable development goals of the United Nations do cover the ground necessary but are mere statements of the obvious, if you try to read the detail you will see it has been written by bureaucrats using complicated language that seems to aim to please the reader rather than identify core daily problems to solve.\n\nThank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCarl Henry\n\n \n\nRoadmap - to date (Completed)\n\nIncorporation of Not-for-Profit Company: July 2018.\nRegistered details: https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11488430\nBuilding website & social media.\nExtensive research into housng, ecology, affordable & Recycling.\niHEAR Token created on Cardano Assets:\n\nhttps://cardanoassets.com/bf0175e3c926ef30dd3d60ed4d374f89c1feb37b6116875f5aaf3df8\nSubmitted insights & Proposals to Cardano IdeaScale.\n\n \n\nRoadmap Overview - 3 Months (Requesting part funding for this phase)\n\nLaunch the iHEAR Cardano Token on a Cardano DEX (Decentralised Exchange), finalise tokenisation, build token liquidity and Market capitalisation.

Allowing anyone to create, verify and link identities to digital assets, such as works of art with the artists.\n\nThe development started as a cross-desktop wallet2, with the imminent arrival of smart contracts the project evolved towards the creation of a wallet to be used from the browser to facilitate interaction with websites.\n\nIn this way, the wallet improves the user experience, gains versatility and, besides being able to mine NFTs, we can add new capabilities by adapting to the advances and new functionalities brought by the Alonzo era and future ones.\n\nFrom Minter to Modular Wallet\n\nThus, we decided to go a step further and expand the vision and capabilities of the wallet, adapting the initial proposal to a modular wallet, where, starting from a basic wallet functionality with a friendly extension user experience, we will establish new functionalities such as support for switching between different networks, the possibility of choosing your trusted endpoints, and being able to add specific use cases in the form of addons, being the 'C64 Minter' the first to be included.\n\nMerging funds\n\nThe funds from the fund5 earmarked for the implementation of the wallet will be used in this proposal for the implementation of the more general-purpose wallet(reducing costs on this proposal). The remaining is being used to develop the main objective of the fund5 proposal, the NFTs Minter use case. More details are provided in the \"Use of Funds'' section.\n\nIn this way, we expand the fund5 proposal while still covering all the goals proposed in it.\n\nAdoption:\n\nThe light wallet type, the user-friendly 'popup' format, and the quick installation will make it easy for users to adopt it.\n\nThe capacity to easily add new use cases/plugins and the ability to customize endpoints will attract more experienced users.\n\nThe testnet support and dapps connector integration will appeal for developers.\n\n \n\nphase 0 / 2 months - Base Wallet & Web development:\n\nA.

How many books have you read and forgotten everything about content, key-messages and interesting quotes? ACADEMY is aiming to become your personal lifelong learning partner, assisting you in the initial learning-process, managing your provable merits, partnering with established players AND helping you to keep the treasure-box with all your skills and knowledge easily accessible and alive. For a quick overview, please find our functional overview graphic on our WEB-landing-page: \n\nhttps://www.academy-suite.com/\n\nImpact / Return of Intention: ACADEMY was initially drafted as conventional application-suite. Being aware that digital ID (DID), tokenomics and data privacy are key foundations for building something really new for attracting a large number of private and institutional participants, the proposers have submitted this proposal to Fund 6 and the Atala Prism Challenge Setting. By showing that this foundation works, new users and substantial attention/value can be brought to Cardano (find more details below).\nFeasibility and likelihood to succeed: The proposing team combines diversity, a strong background in learning-methods and innovation with senior industry-leadership experience. Our distributed locations in Brussels, São Paolo and Malta help us also with access to key-resources and to important educational institutions and public authorities (find more details below).\nAuditability: In spite of the grand vision, the deliverables for Fund 6 are carefully set according to the motto: dream big - start small. Besides creating a usable MVP for first basic functionalities, we want to proof that the Cardano technology-stack is providing us with a rock-solid foundation for realizing DID and future-proof tokenomics. We have defined tangible milestones along this Fund 6 journey. For transparency reasons we are establishing, maintaining and visualizing our Business Model Canvas, Activity Backlog and Kanban-Boards in MIRO. The successful deliveries according to our Fund 6 goals are crucial to qualify for next rounds of professional (also outside Catalyst) funding, which we will definitely need for reaching our ambitious long-term goals (find more details below).\n\n \n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nOur proposal is based on the anticipation that the methods of human learning and role of knowledge will undergo severe changes during the next years and decades. With the emergence of AI and RPA (Robotic Process Automation), a next wave of disruption will free humans from most repetitive tasks. This, on the other hand, will require a radical change of paradigms with respect to continuously acquiring and optimizing our human knowledge. We can see this as a threat or as a huge opportunity for making learning a joyous effort, supported by access to Internet, specific coaching and the availability of a personalized learning & knowledge tools like our ACADEMY Lifelong Learning Suite.\n\n \n\nImpact & Return of Intention\n\nThis proposal addresses a high-potential application suite outside the typical DEFI space. With digital identity as a key building block, ACADEMY suite aims to build a novel approach to personalized learning and proof of merits. This way, we will introduce the benefits of DLT/Blockchain/DID technologies based on CARDANO to a wide public. Even with starting humble and small, the number of potential users of the ACADEMY Suite in its early stages reaches from university students to language learners and more, and presents a solid foundation to build on for a much more far-reaching project.\n\n \n\nOur Vision - Dream big\n\nACADEMY is aiming to become a key player in the rapidly growing field of education technology, and add innovative solutions to pressing challenges facing society, integrating emerging technologies like blockchain and DID for real impact. Take a first glance at our ambitions and vision: \n\nhttps://www.academy-suite.com/\n\n(see also ACADEMY overview graphics under ATTACHMENT Folder below)\n\n \n\nWhat Distinguishes our Proposal\n\nAcademy has the objective of being a learning partner for capturing, retrieving, and refreshing personal knowledge. After building this important foundation, guided learning and gamified learning will come as advanced functionality later on our development journey. Academy is ready to hit the ground running. After completing the conception and design phase for Mindcards, we are ready to provide actual functionality within months.\n\n \n\nWhat Is MINDCARDS?\nMindmaps + Flashcards = Mindcards.\n\nWhile the equation is simple, the potential impact is asymmetrically powerful. Whatever you want to learn or memorize, Mindcards provides you with a space to structure your knowledge in a way that is conducive to the formation of your neural network.\n\n \n\nThis Proposal - Start Small\n\nDespite having an ambitious vision, we need to start small and step by step. This proposal focuses on the very basics of the ACADEMY Lifelong Learning Suite. Within Fund 6 we want to achieve the following:\n\nMVP with MINDCARDS, allowing real usage, adding value to first users/subscribers\nDefining the very foundational elements of the technical architecture\nLeveraging ATALA Prism for creating a digital identity based foundation (users, certificates, merits, etc.)\nFurther, advancing the overall business model with monetizing / tokenomics strategies\nRoadmap as well as mid- and long term scaling and financing concept\nCompleting the team with adding strong expertise, especially in the DLT/CARDANO/DID environment and partnerships with selected universities and education experts\n\n \n\nBusiness Model Canvas\n\nWithin this proposal, we are listing some key-facts of our business model based on a business model canvas approach. This represents a snapshot of our phase 1 approach, and will further evolve as the project progresses.\n\n \n\nTarget Customers (for this Basic approach in Fund 6)\n\nLanguage learners and rehearses\nStudents and lifelong learners of all kind\nLovers of Mindmaps and Flashcards (MINDCARDS)\n\n \n\nValue proposition\n\nSimple way of capturing important information – well-structured, easy to retrieve\nExcellent method for making the first steps in foreign languages\nClear message: You and your data are NOT the product. Privacy is key.\nDigital identity based proof of merits.\n\n \n\nRevenue Streams\n\nFree entry mode\nEarly supporter subscription\nPersonal Subscription\nGroup subscription \n\n \n\nChannels\n\nDuring our startup phase, we will utilize specific communities, universities and multiplication over personal networks for conveying our message and for signing up first customers. During MVP stage, ACADEMY Suite will be made accessible over attractively designed IOS and Android APP frontends. \n\n \n\nCustomer Relationships\n\nOur first customers will mainly be early adopters and people supporting our overall vision. Learning from CARDANO CATALYST, we will build a strong link with this group of early enthusiasts. This allows us to gain important insights and feedback for our further development journey. For the general users, we will establish a YouTube communication channel and In-App feedback loops. Our plan is to implement digital identity based proof of merits and loyality-schemes right from the beginning.\n\n \n\nKey Activities\n\nDuring the Fund 6 phase, we plan for the following key activities:\n\nVery careful completion of our team (adding outstanding DLT/Blockchain/Tokenomics/DID expertise)\nDetailed design of our short-, mid- and longterm business model based on DID and tokenomics\nDesigning the foundational technical architecture \nEstablishing the basic operational infrastructure (GitHub, starting DevSecOps process etc.)\nFine tuning of UX/UI approach\nDevelopment of our MVP\nSetting up guerilla marketing channels and activities\nSetting up basic customer interaction and service infrastructure\n\n \n\nKey Resources & Key Partners\n\nOur young and diverse team has a strong background in learning-methods and innovation, complemented by senior leadership experience in industry.\n\nJonas Weinberger (Brussels - Strategy) - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-weinberger-0b14801ba/\nGuilherme Pereira (São Paulo - Talent Hub) - https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-pereira-da-silva-977a361a3/\nHeinz Gassner (Malta - Technology and Business Development Advisor) - https://www.linkedin.com/in/heinz-gassner-9540a241/\n\n \n\nUX/design & frontend development partners (Cryberry Studio, São Paulo)\nSearching for complementary expertise in DLT/Blockchain/DID architecture and development\n\n \n\nCost Structure\n\nDesign of foundational architecture (DID/blockchain/tokenomics) 10 000 USD\nUX/UI fine tuning and development of MINDCARDS MVP (based on already existing prototype): 20 000 USD\nActivities related to further advancing business model and organization structure: 7 500 USD\nUser aquisition expenses for Mindcards MVP: 7 500 USD\n\n \n\nDefinition of Success\n\n3 Months:\n\nComplete team with required expert resources in place\nFoundational architecture blueprint in place\nUX/UI fine tuning completed\nWhitepaper laying out detailed strategic and technology concept, roadmap and milestones\nDetailed Business Model Canvas established for Phase 1 and beyond (in MIRO)\n\n \n\n6 Months:\n\nRequired operational infrastructure for working as globally distributed teams established\nFoundational-developments completed\nBasic integration of DID/tokenomics done \nCompleted development of Mindcards MVP\n\nPublic launch date of ACADEMY MVP based in MINDCARDS: May 2022\n\n \n\n12 Months:\n\nAchieved 5000+ downloads for Mindcards MVP\n2-3 partnerships with important multipliers in place (e.g. universities, learning content providers, relevant EU institutions)\n\n \n\nCheck out further background material: \n\nTo learn more, visit: https://www.academy-suite.com\n\nFurther material:","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368209-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWe have a working semantic model and lot's of data both from a wide anonymous and identified user base, both from corporate as well as from private users.

Imagine that this year it is expected that over 25 billion devices are already interconnected using IoT. But one of the big concerns with IoT is security as some of these devices are production line robots or nuclear plants safety systems, followed by scalability as the continuous growth pushes the boundaries of existing technologies.\n\nSmart contracts are agreements between two parties, stored in the Cardano blockchain, that can further enable the execution of contractual arrangements among different parties based on certain criteria being fulfilled. As examples we can think of different scenarios where smart contracts can authorize payments automatically, without any need for human intervention, when the conditions for providing a service have been fulfilled like we are seeing with the successful implementation for VET in the supply chain management or IOTA in the automotive industry.\n\nSmart contracts, due to be released on the Cardano main net on the 12th September, will bring the required innovation to make them a prime candidate for a compelling use case for IoT devices to send and receive data over the Internet without any human interaction, trustless and in a secure way. IoT devices span from everyday consumer products like smartwatches, WiFi-enabled appliances, and wireless headphones, to the intelligent infrastructure powering smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and smart factories, so the market is huge and demand for blockchain solutions in the IoT space will be significant.\n\nCardano blockchain can support IoT space growth by managing risks around security and scalability concerns associated with IoT:\n\n1️⃣ Because Cardano blockchain system is tamper-proof and furthermore is highly decentralized, IoT can work in a trustless way, without the need for trust among the involved parties. No single entity has control over the huge amount of data generated by IoT devices.\n\n2️⃣ Due to its cryptographic nature, blockchain can store IoT data using an additional security layer that hackers need to overcome to access the network. The level of encryption introduced by Cardano blockchain makes it virtually impossible to tamper with existing data.\n\n3️⃣ Cardano ledger allows authorized people to verify the authenticity of the stored data and track history of transactions in an unheard level of transparency. This can address efficiently any source of data leakages or incorrect data.\n\n4️⃣ Cardano blockchain can process transactions very fast and can makes coordination of billions of connected devices a trivial task. As the scale of IoT space increases, DLT (distributed ledger technology) can ensure a suitable platform to enable the processing of a huge amount of transactions.\n\n5️⃣ Since Cardano blockchain works in a trustless, it ensures IoT organizations and customers can decrease associated costs by making redundant the need for a 3rd party to be compensated for coordinating IoT gateways like in the existing traditional IoT protocols.\n\n \n\n👥 Team founders:\n\nPaval Cosmin - Role: Operations and finance / Location: RO 🇷🇴 EU 🇪🇺 / Expertise: Management, ITIL Best Practices, Prince2 Project Management, ISO 27001 Lead Implementer, Cloud Service Delivery and Operations / Profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cosminpaval/\n\nPatrick Sturm - Role: Tech Lead / Location: AU 🇭🇲 / Expertise: Software development.\n\n \n\nAs part of this proposal we aim to develop the MVP use case for Cardano to start playing a key role in the IoT space.\n\n \n\nRoadmap and budget required:\n\n1st - 3rd month: create the framework of IoT devices registry - 2,000 $\n\n4th - 6th month: develop Arduino blockchain connection library - 2,500 $\n\n6th - 9th month: design & build an MVP IoT device management platform - 3,000 $\n\n9th - 12th month: market the MVP and establish partnerships to further develop - 2,499 $\n\n \n\nSupport us to secure funding and continue serving our community:\n\n🎯 VOTE!

For example: a county can onboard their historical land deeds and start registering new properties with their new internal workflow management system; meanwhile the user can accept and store their land deed on their digital wallet. \n\nDEFINITION OF SUCCESS:\n\n- Have an architecture of the data model and governance that is going to be applied for different cities, counties and states and how it will be implemented. \n\n- Have at least 1 county/city/state partnered with to issue at least one type of transaction. \n\n-Have 1 web app and 1 phone app that allows for the interaction.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368080-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRevisiting the Problem Statement\n\nOne of the main reasons distributed organisations or cooperatives cannot transition to a sustainable reward system is the lack of a trusted & working mechanism to track, to attribute value and to successively reward contributions of individuals.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Experimental Solution\n\nTo develop an open-source attribution, valuation & reward system - we are going to set up, configure and test a SourceCred instance in parallel with a contribution survey.

Investors commit to providing funding. If the proposal targets are reached, ADA are held in a \"treasury\" and $time tokens are released to investors proportionately (each representing 1 hour of actual work by the Rockstar) with some kept back as rewards / incentives for the Rockstar to reach certain milestones. ADA is never distributed to the Rockstar directly, but rather through a \"partner / supplier\" ecosystem to ensure it is used correctly, and these payment events are voted upon by Investors (based on their $time token holdings). Investors are able to trade tokens, but also \"cancel\" them - receiving back a proportion of the ADA remaining in the proposal treasury - meaning that $time tokens will always have a \"minimum\" value - ie the proportionate value of the ADA in the treasury at any point in time. Of course, the idea is that the value of the $time token is also linked to the value of that 1 hour redeemable for actual work performed by the Rockstar - e.g. Lawyer, Doctor, Data Scientist, Cloud Engineer - and therefore becomes an effective means of accessing / investing in this class of skill.\n\nKeep in mind that $time token are specific to each individual - ie they would have a separate minting policyIds backing them - per proposal (in Plutus speak) - which is such a perfect fit!\n\nPartner / Supplier Ecosystem\n\nThere is huge potential for bridges to be built to other decentralised businesses, such as a few that are already being contemplated for Fund 6. For example, funds raised in a Rockstar contract could easily be disbursed into a Tutorchain contract via a bridge, allowing for training to be provided with a reputable tutor or mentor. Other partners could provide contracts for certifications (e.g. Plutus Pioneers, AWS, or PluralSight), and others could provide raw resources, such as access to cloud computing infrastructure for machine learning training. \n\nPartners & Suppliers would have to be managed and vetted via a decentralised mechanism, and this is where it becomes a little more complex as to exactly how this happens - and therefore the initial idea is to maintain a list of pre-vetted partners, and slowly allow the model to evolve (such as how Cardano block producing was initially bootstraped in a centralised way). Probably something like Atala PRISM would help here, providing some sense of identity for both Rockstars and partners.\n\n$time token trading\n\nInvestors could have many reasons for buying $time tokens, but probably there are two main reasons. \n\nFirstly, they might genuinely foresee a demand for a particular skill at a future date - for example a Bank might be embarking on a multi-year cloud transformation project, which they predict will require a large amount of cloud engineering skills. They could therefore choose to invest in a number of Rockstars who have cloud engineering on their career path, buying up that time at a reduced price, and then holding those $time tokens until they have matured and redeeming them for delivery on their cloud projects. This would be an alternative to a traditional \"intern\" model, or graduate recruitment programme. \n\nThe second type of investor could be more of a pure speculator - someone who has identified a trend, and wants to invest early in the trend. For example \"how do i go long on cloud computing?\". With Project Rockstar, you simply buy up $time tokens that fit your predicted skill, and then take part in mentoring and growing those individuals along a path towards increasing the value in the individual. At some point into the future you can then sell those tokens to whoever requires them at that point in time, or convert them fluidly into the next big demand skill, and continue the cycle. Everyone wins.   \n\nDevelopment Phases\n\nDevelopment will be split into 2 major phases, with the intention to build some momentum from a simple, but fully functional MVP in phase 1.\n\nPhase 1 - MVP of basics\n\nThis will be developed through the funding provided by Fund 6. Still to be fleshed out in more details, but high-level components include:\n\nSimple \"parameterised\" proposals (Plutus/Marlowe smart-contracts)\nSimple portal to Pitch, Invest and Launch (fund raising portal)\nSimple DAO functionality (principle proposes, investors vote, disburse, cancel and redeem tokens)\nFixed, vetted, 3rd party providers (training, certification, equipment, etc - maybe start with centralised vetting)\n\nPhase 2 - High value next steps\n\nThe next iteration under consideration, highly flexible and based on demand\n\nOpen 3rd party providers (based on some sort of decentralised vetting process)\nDEX for trading of time tokens\nRemote video conferencing facility, allowing for direct redemption of time tokens 1-on-1 between principle individual and token holder, potentially including a scheduling, project management and team management (i.e. allowing for more than 1 individual redeeming time in parallel for a single investor)\n\nFAQ Zone\n\nClarifications based on some great questions and discussions with the community\n\nHow is this not digital slavery (ie selling an obligation for future work)?\n\n$time tokens can be considered \"obligations to work\" - but of course this model would not work as the Rockstar could simply run away and make themselves unavailable. The model is not yet fully described in the proposal, but the idea is that Rockstars would \"earn\" $time tokens back as they \"work\" with a token holder. Keeping in mind that $time tokens are \"cancellable\" against the treasury, they actually represent real world tangible value (as opposed to \"hype\" value in the example of humanipo). For example, if the Rockstar works 10 hours, she earns 10 $time tokens, which can be cancelled at her treasury for 20 ADA each (and obviously the ratio of $time to ADA is dependent on the launch parameters of her contract). Of course the Rockstar could also re-sell those earned $time tokens back to the market at a higher value, should the \"hype\" mean there is a higher demand for that particular skill.\n\nThe idea of capturing real value (via ADA) into the contract is key to this - there is no need to generate hype - you can simply look at the value of the treasury and divide it by the number of $time tokens in circulation - and thats the minimum value of that $time token (taking into account funds provisioned for spending against the career path - but i'm trying to keep it simple). As the value of the skill in the market increases, the value of the \"hour\" of time would increase, more trading/earning would occur, and therefore more value would be captured in the treasury in a feedback loop, lifting the minimum value of the $time token. Eventually the Rockstar could even earn back all of their $time tokens, and decide to exit by cancelling the full set, redeeming all the value in the treasury - this would be analogous to \"retiring\" in the real world. \n\nIt should now be clear that this model is very inspired by Cardano's own treasury model, including the Catalyst mechanism!\n\nAnother important factor is to limit the total supply of $time token - my initial thinking is approx 1,000 per Rockstar contract. This is close to 6 months of full-time work for an individual - which feels like a manageable time horizon. Of course this needs testing, and it's possible that a much smaller value would work better to try to find a good balance between total value of treasury vs incentive to hold/earn tokens. Testing would take place with the first cohort of \"pilot\" Rockstars.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367982-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nCurrent personal health data lacks precision and the ability to empower the user.\n\nBeing able to document personal health data simply and efficiently on a regular basis would dramatically improve the deeper understanding of health issues and prevention capabilities. This information should be owned by the individual in a secure and lasting way, and be usable between services, applications and practitioners.\n\nTo solve this major issue we are proposing to build a mobile app using Unreal Engine to create a beautiful, interactive holistic health tool. This app will provide a universal holistic health identity, and will be able to connect with services such as The Dyana project (our holistic health protocol), but also medical analysis (such as microbiote, epigenetic, blood analysis…). It will enable the use of digital currencies to pay for such health related services.\n\nIt will be a leap into the future, with interactive crystalline human that can be used to portray the interrelationship between our mind and body.\n\nConnection with Wolfram Alpha will provide in-depth data on organs and diseases, helping to develop a deeper inner understanding and shifting attention towards the body's \"small signals\", ultimately driving the industry towards more prevention.\n\nIntegration with SingularityNet will expand even more the possibilities.\n\nHealth is a crucial part of our identity, as it involves our own living being. By using this DID we will drive a global change towards a more inclusive health system, in which our complexity can be explored and visualized in a precise way, enabling more global approaches and knowledge.\n\n \n\n \n\nTEAM\n\nAntoine Cathalau\n\nAntoine has been a project designer and meditation teacher for more than 10 years.\n\nHe co-founded Suki editions, a digital studio, in which he created ebooks, mobile apps and web projects related to holistic health.\n\nTwitter : @AGarance, @SukiEditions\n\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/antoine-cathalau-b8860443\n\n \n\n \n\nClaire Pichelin\n\nClaire is the other co-founder of Suki editions.

So, meeting the challenge to improve and grow auditability requires a distributed approach. An effective and equitable distribution of auditability will require connections between the funded proposer and the community to be established, the communal development of transparent audit methods and constant iteration.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRevisiting the Problem Statement\n\nProject Catalyst is rapidly expanding, and its decentralized funding platform needs to develop common audit standards to apply to its funded proposals. At large scale if there is no way to compare the performance of proposals then there is no means by which return on intent can be assessed.\n\nNo consistent evaluation will lead to a lack of understanding of why proposals fail or succeed. This will obscure what can be learnt from the Catalyst experiment.\n\nManual reporting is time-consuming, prone to error and creates inconsistencies between proposals.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSolution Overview\n\nDrawing on lessons learnt to date tracking and documenting Catalyst Swarm and Quality Assurance DAO this proposal will research reporting workflows, then develop and deploy automated reporting & tracking using Continuous Integration tools such as GitHub Actions.\n\nA library of Continuous Integration tools will assist with consistent evaluation of funded proposals and make reporting processes more transparent.\n\nAutomated reporting & tracking is less time-consuming than manual reporting. Each event is run through a batch process that exposes any errors and is reproducible; thereby promoting consistent reporting.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Relevant experience (identifying information)\n\nStephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects. Relevant experience for this proposal includes Program Test Management (IBM) and Quality Assurance Management (BNP-Paribas).\n\nHe currently develops, maintains documentation and provides technical project management support for Catalyst Swarm.\n\nIn Fund 5 of Project Catalyst Stephen's QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) submitted a proposal \"Quality Assurance DAO\" in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge that was funded in August 2021.\n\nStephen provides support to Catalyst Swarm by documenting and tracking it's activities. This has been done continuously since 7th July 2021 by raising GitHub issues that track Core Swarm Activities such as meetings, After Town Halls, events (Idea Fest) and Saturday Swarm Sessions. The evolution of the governance of Catalyst Swarm is documented and updated here - https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/governance/overview .\n\nYou can support the activities of QA-DAO by becoming a GitHub sponsor https://github.com/sponsors/Quality-Assurance-DAO .\n\n​https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-whitenstall-166727210\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoadmap\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe present – Fund 5 QA-DAO proposal and community collaborations.\n\nIn August 2021 the F5: Developer ecosystem proposal Quality-Assurance-DAO ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Quality-Assurance-DAO/351678-48088 ) was successful in receiving votes and was funded. This confirmed that voters wish to see Quality Assurance Implemented in Project Catalyst and provides support for this proposal.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhase 0 : Prior to Funding - Research and prototyping – present to November 2021\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch\n\nHow different teams and individuals report the progress of their funded proposals will be researched.\n\nThis Fund 6 Auditability proposal will draw upon the successful Fund 5 Developer ecosystem proposal for research. This will be done in collaboration with the funded cohort, IOG and Catalyst ecosystem toolmakers such as Catalyst Swarm.\n\nLessons Learnt to date\n\nThe ongoing experience of working with a widely distributed team such as Catalyst Swarm, working on many different projects, has led to automation solutions such as Issue templates and forms.\n\nQualitative lessons have also been learnt within Catalyst Swarm in respect of the amount of reporting and tracking required. In terms of what is manageable and what is meaningful to team members. The best incentive is a team understanding of who contributes what to a project - so that work is fairly attributed and costed.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhase 1 - Continuous Integration Development - November 2021 to December 2021\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce funded Distributed Auditability will build upon lessons learnt in research and prototyping to automate reporting & tracking using Continuous Integration tools such as GitHub Actions.\n\nBuilding on prototypes from Phase 0 specific auditing workflows will be automated using GitHub Actions.\n\nAuditability Workflows\n\nData from funded cohort reporting, Swarm tracking and qualitative research (into how reporting varies) will inform the design of auditability workflows. An auditability workflow will model the working practices of participants, the metrics they report on, whether this fit into their own documentation and how they might benefit from automation.\n\nAuditability Workshops\n\nIn addition a related proposal Open-Source-Training ( F6: DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox proposal ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Source-Training/368678-48088 ) offered in collaboration with the Catalyst School will will offer workshops to assist early stage entrepreneurs in discovering their workflows and examining how these may be documented, reported on and automated. If the Open-Source-Training is funded data from workshop workflows will also feedback into Continuous Integration Development.\n\nContinuous Integration Development\n\nAuditability workflows identified from tracking and research will be translated to GitHub Actions for development and testing.\n\nThis will comprise of :\n\nBatch jobs that will raise & close tracking issues, meeting minutes, contribution surveys and biweekly reports automatically.\n\n \n\nInterface with Catalyst Fund data to prefill issue templates & reports.\n\n \n\nInterface with and update static site website with team workflow status and reporting.\n\n \n\nSetup trigger events on pull requests.\n\n \n\nSending status bots to Discord servers.\n\n \n\n \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhase 2 -

The group was contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\n\nIOG CEO Charles Hoskinson recently outlined a major, ambitious vision for shaping up a long-term roadmap pushing Cardano towards 2025.\n\nSome elements of the vision include first completing Ouroboros Omega (which will be available by end of 2021), as a capstone of research. Elements that will be explored are fast finality, sidechains, no reliance on external clocks, the ability to gracefully recover from 51% attacks, plus a little faster TPS.\n\nThe 2025 agenda will includes reaching Ouroboros Omega++.\n\nAnother part of the roadmap is Light Clients (such as Yoroi) which are easy to do with trust assumptions (someone running a server that is a window into the system). There are other protocols on the market such as MINA that uses recursive SNARKs that proof that the coins exist and have not been spent - even without having a copy of the blockchain.\n\nIOG's paper on the Mithral Protocol is expected to come out by end of 2021 and possibly a prototype, with the idea of creating a similar trust model that would allow a light client by default. \n\nFor a sidechains model and layer 2 infrastructure, IOG is exploring adding sidechains support for EVM, IELE, Catalyst, etc. via a community approved hard-fork combinator event following a Cardano Improvement Proposal. \n\nPrism and DID embedding is also in the pipeline for authenticated wallets and regulated DeFi spaces, permissioned for access with certain credentials and leading to Human Readable Addresses. \n\nAnother piece of off-chain infrastructure is Hydra, based on a four paper agenda (two finished, two to be finished by end of 2021). Hydra is a craft-on layer two solution that SPOs will be able to add on. With you have a Cardano DApp you will be able to use Prism for free, as well as using Hydra. \n\nOther elements mentioned in scope for 2025 include: quantum resistance, zero-knowledge crypto, quantum resistance with the signature scheme, how to use quantum computers to enhance Cardano, modelling quantum adversaries - a big Quantum agenda. \n\nOn the governance side, a lot of work will be done to link Catalyst (concerned with Treasury) with Voltaire (concerned with Protocol updates). The unification will start in 2021, extending and finishing in 2022. The governance system will probably be a bicameral voting model with feedback, expert ballots, correct economics.\n\nIn a April 5 2021 video, Hoskinson stated that IOG's aim is to overbuild the governance stuff in Catalyst and Voltaire by adding other voting systems, such as preference voting, quadratic voting, all of which will be available for use in DApps. \n\nIOG will also launch a research agenda to move from a plutocratic model (right now) to a hybrid model (ADA + Proof of Merit). This segment is closer to the 2025 part of the 2021-25 research agenda. The idea is to use different resources inside the system, as people build identity and reputation inside the system. \n\n \n\nCHALLENGE BRIEF:\n\nAs Cardano is a decentralized project and community, the IOG-proposed roadmap is clearly a major contribution for the ecosystem - but it does not eliminate the possibility of alternative and complementary visions. The roadmap that is expected later this year - will also serve as a foundational platform for many more complementary projects, visions, teams and strategies that can start building upon its vision. \n\nThe brief for this Challenge is to propose new mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools for development (or the expansion of existing mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools) to start working on creating community-based ideas for the Cardano 2025 roadmap. \n\nThe future development of Cardano is being planned and decided soon and the community needs to step up and participate. \n\n \n\n Important note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge!\n\nThe proposed budget of this proposal will serve to fund multiple proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge.\n\nI have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if voters select this as a future Challenge.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366983-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366990-48088"},{"content":"Challenge brief\n\nIn a proof of stake system with distributed governance a common understanding of truth and reliance on authentic sources of correct and provable information can be crucial for avoiding a splitting of the community into two or more feuding camps.\n\nA distributed denial-of-truth (DDoT) attack could be defined as a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal operations of a community, service or network by overwhelming the target, its surrounding infrastructure and community with a flood of disinformation and malinformation.\n\nDisinformation is fabricated or deliberately manipulated audio/visual/text content, intentionally created conspiracy theories or rumors or to sow mistrust. With disinformation the bad information is spread with the intent to deceive.\n\nMalinformation is the deliberate publication of information for personal or corporate rather than public interest.

This can be done with the help of some major holders/exchanges/rival coins/investors and/or media personalities.\n\nWe are all aware how a single person (Elon Musk) is already able to move crypto markets, while a handful of prominent Cardano personas with outside support might be able to do the same.\n\nProposers in this challenge would focus on improving the transparency of all segments of Cardano treasury monetary transfers and make \"beginner-friendly\" tutorials on how to monitor financial events from the very inception of Cardano and its main founding entities. \n\nProposers would also focus on shining a powerful light on old and new attempts to game the system, further scams, fleece users, sow distrust, spread lies and destabilize the community.\n\nMany possible DDoT scenarios may evolve if the Cardano community is not proactively working to prevent them. \n\n \n\nOne invented - example DDoT scenario to illustrate how things can go wrong fast: \n\nExample scenario involving bad faith: A former/current head or founder or leading researcher/manager of one of the three founding entities of Cardano issues an untrue statement questioning the legitimacy of efforts/intentions of another founding entity or possible financial shenanigans.\n\nSeveral prominent community SPOs side with the accusing entity, as do several leading Youtube influencers and crypto media. Other side with the accused side. Some companies start distancing themselves.\n\nRumors circulate that one founding entity allegedly secretly siphoned funds and that has been done behind the scenes. Another rumor circulates that one of the Cardano entities has installed a backdoor and several SPOs announce they have reduced their pledges out of fear. Panic spreads. The allegations are amplified through social media.\n\nTruth is hard to establish - references are made to talks and private discussions, public allegations are difficult to verify.\n\nThe general community has no way to verify the true merits of the claims - as they are undocumented. Two camps emerge. Cardano community splits along fault lines. This adds more fuel to the fire. ADA value plunges. The very sources of truth in the Cardano ecosystem come under question. The entire system teeters. A DDOT attack by a group of two dozen well organized distributed players is underway. Governance is rocked.\n\n===\n\nReminder: One of the three founding entities has previously been led by a person who was widely seen as pursuing particular interests ahead of the common good. \"Following the resignation, Hoskinson said: \"Now that Parsons is gone, the Foundation needs to work very hard to restore its trust, faith, and credibility within the Cardano community…\" This shows that even such an example scenario is not fully implausible. \n\n \n\nhttps://www.cbinsights.com/research/future-of-information-warfare/\n\n \n\n \n\nImportant note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7.

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community's support and build on or use the Cardano network.\n\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\n\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\n\nCardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let's build upon that.\n\nWhat this is:\n\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\n\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\n\nIt is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed. \n\nChallenge Team\n\nThis proposal seeks to include a challenge team. Unfortunately, the proposer's have not had time to fully form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review.

This makes the whole of catalyst an experiment for this specific system. Preferably their would be a way to create controlled experiments to try out several different systems, in a comparable manner. \n\n \n\nThere are a lot of ideas and proposals which aim too introduce changes to the system, related to voting, assessments, the proposal system, and so on. The question is how can they be adopted into the system? If there is only one system governing all funds, changing it comes with a lot of risk. If instead some Challenges use their own system, they can serve as isolated experiments.\n\n \n\nProposals in the Challenge Setting category could introduce changes within their scope by including them in the challenge description. Some changes might be easier to implement than others and some might require entire side chain solutions. Currently the responsibility to deliver these solutions lies with the Catalyst team. This Challenge aims too support initiatives that make these kind of changes possible and to start taking ownership as a community over this part of the infrastructure.   \n\n \n\nGuiding Questions:\n\n- Which proposals would allow alternative systems to be used within Catalyst\n\n- Which proposals provide a technical bridge between Ideascale, Cardano mainnet & Yormungander and community tools\n\n- Which initiatives provide support for challenge teams \n\n \n\nExample directions:\n\n- Design alternative models & frameworks for Challenges\n\n- develop models/Tools/Smart contracts to facilitate Challenge specific CA's, voting, fund distribution\n\n- Organising challenge specific groups (experts, mentors, auditors)\n\n- Develop platforms for everyone participating in a challenge to connect & share\n\n- integrations with Ideascale and other Catalyst systems\n\n \n\nSuccess of this challenge would see outcomes from the proposals being incorporated by Challenge Setting proposers and Challenge Teams. Such adoptions can be seen as a means of validation of the quality of the outcomes. In turn, systems that proof to work when they are used in a challenge can naturally lead too adoption by other challenge proposers. \n\n \n\nBudget reasoning:\n\nThe challenge focusses on improving the internal governance systems. If we assume a 5-10% budget on improving the governance, this budget fills a recent portion of it, while leaving room for  some other challenges.\n\n \n\nTo provide an example of altering the rules for a challenge, the following changes are proposed to be included for the scope of this challenge:\n\nFund Allocation based on voting:\n\n- Remaining funds must match >= 90% of proposed funds or else a proposal is skipped (as opposed to 100%)\n\nReasoning for the rule: If a proposal receives at least 90% of it's proposed budget, it should be able to deliver on it's intial goals.

This challenge seeks to foster inclusive and welcoming environments and remove barriers for people from all cultures, backgrounds to join the Catalyst ecosystem and participate in meaningful ways through a focus on increasing the awareness of and building mechanisms to encourage greater diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\nThis challenge is about human networking, encouraging and fostering communication between groups and individuals, and increasing the diversity in the Catalyst ecosystem through creating safe, welcoming, and exciting spaces for people to feel welcome. There is tremendous value to the entire Catalyst ecosystem in connecting, extending, and growing our human networks and opening up silos to more collaborative engagement.\nThe value of a network grows exponentially (see: Metcalf's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law)) as more and more connections and nodes are added. Let's grow our human network and bring as many people into our ecosystem as possible. Through increasing diversity and inclusion, this challenge will act as an accelerator for uncovering and fostering creativity, and encouraging serendipitous discovery and collaboration by helping people and projects in the ecosystem connect and collaborate.\nInvesting sufficiently now, to increase diversity in our community will pay off more and more over time as the community grows. This challenge is seeking $150,000 to ensure that we put enough attention on encouraging projects that increase diversity and inclusion and grow our community to many different parts of the planet and including more and more voices from under-represented communities and demographics. It is envisioned that this budget will help support translations and accessibility improvements, bring in initiatives and projects that remove barriers, ease on-boarding, and welcome diverse participants.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368363-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368366-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368367-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368373-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368385-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368387-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368388-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368426-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368444-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368445-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368463-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368470-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368481-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368485-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368486-48088"},{"content":"Challenge brief\n\nThis challenges aims too support the development of common tools needed for projects to make use of the cardano blockchain. \n\n \n\nBriefing\n\nThere are core functionalities that almost all Dapp projects need like querying the blockchain, managing wallets, creating transactions. These functionalities  should be freely available to all and be owned by the community. Some of these solutions are currently only easily available as Software as a Service solution.  If most Dapps are build on top of the same proprietary solutions to access the blockchain, however, this leads to centralization and introduces risk. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe goal of Cardano is to also include those who are currently being left out. If the best tools build with the community fund are behind a pay wall this creates an unfair playing field. Anyone who wants to start building on top of cardano should be able to easily configure a node with the utilities they need. Anyone who is hosting a node (as SPO or otherwise) should be able to easily add on and offer additional services as they see fit.\n\n \n\n \n\nLarge scale projects and singular solutions have proven to be inflexible and the industry is focusing on compositional design. Modern micro service architecture and solutions like containerization allow for common utilities to be developed as self-hosted independent building blocks. This approach allows projects to focus on a single functionality reducing the risk for the whole community. \n\n \n\nGuiding questions:\n\n- How can we ensure future developers benefit from the work that is funded today?\n\n- How do we promote a decentralised  and self-hosted ecosystem?\n\n- How do we align between different open source community efforts?\n\n \n\npossible directions:\n\n- developing common tools as libraries or containerized services\n\n- incentive system for developing & hosting common open source utility's\n\n- common audited repositories & overviews for open source solutions\n\n- organising events to bring the open source community together\n\n- collaborations/efforts on defining common standards\n\n \n\nThe Budget is set to be an additional 10% of the current proposed dev ecosystem challenge.\n\n \n\nChallenge Team:\n\nDue to time constraints and the short notice a team has not been officially formed. There has been contact with several other community members who have shown an interest. If the Challenge gets accepted a team will be formed and rewards would be shared fairly. The current member has experience with facilitating sessions, writing proposals and has experience working on open source projects as a developer & a product owner. \n\nThe Challenge team will try to work with existing open source intitiatives too provide proposers a way for proposers to build part of their roadmap.

While a variety of projects push for the adoption of DeFi on Cardano, can we bring to market the potential of DeFi mechanisms as a vehicle for social good?\n\nDelivering an outcome that has an impact is a lot harder than just delivering a financial Return-on-Investment, even a small one. Impact investing (according to the World Economic Forum) is hindered by:\n\nThe lack and/or high cost of trustworthy data on the social or environmental results of investment, making credible accounting of impacts difficult.\nChallenges around the \"attribution\" of impact – meaning the allocation of an impact-related claim to an investor risks \"double-counting.\"\nRoadblocks in monetizing impacts – illiquid impact markets, uncertain returns, high transaction costs.\n\nPropose market solutions, financial mechanisms, or means of measuring impact. Think about how these can be deployed at scale to affect positively millions of people. Think about how the results of your proposal can be embedded or reused in different market contexts, or integrated with existing providers.\n\nIgniting impact investment on Cardano will provide capital to address the world's most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.\n\nTo achieve impact requires cooperation and collaboration, something Cardano can enable. Could the answer to better managing the world's resources lie not in government or big investors but instead in technologies that empower peer-to-peer assistance. Community-based finance or data-driven crowdfunding for instance. How can we leverage the awesome power of the Cardano ecosystem to be that catalyst?\n\nChallenge Team\n\nThis proposal can and should be a challenge team proposal. Unfortunately, the proposer's have not had time to form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review. If possible, we intend to help form that team before voting commences.\n\nThe role of Challenge Teams is to steward the challenges in Catalyst - to present the challenge, track the progress, and report back to the community their perspective on whether the challenges were addressed.\n\nIf you are interested in being part of that team, please let us know in the comments.\n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS IN OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE\n\nhttps://c3eth.github.io/catalyst/fund6/challenge-setting-proposals/grow-social-finance/","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368902-48088"},{"content":"Challenge brief\n\nCardano received the \"ghostchain\" nickname by many skeptics, despite the number of SPOs, developers in the Plutus Pioneer Program, community engagement in social media, and several other metrics saying otherwise.\n\n \n\nMany in our community embraced the term \"ghost\" in a positive way. Some of these \"ghosts\" are extremely dedicated and talented people, but they need and deserve greater reach and support in the community.\n\nSince Shelley's launch, one of the issues that has created long and fruitless debates has been about the sustainability and the difficulty of small SPOs raise delegation versus large pool groups (like Binance), SPOs with multi-pools (like 1PCT) and SPOs influencers (I won't quote them, but you know who they are). I want to make it clear that this is all in the rules of the game, but it doesn't mean that it is good for decentralization.\n\nWe know that the K parameter and pledge are important for defining the theoretical number of SPOs, but marketing capacity and social outreach distort the playing field, harming and overshadowing small SPOs. \n\nHow can we level the playing field with sustainable, rational and aove all, free market incentives?\n\n \n\nFurthermore, Catalyst has been an amazing funding option for developers in the Cardano community, but the 3-month cycle of each Fund can dampen innovation. Some projects need quick funding sources. Some projects could be funded by the community itself. Not every good proposal fits a challenge. There is demand for alternative funding models, so why not create space for them outside Catalyst?\n\n \n\nEach team can request up to 25% of the total $100,000 USD budget\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $12,500 USD\nTeam B with 5 proposals of $5,000 USD\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $25,000 USD\nTeam D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $10,000 USD\n\nDue to the experimental and new nature of the challenge I think it is appropriate to set a relatively low budget ($100,000 USD) but a sufficient amount to address a problem that has been regularly debated in the community and which to date there is no clear solution. The idea of limiting a team to requesting up to 25% of the budget is to allow for a greater diversity of ideas and approaches to solving the problem.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum, any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\n \n\nPotential Directions\n\nMarketing teams to promote small SPOs\nAlternative Reward Models (FISO, NFT aidrops)\nCrowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms\nCreating advanced filters for selecting small SPOs\nMulti delegation research\nExplorers and adaptation of wallets to build multi delegation portfolios\n\nIn this video Sebastien Guillemot( Former co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo and dcSpark CTO and co founder) explains the importance of pools distribution(consensus distribution) to increase reliability and assurances for users and dapps on the blockchain:","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368940-48088"},{"content":"Challenge brief\n\nTHIS CHALLENGE INTENDED TO REPLACE \"Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\".\n\n \n\nThe previous challenge(ScaleUP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem) demonstrated success and allowed popular DeFi projects such as Liqwid Finance, Minswap and ErgoDEX to be funded by the treasury, without the participation of venture capitals and with fair launch models, allowing sustainable distribution of the supply among the community/userbase.\n\nThe fact that ERGODEX's proposal was the second best voted proposal in the Left-Over budget is an important indicator to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposals presented in Fund5.\n\n \n\nCurrently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.\n\nOver the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.\n\nIn this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\n\nCardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.\n\nWith Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.\n\n \n\nThe DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users' needs.\n\nIt has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains\n\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix\n\n \n\nCardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.\n\n \n\nPrivacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?\n\n \n\nPOTENTIAL DIRECTIONS\n\nDEXs\nOracles\nAlgorithmic stable coins\nBorrowing/Lending dapps\nDerivatives\nResearch for open source new financial models (bonding curves)\n\n \n\nRATIONAL FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION\n\nTo encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to 20% of the total $500,000 USD budget or $100,000 USD.\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $50,000 USD\nTeam B with 1 proposal of $100,000 USD\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $80,000 USD + 1 proposal of $20,000 US\n\n t is important to note that 20% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 5 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\n \n\nRATIONAL FOR BUDGET EXPANSION\n\nThe 500,000 USD budget has been set so that it can accommodate the demand seen in previous Funds for DeFi-related proposals in the \"Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. \n\nDeFi projects tend to involve higher costs than conventional dapps due to the nature of DeFi dapps requiring high levels of assurances, after all they are mission critical applications and the smart contracts of these dApps will guarantee the safety of users and large amounts of money.\n\nThese development costs puts pressure on teams to break the budget needed into different proposals across multiple Funds. On one hand, budget fragmentation allows the community to assess performance before committing to allocate a large amount of funds, but on the other hand the need to create proposals in consecutive Funds creates friction for the proposers and increases the workload of CAs across multiple Funds. Another negative aspect is that budget fragmentation ends up damming (like water in a dam) the need for funding and causing proposals to actually end up being funded for development that has already been completed, which is a barrier to innovation.\n\nLooking at the data associated with proposals related to DeFi in Fund5, I noticed that some proposals were submitted in the \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenge. There are some reasons that may justify these proposers choices, such as lack of knowledge about the specific challenge for DeFi (Scale UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem) or the preference for competing in another challenge that could be less competitive, which would also be a problem since the challenge of \"Dapps & Integrations\" has been extremely competitive in the last Funds. Below is an image (Image 2) to illustrate the number of approved proposals and proposals that did not receive funding on the Dapps & Integrations Challenge.\n\nThe creation of this challenge(Boosting Cardano's DeFi) can also relieve the pressure for competition in the Dapps & Integrations challenge and make room for dapps that have other use cases besides DeFi.\n\nTo bring more data to my arguments, I created a chart (Image 3) aggregating the DeFi proposals that were in the \"Scale UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. The intention is to demonstrate the demand for dapps directly related to DeFi.\n\nWhen looking at the DeFi-related proposals that have been approved but not funded, we can see that there are 5 (1 funded by left-over funds , 3 in the Dapps & Integration challenge, and the last in the \"Scale Up Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" challenge). These 5 proposals added together requested around $260,000USD.\n\nIn the image 4 it is possible to see several dapp projects related to DeFi that are being developed on Cardano (DEXs, Lending+Borrowing, Stable Coins, Synthetic Assets, Oracles, Derivatives and Insurance)","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368950-48088"},{"content":"Challenge brief\n\nThe idea behind this challenge is to fund specialists in regulation, lawyers and politicians who can promote the creation of an environment of laws that are more favorable or less harmful to the crypto space, with a focus on PoS and on Cardano's particularities.\n\nThrough this challenge, we can fund proposals that seek the adoption of Cardano in certain jurisdictions, as happened recently with Bitcoin in El Salvador. \n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/07/bitcoin-now-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-marking-world-first/\n\nLobby and educate rational politicians so that it becomes possible to plead for the creation of more favorable rules on taxation, use of cryptocurrencies and greater privacy for cryptocurrency users.\n\n \n\nIn August 2021, the US Senate voted for unforgiving legislation on the crypto ecosystem.

Paramount to our success is scaling how our community functions and decides on fair and just allocation of our treasury, measuring its impact, and continuously evolving and improving.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369166-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369179-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369187-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369192-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369215-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369218-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369236-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369238-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369251-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369264-48088"},{"content":"\n\nChallenge brief\n\n\nOur SPOs are a most-valuable foundation of Cardano.

More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains.\n\nWith the world increasingly facing the extremely damaging impacts of climate change upon ecosystems, populations and species, the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C cannot be contested. Alarming data includes the loss of primary rainforest equivalent to a football pitch every 6 seconds in 2019 leading to dramatic consequences such as soil erosion, flooding, loss of biodiversity, carbon release or fishery livelihoods being threatened in small island developing countries, or the Coral Triangle region in South-East Asia due to warming water temperatures and coral bleaching.\n\nAt the core of the 2020-2030 decade of action is the need for action to tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency. Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nSustainable development calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for people and planet.\n\nFor sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. These elements are interconnected, and all are crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.\n\nAction against climate change entails structural behavioural change at an individual and systemic level to embed sustainable practices.\n\nThis will entail the transition and adoption of frameworks of thinking that ensure sustainability is embedded at all levels of action. From our planetary boundaries to our core social foundations, including all strata of society.\n\n• Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To this end, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.\n\n• Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives. #ForPeopleForPlanet\n\n• To achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, annual investment requirements across all sectors have been estimated at around $5-7 trillion. Current investment levels are far from the scale needed. With global financial assets estimated at over $200 trillion, financing is available, but most of these resources are not being channelled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed necessary to achieve the SDGs and objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\n• Interest and investment in the Sustainable Development Goals are growing and investment in the Goals makes economic sense. Achieving the SDGs could open up US$12 trillion of market opportunities and create 380 million new jobs by 2030.\n\nCardano Sustainability\n\nEncouraging the growth of a Community Led Local Hubs Network as a means of accelerating and expanding the Cardano ecosystem in strategic places for high SDG impact:\n\nOut of the world's approximately 7.8 billion inhabitants, 6.45 billion do not speak English as their first language. Living in the Western world, one may forget this fact, with many never having considered it.\n\nLet's consider it now.\n\nLet's build an ecosystem that grows sustainably, in harmony from the local to global scale, while remaining inclusive and equitable.\n\nWhen you drive grassroots adoption, you do more than just 'build cool products'; you empower people to change their lives and world in previously unimaginable ways. You give them the tools to imagine that anything is possible.\n\nRemember that the Bitcoin network is one protocol of the 75% of blockchains that use Proof of Work (PoW) mining power to reach consensus.\n\nWith consensus on the Cardano blockchain through Ouroboros estimated to be over four-million times more energy-efficient than the Bitcoin protocol - let's use the tools available to us today to help build a sustainable world.\n\nIn a world where Cardano exists, maybe we don't have to wish for these things to happen, we make them happen!\n\nEACH PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD FOR THIS CHALLENGE CAN REQUEST FUNDS AMOUNTING TO NO MORE THAN A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE.\n\nTHIS IS TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE A DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS :)\n\nGuiding Budget Rationale:\n\nBasic infrastructure costs\nDeveloper Training, Education and Tools\nCatalyst Proposer Onboarding\nTranslation and Outreach\nAnd more…\n\n \n\nFor more information:\n\n* https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/\n\n* https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-launch-esd-2030-roadmap-africa-region\n\n* https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000374802\n\n* https://forum.cardano.org/t/world-computers-that-don-t-cost-the-earth/41259\n\n* https://forum.cardano.org/t/consensus-on-cardano-vs-other-blockchains/38738\n\n \n\nVideos on sustainability:\n\n- 1.

The challenge for fund 7 should be to take Catalyst to the streets by financing, at a 75% level (open to changes), various community proposed projects with a common goal. The original idea was that these outlets/businesses would have one thing in common: any sales made in ADA would come at a 10/15/20% discount. For example, a coffee or restaurant which sells a coffee at 1$ would sell it at 0.85$ (15% discount) if paid in ADA.  However, proposers could come up with other creative ways to incentivise and facilitate adoption of ADA through their projects.\n\nThe idea of this new challenge is to fund at a 75% aid intensity proposed projects which incentivise adoption of Cardano. This challenge would involve inactive people already present within Catalyst since it opens up Catalyst for anybody who wants to start his/her own business. The reason for not fully funding the project is that one would want some accountability by the proposer. \n\n \n\nRefund Process\n\n2/5% of all sales generated (depending on the operating margin of the business) is to be sent back to the treasury (or a separate treasury specifically for the challenge). On a base case, I would expect that investment is fully returned after 5 years time. However, evaluation of projects is crucial and must be strictly conducted. \n\n \n\nSpreading adoption / Avoiding Concentration of projects\n\nI would suggest that such fund be divided in countries where only 1 project per country can be awarded per fund. There can be a bonus project with double the fund allocation to allow for market penetration in acclaimed areas where rent costs (amongst others) would be much higher. This project is giving incentives to people to join the Cardano ecosystem by providing them with financial motivation to have their project funded. Secondly, once a funded project is up and running, customers of this project's business would have a reason why they should hold at least in a small portion, some ADA currency. The reason being to have a discount for their purchases.\n\nThe business must clearly advertise the 'discount' and in case where there are sales persons or cashier's they must clearly tell each customer that there is a discount for those paying with ADA.\n\nAlso, there must be a sign where it says \"Funded by Project Catalyst (Cardano)\". \n\n \n\nE-commerce portals\n\nThis is also very easily done on websites with an online payment option, where a discount is shown to apply if you chose the 'pay with ADA' option. \n\n \n\nEvaluating a proposal\n\nA business plan with clear revenue and profit forecasts must be put forward. Rationale of how one arrived to the figures must be clear and expenses must be substantiated by evidence where possible. Community advisors should have a background in finance or be successful entrepreneurs themselves. Ideally a scoring sheet is agreed one, a project would at least need 50% to be considered and then stars allocated accordingly to scoring.\n\nDiversification from competitors:\n\nThe idea is to incentivise people to set-up a wallet and purchase ADA. Projects which are diverse from the competition should be preferred. So we are talking about product differentiation, price competition, innovative products. \n\nLocation:\n\nObviously, highly frequented locations would be preferred since they would have the greatest potential since they would reach much more people.\n\nGrant requested:\n\nThe higher the grant requested the lower the score. This would automatically balance other evaluation criteria (eg. location) and the right balance between exposure (for proposals in densely populated areas and popular neighborhoods) and cost of investment (proposals in popular neighborhoods would naturally require a higher investment).\n\nTime of completion:\n\nThe lower the time of completion of the proposal, the higher the score. We want proposals to be set-up in a short time to start making an effect as fast as possible. A maximum limit of time (eg. 1.5 years) should be also put in place.\n\nReadiness of proposer:\n\nThe readier and the more prepared a prospective entrepreneur is, the better. Does the propose already have a lease contract in hand? Has the proposer contacted and acquired quotations for work needed? Has contact with suppliers been established? Has and marketing study been undertaken to identify the need for the business (especially in case of innovative ideas or niche markets) ?\n\nCapability and experience of entrepreneur:\n\nIs the entrepreneur knowledgeable in the proposed business venture? Has the proposer owned or does he/she still own similar businesses or any business at all? \n\nBranding and Copyright:\n\nThis has not been tackled yet and ideally a brand would be set up by IOHK with free licensing to the selected projects or even external investors upon review of their project. This licence could also be used to set an agreement for the 2/5% revenue ´fee´ (which then the treasury should hold the licensing rights). It would be very powerful for Cardano to build an empire of \"Cafè ADA\" around the globe. How could it be ignored? Or even have the 'ADA journal' or 'Cardano Times' with its newsroom. As long as the projects are profitable, the treasury will grow exponentially and in 10 years any project would be practically possible. \n\n \n\nAuditability\n\nHow do you know that the proposer is respecting the terms of the grant?\n\nFirst of all, when issuing the grant, it has to be done upon presentation of invoices, proof of payment and evidence of work done. Community advisors can do this, or a separate committee appointed.\n\nSecondly, the way payments in ADA are to be effected would be though a QR code displayed on the cashier counter. The code would hold the business wallet address. This should be a function which will become present in wallets.\n\nNow, how does one ensure that these guidelines are being followed ? One should first rely on the community to flag irregularities.  As the community is quite large and continues to grow, it should be enough to regulate or check these businesses (simply by visiting these places). Secondly, especially at the start of the challenge, a set of mystery shoppers can be tasked to visit certain place at a certain frequency to ensure that the project is reaching its goals. One would simply have people shop at these businesses and report back. Mystery shopper should be paid say 50$ in ADA for each visit. \n\n \n\nHow does the business make a profit if it has lower margins than the discount offered?\n\nThe discount given to ADA payers would be essentially written off against the rest of the sales. Furthermore, most businesses like supermarkets, coffee shops and bars have higher profit margins than 20%. Besides the margin, one has to consider the fixed costs including rent, wages, water and electricity and more. However, once the business scales there will be enough sales to cater for these expenses. Problems could arise if the ADA sales represent a sizable portion of total sales. This is highly unlikely especially at the early stages, nonetheless, in this case the discounts can be scaled down proportionally with the increase in ADA paid sales.\n\n \n\nReporting back to Catalyst:\n\nIt is important that the proposal winners submit monthly reports on the Sales made in ADA as compared to other sales (cash or card). Reporting should include, Sales value in ADA vs Total Sales Value, Number of sales in ADA vs Total number of sales, Sales made to Community Wallets (from anonymous wallet register to rewards voters, CAs and VCAs), Payments received from New Wallets (not as accurate since people can have different wallet addresses but still useful) and Repetitive sales to known wallets. Reports shall be strictly confidential and to issue data in percentage terms or absolute numbers.\n\n \n\nProblems solved\n\n1)Community engagement:\n\nThis has often been limited to developers as many people lack knowledge and skills to even put forward a proposal. This challenge opens the gates to literally anybody who is willing to open a business.\n\n2)Cardano Exposure:\n\nMany proposals talk about marketing and advertisements. Well, what better advertisement that to have a coffe shop named \"Cafè ADA\" or \"Cafe Cardano\" in the middle of a busy street which offer large discount for crypto payments. And through the community already existing in Cardano, we can have at least 10 places in various countries open at each Fund round, increasing at an exponential rate through revenue generation of the fund itself.\n\n3)Incentivise and Retain Community advisors and voters:\n\nOutlets themselves can offer increased discounts to Community Advisors and Voters (a wallet register would be set-up - identity can still be kept anonymous) thereby incentivising participation of both advisors and voters. This can be linked with an eventual honour/tier system which has been proposed for the advisors and voters based on their output.\n\n4)Attracting new Entrepreneurs to the Ecosystem:\n\nThese sort of grants would definitely attract the ear of various entrepreneurs who either do not have the funding or else do not want to take on the risk of opening their business. Naturally, the set-off would be that any project must incentivise the use or adoption of Cardano.\n\n5)Expand the network through actual use cases and incentives\n\nIncetivise the general public to become part of Cardano by offering them a reason to do it - purchase at a discounted rate. Aligning interests of the public of cost savings with those of Cardano.\n\n6) Sustainability; A Self-financing Challenge:\n\nIf all goes well, this challenge will be self sustaining and could also feed the treasury as a profit will eventually be made by the business and the treasury (be it the existing one or a separate one) will continue to benefit.\n\n \n\nAttachment: Actual figures from existing coffee shop\n\nPlease find attached the figure of an actual coffee shop who is not very popular, an average coffee shop (max capacity 40 persons), operates at some 50% capacity during weekdays and maybe 75% on weekends. The figures have been exchanged from Euro to Dollars. A projection for proposals has been extracted which assumes that there are 10% of total sales made in ADA and that such sales have a 15% discount. Furthermore, a 5% refund to Catalyst has been added. This shows that it is quite doable and that projects are basically refunded after 4-5 years assuming a 100k investment. I myself am a financial advisor (warranted accountant and auditor) dealing with start-ups and creating realistic business plans (often to determine amount of funding required from banks). As part of my job, I also help businesses apply for a number of EU grants and local government funding which adhere to very strict regulations and checks.\n\n \n\nExisting businesses\n\nA fund can be set-up to incentivise existing businesses to introduce crypto payments and offer discounts for ADA payments. This would also apply for those already offering ADA payment options, these would then have to introduce applicable discounts. This can be seen as a marketing fund where monthly payments (say $500/m) can be sent out to each business which is chosen. Ideally, for auditability purposes, e-commerce business should be given priority since these can easily be verified just by accessing their website.\n\nFunding\n\nAssuming a 100,000 grant which would mean an investment of 100,000/0.75=133,333 , a 1,000,000 allocation could finance 10 businesses every funding round or 9 businesses if the double financing project is added. This is a good starting point.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThank you for taking the time to read.

With this challenge, our community can provide funding for those on the ground to build upon their awareness of the Cardano protocol. Doing so will allow blockchain solutions for African problems to come from Africans.\n\nWithin our community we have some outstanding people in Africa that I've met who are working with us to grow the ecosystem. Yet infrastructure and funding to enable them to work more easily with one another is still lacking. Let's give our fellow community members a funding category they can point to within their local communities as a means to take part in this revolution of technology. In doing so we will be enabling our ecosystem to make improvements within African communities.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally funds communities in every region to build out our network in a more geographically decentralized manner.\n\nAddressing these issues in Africa and other parts of the world directly through funding challenges such as this gives them access to our community and our resources,  and thereby a means of support as they engage with the Cardano ecosystem and work to empower their neighbors in taking advantage of this powerful technology.\n\n \n\nI'd like to be clear that there is no attempt on my part here to earn any reward for this proposal. I do not believe it needs a team for autonomous people to be able to make proposals that help people from this region to take part in the Cardano ecosystem. Teams will continue to form organically, as they have been for the past year.\n\nI trust the community to make constructive comments and I trust the gradually improving assessment process to weed out charlatans.\n\nThe amount of funding I am proposing equals 6.25 % of the total available for Fund 7.

This makes Japan a likely country to adopt solutions built on top of Cardano. There are already some active community members and SPO's but participation in Catalyst is still relatively low. \n\nRecently an Eastern Town Hall was started by community members and participation in the Japanese breakout room has been among the highest consistently. In the fund 6 challenges there are several proposals coming from the Japanese community as well. With the current momentum a challenge in fund 7 would likely see good participation and can solidify the community.\n\n \n\nAt the moment most of Ideascale & Catalyst operates in english. This creates a barrier for all non-english communities. If solutions from this challenge prove successful in bridging that gap, they can function as an example for other communities.\n\n--\n\nChallenge Brief\n\nThe goal of this challenge is to find ways to further engage the Japanese community and to help create ways for the Japanese and English speaking community to connect. Proposers are encouraged to propose in Japanese and the Challenge team will help promote the CA role in the Eastern Town hall or equivalent event.\n\nThe budget is set to 50k because the Challenge focuses only on a specific part of the community. There are also projects from Japan which have a broad application and will fit in other challenges. Considering the focus is on community building the budget should be enough to support 2-6 meaningful efforts.\n\n \n\nPossible directions:\n\n-Translating key documentation\n\n-Creating educational content about Cardano & Catalyst in Japanese\n\n-Organising interpreters for Catalyst events\n\n-Organising workshops for new members, CA's, SPO's, proposers\n\n-Setting up community hubs\n\n \n\nChallenge Team\n\nThe Challenge team consists of two active members from the Japanese community and one member from the general community. Among them there is experience with proposing & facilitating. The challenge team members have previously helped with the organising both Eastern Town Hall (Japan Breakout) and After Town Hall sessions\n\n \n\n日本人のカタリスト参加は重要であり、どうやって日本人のカタリスト参加率を向上させるかは、大きな課題です。\n\nカルダノは日本から開始され、多くのアーリーアダプター（プレセールホルダー）が存在しますが、そのADA保有率に比べて、カタリスト参加率が低いのが現状です。\n\n成功目標\n\nこのため、「日本語による」積極的な日本のカタリスト関連のコミュニティへの働きかけを実施し、日本と他国のコミュニティ間の交流を活発化します。\n\n主な達成目標\n\n日本人のカタリスト系イベントへの積極的な参加（タウンホールミーティング、Ideascale　など）\n\nカタリストイベントにおける日本語―英語のコミュニケーションの通訳者\n\n日本語で記述された提案に対する正しい評価の数（評価者からの交流）\n\nなぜ、これが重要か？\n\n日本では当初からカルダノに関心があり、ブロックチェーン技術に対する進歩的な姿勢も示してきました。このため、日本はカルダノのが提供する様々なソリューション（Dapps, Defi, Eco-System）を採用する可能性は高いといえます。すでに精力的な活動をするコミュニティメンバーとSPOは存在しますがいますが、Catalystへの参加はホルダー数に比べてまだまだ少ないです。\n\n最近開始された、東半球タウンホールミーティングにおいて、日本ルーム（ブレイクアウトルーム）の参加人数は、ミーティングにおいて最大級の一つであり、日本人の活発な参加がみられます。Fund6においても、日本のコミュニティからの提案は、いくつもあり、増加傾向です。このままいけば、Fund7では、さらに活発な提案が実施され、コミュニティの継続的なカタリスト提案への参加が期待できます。\n\nしかし、Ideascaleおよびカタリストの大半は、英語での操作やコミュニケーションが必要です。翻訳機能もありますが、この言語の壁は、非英語圏の人の参入障壁となってしまっています。もし、このチャレンジが、この言語の壁を解消することができるなら、日本語以外の言語圏とのコミュニティと英語コミュニティとの連携の良い例となるでしょう。\n\nChallenge Brief\n\nこの課題のゴールとして、\n\n日本コミュニティのさらなるカタリストへの参加、活発化を促し、日本語と英語という異なる言語のコミュニティが、言語の壁を越えてつながる提案を支援することです。提案者が提案を日本語で記述することを奨励し、チャレンジチームは東部タウンホールまたは同等のイベントでのアドバイザーの役割を強化し、日本人が抵抗なくカタリストに参加することを促進します。\n\nチャレンジ予算は$50000として設定します。少なく見えるとは思いますが、一つのコミュニティに集中するためです。幅広い用途があり、日本からも日本人の提案を支援するプロジェクトもあります。今回の提案では、コミュニティの構築に焦点を当てており、予算は2〜6個くらいの効果的な提案をサポートするには十分な予算と考えています。\n\n実際の活動例としては、\n\n重要な文書の翻訳\n\nカルダノとカタリストの日本語による教育コンテンツの作成\n\nカタリストイベントにおける通訳者の組織\n\n新しいアドバイザー・ステークプールオペレータ・提案者に対するワークショップ開催\n\nコミュニティーハブ（コミュニティー同士の連携の場）をセッティング\n\nChallenge Team\n\n我々のチームでは、公式チームからのメンバーと、日本コミュニティ出身の活動的なメンバー（Issa, ranket）を加えて、チャレンジを推進します。彼らは、提案経験とコミュニティのプロモ―ティング経験を有しています。そして、チャレンジメンバーは、すでにカタリスト東半球タウンホールミーティングにおける日本ブレイクアウトルームの開催および開催後の議論のサポートを開始しています。\n\nチャールズ氏も海外コミュニティも、日本人のカタリスト参加はカルダノ発展に重要であると考えています。\n\n是非、日本人の独りよがりと思わずに、カタリストに参加を！そして、その参加をする本プロジェクトへの投票をお願いします。","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369705-48088"},{"content":"Challenge brief\n\nClimate Change is humanities greatest challenge going forward.\n\nWE NEED EVERYONE TO TAKE ACTION. \n\nWE ARE WHO WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.\n\nCardano and its community should be at the forefront of providing solutions.\n\nThe Project Catalyst platform is where the community could generate and support bright ideas to face climate change, make a direct impact and start a ripple effect.

Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.\n\nIn this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\n\nCardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.\n\nWith Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.\n\nThe DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users' needs.\n\nIt has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains\n\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix\n\nCardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.\n\nPrivacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming).

Even ensuring a good score is difficult to get engagement in the voting stage to compete with consolidated and influential teams in the Cardano community.\n\nThis challenge intends to sow new teams, who have never received funding from Catalyst so they can have a chance to show their value to the community.\n\n \n\nEach new team can request up to 25% of the total $200,000 USD budget, also know as $50,000 USD.\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $25,000 USD\nTeam B with 5 proposals of $10,000 USD\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $50,000 USD\nTeam D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $35,000 US\n\n \n\nThe 200,000 USD budget has been set so that it can accommodate the demand seen in previous Funds for DeFi-related proposals in the \"Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. It is also important to take into account that DeFi dApps sometimes require more experienced developers due to the nature of DeFi dapps requiring high levels of guarantee, after all they are mission critical applications and the smart contracts of these dApps will guarantee the safety of users and large amounts Of money.\n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\nIn the image below(see atachments) it is possible to see several dapp projects related to DeFi that are being developed on Cardano's blockchain (DEXs, Lending+Borrowing, Stable Coins, Synthetic Assets, Oracles, Derivatives and Insurance)","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369764-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369785-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369789-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369793-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369805-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369806-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369807-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369809-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369823-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369825-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369835-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369839-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369846-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369864-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369878-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369893-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369894-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369901-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369923-48088"},{"content":"\n\nChallenge brief\n\n\n- Doing a test in a small area like Sicily will help us to better understand if the project can be extended to other areas of the world.\nWith the economy accumulated by the first agricultural farm, it is possible to finance other farms.

This can include any method that will offer users or entities a decentralized ID to start defining their digital self-sovereignty. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.\n\nWe are a community of thought leaders and it is time to demonstrate our thoughts with actions. Using a Decentralized Identification (DID) technology to establish self-sovereign presence and ownership of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) advances decentralization of institutions; benefiting individuals and entities.\n\nThis Challenge is about small ways we can incorporate DIDs into the Cardano ecosystem to start the ground swell at the grassroots that demands PII be secured and controlled with DID technologies and standards.\n\nIt is about signaling to the world that the Cardano community plans mass-adoption of DID that is interchangeable, interoperable (by W3C DID standards) and we care deeply that the origin of our personal DID is tied to our home blockchain—Cardano.\n\nWhile we prefer to support Atala PRISM's instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since Atala PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.\n\nProposers will have the opportunity to join the upcoming Atala PRISM pioneer program where they can learn about the Atala PRISM SDKs and get access to documentation. Get a head start on building identity solutions or integrating identity into your Cardano dApps via a highly interactive training and certification program.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370124-48088"},{"content":"\n\nChallenge brief\n\n\nTBD\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370132-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370141-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370142-48088"},{"content":"\n\nMedia (YouTube link)\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/370145-48088"},{"content":"\n\nChallenge brief\n\n\nCardano has ambitious plans to reach 1 billion people.
