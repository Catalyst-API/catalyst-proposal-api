The dApps usually store data on IPFS and record the immutable hash of this data on the blockchain.\n\n \n\nIPFS might be an odd concept at first, we recommend spending some time reading their excellent documentation to learn more. https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/.\n\n \n\n## Where is this data really stored?\nThat is the problem we are trying to solve. This data is usually stored on different nodes, but over time, if the data is not being accessed, it is pruned from the network. To prevent this, there is a concept of data \"pinning\", which allows you to save this data on your server and prevent its deletion over time.\n\n \n\n## Where does Blockfrost.io come in all of this?\nAt Blockfrost.io, we provide IPFS support to developers. However, we realized that preserving the data early on is important for the future generations and the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n \n\nSince day one, we started pinning all IPFS data posted on the Cardano ecosystem as a community service. So, if you as a developer ever use IPFS on Cardano, we will keep your data from ever disappearing.\n\n \n\nAt the moment of writing this proposal, we are storing over 65,000 (!) different IPFS files from the community, which generates over 5TB of traffic per week by more than 90 000 unique visitors. We anticipate this number to grow, and would like to ask the community to participate in this service.\n\n \n\n## Deliverables and budget\nWe would like to ask for funding of for a virtual servers Europe, Asia, Americas and Australia.\n\n \n\nWe predict the associated cost for this year is $320 per server, which totals to $1 280 a month for servers and $200 monthly subscription for CDN, resulting in $1 680 monthly.\n\n \n\nWe ask the funding to cover the infrastructure cost only. The team at Blockfrost.io will provide their time keeping it up and running as a service to this incredible community.\n\n \n\nThe funds will be gradually dispensed on a monthly basis as we deliver the service, and the cost proofs (invoices) will be shared with the Catalyst team if requested.\n\n \n\nWe will build the clustered services within 10 days of receiving the funding. We aim for a 99% of cluster SLA that we will consider a success. We predict to have 1M+ unique visitors monthly by the 3 months of deploying the service. We are asking for a half-year of funding and will provide uptime metrics to the community. We hope to extend the funding in the future if the community is happy with our performance.\n\n \n\n## Relevant experience\nFive Binaries is an infrastructure development company.

So far as we know, no one even attempts to automatically verify these particular important properties, because they fail to consider the adversarial relationship between participants as a fundamental feature of their formal models, often because their formal models are too low-level. This will be a premier feat, that will confirm Cardano as funding the bleeding edge of blockchain technology.\nIntroduction\nContext\nMuKn launched our Glow DSL for DApp development on Cardano's Mantis-EVM side-chain. This project was funded by IOHK and will benefit Cardano in the long run by bringing DApp users and developers to it. IOHK continues to fund front- and back-end development of Glow, but in order for Glow to maximally benefit Cardano, lots of work remains to be done.\nOne problem that keeps developers from building DApps is the risk of catastrophic bugs. MuKn's Glow language was designed to help overcome this problem by automatically proving the mathematical correctness of every interaction of a program (both user-to-user and user-to-blockchain).\nMuKn now has the manpower to implement this formal verification architecture, and can begin building out these features as soon as they are funded.\nThus, with the generous assistance of the Catalyst Fund, MuKn would like to build formal verification into our Glow DSL. With this technology, users will be able to verify that DApps built with Glow are indeed safe before they start using those DApps. Importantly, developers will also be able to detect that some of their DApps are currently incorrect and must be fixed, before those DApps are launched and lose their users' assets.\nFormal verification for Glow DApps\nWe designed Glow so that DApps written in it can automatically prove their correctness with respect to three classes of properties:\n\nSystem invariants: The DApp always keeps all inputs and outputs balanced at all times, never involving negative amounts, and never leaving assets unaccounted for.\nAdversarial Safety: It is an optimal strategy for each participant to follow the protocol. No participant may gain an advantage by straying, defecting, or trying to cheat—they may only timeout and lose their collateral. Meanwhile, no matter how badly the other participants behave or fail to behave, participants who do follow the protocol may collect that forfeited collateral, and are otherwise guaranteed not to lose anything beyond the bounded transaction fees.. These properties establish the safety of the interaction, on the assumption that each participant has a suitable initial valuation of each asset, and that volatility remains within their predicted range.\nUser-defined: Any DApp-dependent user-defined invariant is specified in a suitable modal logic that covers the relevant aspects of concurrent temporal logic, epistemic logic, linear logic, game semantics, and game theory. For instance, a zero-sum gamble may include an invariant according to which neither participant has a winning strategy, and that given suitable convex respective utility functions, both participants may a priori gain in participating. A derivatives product might include an invariant according to which, within some suitable economic and technical hypotheses, the strike price enforced by the contract will remain close enough to some formula valid outside the contract.\nMuKn broadly understands how to implement this formal verification: we first wrote the theory of it, and our previous prototype automatically verified some of these properties. Unhappily, that codebase has grown stale and no longer matches the current version of Glow.\nThe goal of this project would be to implement a new formal verification tool that closely matches the current version of Glow and can be easily amended as Glow itself is extended. Emphasis will be given to the adversarial safety properties, since they are what guarantee the safety of a DApp in an adversarial environment, and are not studied by any of our competitors.\nWe believe that it is important that our tool can automatically prove that various \"obvious\" implementations of a protocol are wrong: for instance, that publishing bets or bids without a commit-reveal protocol in some interactions allows the last person who publishes their data to game the results. Or that omitting some verifications allow some users to cheat. It is not enough to say \"yes\" to a complete program, the tool must say \"no\" to most incomplete or incorrect programs.\nNo amount of language safety can remove the necessity of having DApp audited by proficient experts. But careful language design and tool automation can greatly improve both the cost and quality of these audits, by making subtle bugs and underhanded code very hard to write, so that auditors can focus on the intent of the DApp and its higher-level, more obvious, issues.\nBudget and Deliverables\nUpdating Glow to reimplement these formal verification methods will require funding a full-time research engineer, and enough management overhead to oversee their work. We believe a qualified hire will cost approximately $15k per month, plus another $7.5k per month for two months to create the necessary management overhead and support, including having the compiler team refactor their code to accommodate the needs of formal verification.\n**With a funding of $60,000, we believe we can deliver a minimal proof of concept, limited to handling demo cases, within 3 months. Assuming continued funding, we believe we could have functional formal verification of Glow within 6 months, and complete, externally audited formal verification of the Glow stack within 12 months to verify that no invalid operation is possible, and no valid operation is rendered impossible.\n\n \nWe believe we can launch functional formal verification of Glow by December 2021.**\nThe Glow Language\nGlow is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Decentralized Applications (DApps). It is developed as an Open Source product by Mutual Knowledge Systems, aka MuKn (pronounced \"Moon\"). Compared to competing DApp languages, Glow provides much higher-level abstractions that make DApp development drastically simpler and faster, but also portable and amenable to formal verification. With Glow, DApps will be much cheaper and faster to develop and to use, but also, importantly, to audit and to trust.\nIn Glow, a DApp is an interaction between two or more participants who do not trust each other, exchanging digital assets on decentralized ledgers, using a \"smart contract\" to automatically enforce the rules of the interaction.\nImportantly, a Glow program includes simple annotations about which participant may or must take what actions at each step of the interaction. These restrictions are enforced by the language itself, and it isn't possible for developers to unwittingly omit or reverse a permission check, which already eliminates a vast class of problems with DApps written in Solidity.\nWhile a DApp interaction involves a smart contract, it also importantly involves code that runs \"off-chain\" on each of the mutually distrusting participants' machines. The more work is off-loaded off-chain, the cheaper the DApp can be, but the harder it is to assess that the contract still holds the participants mutually accountable. Glow generates not just a \"smart contract\", but also client code that will run on the local machines of participants for each role involved in the interaction. This ensures that there is never a discrepancy between the contract and the client code.\nThe above features eliminate a large class of issues, and an order of magnitude in the effort required to build a DApp, but also to audit it, compared to developing in Solidity and JavaScript. Developing in Glow is still a factor two times simpler than developing in Plutus and Haskell. And unlike either of the above approaches, it is potentially portable to all blockchains with smart contracts. Glow thus offers the promise of a blockchain ecosystem where DApp functionality is not tied to any single blockchain. In such an ecosystem, technically superior blockchains, like Cardano, will win.\nFinally, Glow is designed around a logical model that abstracts at a much higher level than other DApp languages, which enables it to automatically handle the chaining of sequences of transactions by alternative users, with timeouts and loss of collateral for users who fail to act within contractually mandated time limits. In the near future, Glow will be able to automatically insert the escrow of sufficient collateral to align the interests of all parties toward cooperating to the completion of the interaction into any DApp. Glow currently emits code in \"direct style\" that closely matches the style in which humans write DApps today; but soon it will also be able to emit code in \"generalized state channel style\", that allows for scalable private contracts. The complexity of implementing this style correctly by hand makes it critical that the Glow compiler generates not just the \"smart contract\" for a DApp, but also matching client and server code.\nGlow has already been launched on Cardano's Mantis EVM side-chain, and is currently funded by IOHK to develop a new UI, more supported smart contracts, and a compiler.\nMuKn\nWe at MuKn (or more formally, Mutual Knowledge Systems, Inc.) envision a world where everyone uses blockchains for commercial and financial transactions. In this world, simple auditable DApps maximize how much users can trust the system while minimizing how much they need to trust other users. And our Glow language helps make DApps orders of magnitude simpler and more auditable.\nFrançois-René Rideau: Co-Founder, has been making programming languages and distributed systems usable for 25 years.

Usually, when your application requires a remote API, a socket connection opened from your application sends an HTTP request to the API endpoint you want to reach.

On the WebSocket, the API can send new information to the application as well as the other way around (full-duplex).\n\n \n\nThe support for WebSockets is missing in most of the Cardano ecosystem APIs. We only know of the Ogmios project that does provide this support, but it is communicating with Cardano-node protocols. However, WebSocket are crucial for the unhindered scaling of classic web applications that use Cardano as a backend.\n\n \n\n## Roadmap, deliverables and performance\nThe bridge itself will connect to the Blockfrost API on the backend and provide a new API endpoint with WebSockets support.\nWe plan to deliver the first stable version of the bridge no later than 3 months since the funding. We define success as having at least one major (100+ users) implementation of this bridge by half a year after the funding. Long term success is if the project is maintained and used after 12 months after the funding.\n\nThe first version will mainly target lightweight wallet-like application that requires constant monitoring of the Cardano network, for example for incoming transactions or fees changes to a staking pool.

(https://research.aimultiple.com/low-code-statistics/)\nTo achieve a truly exponential growth in number of developers, Cardano needs to take advantage of this no-code/low-code movement to allow anyone (so called citizen developers), not just experienced software engineers, to build end-to-end apps that connect to Cardano smart contracts.\nWhile Marlowe with Blocky will allow Cardano developers to create contracts with no coding experience, this will not be enough as an enterprise application consists of many more connecting parts.\n\n \n\nAbout us\nWe are building flycode, the most complete no-code platform and, while being long time Cardano fans, we think it might be the perfect way for our product to tackle blockchain integration, while also benefiting Cardano by combining our powerful no-code enterprise app creation tools with the Blocky extension of Marlowe for a truly end-to-end no-code experience. This no-barrier way of building apps connected to the blockchain will be a competitive advantage for Cardano.\nWe plan to launch flycode.io towards the end of this year, and while being a comercial solution it will also have a free tier with enough features for most blockchain apps usage requirements. To be notified about our launch you can leave us your email on our website :)\n\n \n\nUse Cases\n An interesting example of an app that you will be able to build end-to-end with flycode would be a decentralised borrow and lending platform. In this use case the workflow would work like this:\n\nFirst create the neccesary smart contracts with Blocky and deploy them on Cardano\nThen create a beautiful user interface to display the vaults, and user actions, using our drag&drop app editor\nYou now would be able to use the Cardano blockchain connector to link the user data & actions in the interface with the smart contracts on the blockchain through a browser wallet\nYou could also create user dashboards with visual charts to display APY information or earning predictions\nLater in our roadmap, you will be able to use our AI&Data analysis tools to predict user actions or calculate earnings forecasts\nThe created app will be automatically hosted in the cloud and you will be able to publish updates\nYou could also take advantage of our other features that do not necessarily relate directly with the Cardano blockchain connector like: powerful database creation tools, automated workflows, the chat-bot creator and many more features that will roll our gradually in the next year.\n\nSchedule\n\n1st Phase - first month after receiving funds:\n\nDesign and plan the Cardano Blockchain Connector in accordance with the Cardano roadmap\nStart wire-framing and prototyping\n\n2nd Phase - second month after receiving funds, no more than 3 months prior to our release (subject to change depending on Cardano releases)\n\n1st & 2nd month - Develop the first MVP of the Connector\n3rd month - Test and refine the Connector \n \n\n3rd Phase - Release and maintenance - Launch planned for December 16th 2021, private beta bill be available earlier\n\n \n\nBudget\n\n*The presented budget only refers to the Cardano Blockchain Connector module of our no-code solution\n\n1st Phase\n\nDesign&Plan - $3600 (40 man hours * $45 hourly rate)\n\n2st Phase\n\nDeveloping - $14400 (2 full-time dev months * $45 hourly rate)\nTesting&Refining - $3800 (40 dev hours * $45 hourly rate + 80 tester hours * $25 hourly rate )\n\n3rd Phase\n\nCloud Servers - $3600 (3 bare-metal servers * $100/month * 12 months average - to accommodate the free tier for the Cardano Blockchain apps, after the first year we will support these costs ourselves)\n\nKey Objectives and Definition of Success\n\nIn the first 3 months we plan to gain popularity amongst blockchain developers / no-code enthusiasts and have at least 10 applications developed on our platform using the Cardano Blockchain Connector\nAfter 6 months we expect 30 Cardano apps, which will serve as success stories to attract new developers to start developing on Cardano using no code.\nWe expect at least 100 Cardano apps up and running in the first 12 months after release\n\n \n\n*If you're a blockchain enthusiast / developer / UI/UX Designer, you like our idea and you're interested in a collaboration please send me you're CV/portfolio at the contact information found on my GitHub account: https://github.com/MarianFilipovici\n\n \n\nThank you for considering our idea :)\n\n.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352756-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352747-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352730-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352623-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n############################\n\n## Why Cardanoscan for the testnet?\n\nWe have been approached by many developers asking for a testnet version of the Cardanoscan explorer. Cardanoscan has features to query tokens, policies, stake keys, stake key mapped addresses, pool updates, insights into all types of certificates, including the voting rewards. The list is big with so many tiny and unique features.\nWhile developing on Cardano, developers always need to test their implementations on an iterative basis, Cardanoscan can show their transactions with every detail mentioned above, which will help them speed up the development process. Currently, developers are required to use CLI and other manually managed tools to verify and look into transactions. These tools are cumbersome to use and add additional time to their development cycle and delay their deliverables.\n\n \n\nAlso, we are open sourcing our in-house developed networking library for the developer community via our fund-4 proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Ouroboros-Networking-Lib-in-JS/342248-48088)\n\n \n\n## Who are we?\n\nI'm the creator of Cardanoscan - Cardano Explorer. You can find me on Twitter @ashisherc\n\n \n\n## Why are we asking for funding to run a testnet explorer\n\nRunning and maintaining an explorer requires time and infrastructure cost. Maintaining yet another version of the explorer requires a new isolated server setup and maintenance. The testnet environment is meant for testing new stuff and things are expected to break, which adds additional maintenance time for the team.\n\n \n\n# Success of this proposal\n\nWhile running an explorer is always an ongoing activity, we would like to ask for funds to support this initiative for the next 6 months. We will try to monetize the testnet explorer in a better way that the testnet explorer can self-sustain on its own in the future. We can also plan to put a new proposal after 6 months for the renewal of this project.\n\n \n\n# Launch Date & Timeline\n\nThe deployment should be completed in about 2 weeks after the date of the funds approved for this proposal.\n\n \n\n## Budget\n\nThe cost of running the explorer for the testnet is detailed as below,\n--------\nThe monthly cost breakdown,\n\nMaintainance Cost as Developer Salary -> 400 USD\nServer and infrastructure cost -> 700 USD\nTotal Monthly Cost -> 1100 USD\n--------\nWe are asking for a budget of 6 months,\nMonthly Cost x 6 -> 6600 USD\nOne time setup cost -> 900 USD\nTotal Funds Requested - 7500 USD","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352606-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nAt Gimbalabs, we are pioneering the work of onboarding \"experienced developers who are new to blockchain\" to the Cardano ecosystem. In the last three months, we:\n\nreleased open source tools like Dandelion APIs and LIFT Wallet to support devs to build on & tinker with Cardano\ncreated education materials like Coding on Chain and Cardano Starter Kits for devs to learn what's possible on Cardano\npiloted live, project-based learning experiences where devs who are new to blockchain can work together to wrap their minds around the new implications of building on distributed and decentralized platforms\nfostered opportunities for new and experienced developers to collaborate on real projects\nsupported dozens of projects within Catalyst and beyond to start to bring their ideas to life\n\n \n\n \n\nAll of this we've done by asking developers to volunteer their time and energy in hopes of an eventual payoff. With this proposal, we seek the approval of the Catalyst Community to launch the next phase of our work by supporting four developers to commit full-time to Cardano development at the dawn of the Alonzo era.\n---\nThis proposal addresses the Developer Ecosystem Challenge from two angles:\n\nGrowing expertise: we will directly increase the number of developers actively building on Cardano. In our work already, we are onboarding talented developers who want to understand more about blockchain in general, and Cardano in particular. We've worked hard already to \"show\" these devs how building on blockchain is different: what old rules still apply, and which are thrown out the window. For example, what is the role of a centralized database in a decentralized app? How can we handle user authentication using metadata and/or decentralized identity?\nCreating tools and documentation for developers: in addition to the developers we train directly, we will create tools and documentation so that others can engage more deeply and build on Cardano. We are focused on primitive components that can applied to many use cases: authentication, storage, digital rights management, tokens with real utility like event tickets, proofs of donation, and more. This is not an exhaustive list, just a sampling of what we've been working on. As we continue to build these tools we will release documentation and learning resources so that additional devs can build specific use cases.\n\n \n\n \n\n---\nWhat is challenging about this work is that each of our concerns depends on another:\n\nIn order to build end use cases, we need to have new tooling and people who understand those tools.\nIn order to understand what tooling we need, we must have end use cases in mind and people who understand the design problems we're solving.\nIn order to build dapps and tooling, we need people who are not only technically savvy, but also deeply understand the system of big ideas, technical and otherwise, underlying Cardano's implementation.\nIn order to attract these developers, we need to be able to provide clarity about what they're building in the first place, even as the Cardano platform continues to roll out.\n\n \n\nOn top of this dynamic array of concerns, we recognize that talented developers are valuable and command high salaries wherever they choose to go. We already have the experience of onboarding two very talented developers who have been unable to stick around because they need the assurance the new full-time jobs they were offered while working with us. That's why we're writing this proposal. 100% of the budget of this proposal is for developers, and represents an investment in the long-term health of Gimbalabs and the Cardano developer community.\n---\nOnce Catalyst Funds are distributed, the \"Execution Phase\" begins. Catalyst Fund 5 is special because when the execution phase starts in late June, the Plutus Testnet will be in full swing, and Cardano's Alonzo era will be weeks away. It is hard to overstate how much work is coming our way as the full functionality of Cardano goes online, and our global community needs more people who are prepared to do it. Our goal is to have a team in place before that happens, and we think that it's essential to build that team by growing the overall pool of Cardano developers.\nPlan:\n\nUse the funds for this proposal to pay four developers a full-time salary for three months of full-time work\nDevs will focus on creating well-documented tools and example use cases so that more people can continue to learn what Cardano can do\nOur intention is for these developers to become leaders in Cardano blockchain development who can in turn support more devs to come aboard\n\n--- For Example ---\nIn the current work of the \"Gimbalabs Playground\", we are diving into a series of development questions. One such question is, \"How can we use metadata, native assets, smart contracts, and decentralized storage to create an event ticketing service?\" As you can imagine, there are all sorts of smaller, focused questions that emerge from this big one. In the shared work of answering it, we are creating tools that will apply to a variety of use cases, and we are piloting several of those use cases. Even more importantly, we are building a community of experts who will be able to support others to use these tools. If funded, this proposal will directly support the growth of expertise in our community. We will continue to deliver the tools, accompanying documentation, and in-person opportunities to engage with our development team.\n\n--- Summary ---\n\nWe will continue to build and refine the \"Gimbalabs Playground\" process for experiential, project-based learning into a product that will help organizations of all sizes to join us in the Alonzo era.\n\nThere's work to do, we have people to do it, and we'd like to pay them to do so. During the Refinement Phase, please let us know in the comments what else you'd want us to deliver, and we will incorporate that into these plans.\n\n \n\n--- Budget ---\n\nTotal of $100,000 USD\n$25,000 each for four developers to commit to 3 months of full-time development work.\n\n \n\n--- Success Metrics ---\n\n3 Months: All four developers are up to speed on how to build Dapps and tooling on Cardano, and have contributed to open source tooling and documentation.\n6 Months: Our initial work was engaging enough to keep these developers around and the resulting tools are being used by additional devs across the Cardano ecosystem\n12 Months: These \"first four\" developers are leading teams and continuing to onboard newcomers to the Cardano developer community. The tools they've created are being used in production Dapps worldwide.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352579-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352568-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n- Videos/Interviews Weekly\n- Free to Catalyst for 3 lunar cycles (business quarter)\n- Running workshops, learning tutorials and willing to apply a level-up mentoring structure/connect to relevent projects of interest\n- Working with Swarm, in the ecosystem and with developers\n- Seeking everyone!\n\n \n\nLooking to combine with existing proposals in the ecosystem - web-weaving\n\nSuccess after 3mo - self recursional flywheel effect, 6mo - 50% more mentors in the ecosystem 12 mo - self sustaining mentorship structure that builds and grows with swarm.\n\n \n\nTeam For Me – Crowdsourced remote teams to solve tough innovation challenges\n\nIndividual Project Catalyst members don't have enough time to find suitable team members and perfect their proposal simultaneously. The proposers are trying alone to push their half-baked ideas while Community Advisors' time is wasted rating incomplete proposals. Average proposal rating remains low. Work gets piled up: a handful of Community Advisors write the majority of reviews.\n\nTeam For Me is an online platform to create and prepare teams to solve innovation challenges. Funding is sought for Stage 1 of a three-stage development process (detailed below). The outcome will be a 4-person team ready to create a minimum viable product in the next stage.\n\nThe platform allows like-minded individuals with complementary skills and personalities to form a professional team – even before they know what they are going to work on together. They are trained to understand and to appreciate each other's differences. Diversity of personalities is the key. Each team will ideally have a fast-paced Driver to ensure things get done, a detail-oriented and analytical Problem Solver, an expressive Communicator to handle partnerships and marketing, as well as a caring Peacemaker to bring the team together and to guarantee a good working climate.\n\nDiverse teams that have had time to brainstorm and to learn to work well together are more ready for collaborative innovation and decision making. They can propose implementable solutions that can be funded more confidently, allowing Project Catalyst to emphasize quality over quantity.\n\nMINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP for Project Catalyst in 2021) — Proposers have good ideas but find it hard to compile a suitable team around them. Initial focus should not be on the ideas but on the teams that can generate better ideas together.\n\nThe developed MVP functions as the basis for a full-scale professional service offered for enterprises and nonprofits in 2022. This, in turn, could find employment for the teams formed within Project Catalyst.\n\nINITIAL REASONING FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE\n\nBased on years of theoretical and practical exploration, certain assumptions are made that guide the solution design at a later stage:\n\n- Recruitment is broken: Job openings call for superstars and miracle makers and, although all sorts of freelancers are readily available, one person hardly ever possesses all the qualifications needed. The costs of headhunting, on-boarding and team building are astronomical and the process wastes a lot of time, yet there is no guarantee of results.\n\n- Corporate problem solving: Adding individuals to existing innovation teams always results in down-time and confusion. An external self-managed team can approach the challenge with fresh eyes and get the job done quicker and better. Suggested solutions can benefit from but are not limited to Cardano.\n\n- Teams for Startups: Idea-rich entrepreneurs and inventors struggle to find the right team to take their products and services to the market. Startups are measured first by their people and timeliness of their solution – and only then by the plan, business concept and funding. Team For Me can be used to gather an implementation team around a single entrepreneur or inventor.\n\n- Human dignity is in danger: Rather than solving tough innovation challenges, freelancers and contractors are often used only for trivial micro-tasks and simple one-off projects. People are not just disposable cogs in the machine; they seek for autonomy, mastery and meaning in their work.\n\n- The promise and demise of remote teamwork: Connecting remote team members with each other and matching them with the right challenges benefits everyone involved. More often than not, however, virtual teams tend to fail unless they have a strong sense of purpose, understanding of each other's unique potential and a facilitator/mediator to guide them into high performance.\n\nTEAM MEMBER PROFILE\n\nTeam members can find each other and be matched together based on the diversity of their:\n\n- Personality\n\n- Background (video introduction)\n\n- Skills\n\n- Knowledge\n\n- Interests\n\n- Learning diary\n\n- (Later: tokenized reputation)\n\nTHE PROCESS IN A NUTSHELL:\n\nTeam For Me hand-picks enthusiastic doers with complementary skill-set and personalities.\n\nTeam gets to know each other virtually and decides if they'd like to work together.\n\nNecessary adjustments are made to guarantee the right fit. Team is formed.\n\nTeam picks a proposed innovation challenge and they start brainstorming solutions.\n\nTeam roles are decided and intimacy is built in a facilitated introductory meeting.\n\nTeam starts their work and they are guided through stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, performing (and adjourning). The solution takes shape.\n\nThe team documents their journey, utilizes available support materials and communicates openly to face challenges together.\n\nEach team member benefits from facilitated peer-to-peer feedback and goal-oriented development.\n\nOnce the team has solved their challenges they can either a) go different ways, b) accept another challenge to solve or c) come up with their own business idea to work on.\n\nEvery time someone leaves the team or someone joins, this change is facilitated to guarantee smooth transition and continued high performance.\n\nStage 1: PREPARATION (Fund5)\n\nAt first stage the deliverables are:\n\n- Team formation: 3 new people with complementary personalities, interests, skills and knowledge are required to tackle the next stage.\n\n- Research into possible partnerships and good case practices\n\n- Detailed process description and supporting materials for team formation\n\n- Detailed plan and budget for the MVP\n\n- Wireframe for Mobile & Desktop User Interface\n\n- Brand identity and marketing materials for internal promotion within Project Catalyst\n\nStage 2: MVP FOR PROJECT CATALYST (Fund7)\n\nIn the second stage the deliverables include but are not limited to:\n\n- Integration with other initiatives / solutions developed within Project Catalyst\n\n- Mobile and web UI: functioning online tools to run the team formation process\n\n- Proof of concept: testing with 3-5 teams, collecting feedback and incorporating changes\n\n- Fully developed marketing materials to start gauging external interest\n\nOnce the MVP is ready, we can invite participation by launching Team For Me internally to Project Catalyst members in e.g. Cardano Live and/or Town Hall meetings.\n\nStage 3: PROFESSIONAL SERVICE (2022)\n\nIn the third stage, if there is demand, the deliverables include:\n\n- Mobile and web UX ready to demo externally\n\n- Full business plan, budget and communication plan\n\n- 3-5 additional team members and/or partners to execute the plans\n\nTeams created in the MVP stage and other interested Project Catalyst members will take precedence when introducing potential solution teams to the enterprise clients.\n\nBUDGET\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cs94euPc8goLQfO0qbM_JFH0QtXMD9Q6JnLQkOqXMbY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe budget for Stage 1 includes an incentive worth $500 (of the budgeted ADA) for each of the three selected core team members and no other compensation is paid at this stage. The proposer's involvement is capped at $7,500 (in ADA). Stage 2 budget will be made according to the actual work plan and responsibilities within the team.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThere are established solutions like Toptal and Upwork Enterprise for finding, onboarding and remunerating freelancers. However, they are focusing on individuals, not teams. The closest competitors are X-team, a new initiative called Teamstack that, however, focuses mostly on teams for IT projects, not for wider innovation challenges. Freelancing Teams is a cool service but it assumes that the proposer already knows both the challenge and the solution. We will get in touch with some of the smaller players to see if there would be synergistic opportunities for collaboration.\n\nDISCONTINUED PROJECTS\n\nPrevious attempts have been discontinued for various reasons (usually it's just not the right time and environment or the approach has been too local or narrow). Startup Startup matched talent with startups based on personality and skills. CollabFinder allowed one to find cofounders, collaborators and other makers to help build a project. Elevator helped recruit teams. We will get in touch with all of these and, to avoid the same destiny, pick their brains to understand what went wrong.\n\nAVAILABLE DOMAINS\n\nTeamForMe.io\n\nTeamForMe.cc\n\n(Not registered yet because the team might suggest a better name.)\n\nABOUT THE PROPOSER\n\nTomi's an expert in innovation, diversity and team leadership.

The program is proposed by the Blockchain Education Network (BEN).\nEarn and Learn programs on Coinbaise and Coinmarketcap have shown potential as a fun and educational way to onboard new users into crypto. We believe Earn and Learn programs are just beginning in the crypto space and have great potential for attracting and upskilling new developers into Cardano.\nWe have already started a pilot Ethereum Earn and Learn Program with promising initial results. In this program reward xDAI to blockchain newcomers from Venezuela for completing lessons. To find more about the Ethereum pilot program, visit the GitHub (https://github.com/BlockDevsUnited/learn-and-earn). And our Telegram group (https://t.me/learn_and_earn_crypto). Through this program we have successfully onboarded over a doezen Venezuelans into Ethereum and xDai chain, starting them on a journey to become blockchain developers!\nOver 50% of the funding will go straight to learners!\nThe Cardano Developer Earn to Learn Program will write structured lessons on Cardano Development and create evaluation criteria for each lesson. Evaluation will require participants to display their knowledge by deploying a practical application or hands on knowledge of the code, as well as answering text based questions. Developers can be verified through BrightID or another identity app. Once developers have completed the lesson, taken the test and passed, they will be eligible to receive an ADA reward.\nEach lesson includes theory, practical activities (such as forking and modifying github repos with Cardano tooling), and a final test.\nLessons include:\n- Cardano 101\n- Running Cardano Nodes\n- Deploying smart contracts on the KEVM\n- Creating Native Cardano tokens\n- Building Plutus smart contracts\n- and more\nThe Cardano Developer Earn to Learn Program would motivate developers to work through documents and code by systematically rewarding them for every step of the learning process they complete. The rewards would help create a positive developer experience and encourage the developer to build working dApps on Cardano and contribute to the ecosystem.\nRewards may be $3-10 per lesson\nReach and Audience\nThe Cardano Developer Earn to Learn Program will be promoted through BEN's network to over 100 universities to draw developers to Cardano from outside the ecosystem, using the existing group in Venezuela with the intention to grow the participant base in Latin America.\nAnother area of focus, should this grant be approved, is BEN's network of university clubs and members in West Africa, specifically in Ghana and Nigeria where there are currently 5 active BEN chapters. Cardano is already very popular with students in our BEN Africa chapter and this grant will help us provide them with the resources and tools they need to start building and contributing to the network. The BEN Africa and BEN LatAm chapters will be the focus of this grant, however any students from across BEN's 100+ universities and clubs will be able to and encouraged to participate in the program.\nBenefits for Participants\n- Developers both learn and earn\n- Soften the learning curve for learning Cardano tooling\n- Developers get ADA that they can use for further development on Cardano\n- Developers get to talk and meet each other\nBenefits for Cardano\n- Increase the number of developers building on Cardano\n- Systematically increase the number of repos using Cardano tooling\n- Foster community building and open technical conversations\n- Onboard developers from outside Cardano\n- Increase the number of developer ADA holders which increases developer adoption\nDefinition of Success\n1 month\n3 full Cardano Developer lessons created with testing criteria\n75+ developers completed lessons and earned ADA\nReceive positive feedback from learners\n3 months\n10 full Cardano Developer lessons created with testing criteria\n300+ developers completed lessons and earned ADA\nWe see examples of learners start to joinCardano projects or build their own\n6 months\n20 full Cardano Developer lessons created with testing criteria\n1000+ developers completed lessons and earned ADA\nRaised more funding to reward learners and expand to the next stage of the program\nWe see examples of Cardano projects hiring learners from the program\n1 year\nComprehensive Cardano lesson base, where devs can be incentivized to learn Cardano development, every step of the way.\n3000+ developers have completed lessons, and growing\nBudget\nLearner rewards, in ADA: 15000 USD\nLesson development and testing methods: 8000 USD\nAdmin Costs for Testers: 3500 USD\nCommunity Outreach: 1000 USD\nTotal: 27500 USD\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352468-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nADA MakerSpace will host a 16 Week Online Accelerator Program for 6 Startup Idea Teams in which we will help them validate their ideas using Lean Startup Principles.\n\nDuring the 16 weeks, ADA MakerSpace will develop 6 Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) for the Idea Teams to use in their go-to-market strategy.\n\nADA MakerSpace will make connections to VCs and Angels for Idea Teams that have traction with their MVPs and Validated their ideas.\n\nThe Accelerator Cohort meetings would be recorded and available to help others learn how to use Lean Startup Principles to launch their ideas on Cardano.

The deposit, management and distribution of funds are disintermediated using smart contracts dawn up in Plutus / Haskell.\n\nProjects must pass an audit process, presenting milestones and periodic results, in this way those involved will vote to release the money in a consensual manner.\n\nThe platform accepts payments in fiat currencies (USD, EUR, LBS, etc.) and cryptocurrencies (ADA, BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, USDT, etc)\n\nDeposits are stored in the ADA-based stable-token (a token referenced to the dollar) preserving the value of deposits and minimizing volatility arising from large fluctuations in crypto market. There are options for the selection of this coin which include the AGEUSD.\n\nThe cost of running the platform is recovered by charging a fee equal to 5% of the total amount raised if the project has reached its goal or receives an amount of donated funds. To support the Cardano community, we will reduce the fee to 2.5% for all projects that have been financed in a Project Catalyst Fund, without limitation of submissions.\n\nVery important see the attached files, they contain totally relevant information to understand the project.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Ecosystem Issues\n\nFund related issues\n\n1.

And the amount awarded is recognized to be insufficient to bring medium or large-scale projects to sustainability, increasing the potential for failure.\n\n2. The most likely investors in cryptocurrency projects are people or funds that understand and have invested in cryptocurrency previously and to date do not have platforms that accept them as payment, making it impossible to diversify their portfolio and they are forced to liquidate crypto holdings to fiat (in order to invest) may have created a taxable event.\n\n3. Project Catalyst is not likely to attract mainstream or even cryptocurrency investors, and projects are so far almost all very early stage, underfunded start-ups.\n\n4. Marginally financing a project does not ensure that it will be developed successfully.\n\n \n\nCatalyst Networking Issues\n\n1. Channels to identify co-founders, team members or advice in different areas are mixed-up. Discord, TG and IdeaScale have limited reach into the broad community of potential collaborators.\n\n2. Project Catalyst lacks a bridge to connect entrepreneurs and developers focused on funding startups in this new de-fi market.\n\n3. Project Catalyst does not have a clear space dedicated solely to the emergence of collaborations and projects.\n\n \n\nCommunity Related Issues\n\n1. Little reach to community member who do not speak English as their primary language.\n\n2. Geographic focus on US and Europe.\n\n3. A community with diverse objectives, which generate confusion and ineffectiveness.\n\n4. A community with little external reach to Cardano connoisseurs.\n\n5. Lack of commercial perspectives.\n\n6. Project are not designed to be self-sustaining.\n\n7. Lack of didactic content for the adoption of new users to the ecosystem.\n\n \n\nThe Innovatio Founder attempt to address these problems in the following way.\n\n• Offering a P2P platform organized to attract new developers and entrepreneurs to present projects and learn about Blockchain technology.\n\n• Reaching out to non-english speaking community (Initially Spanish speakers)\n\n• Aiming to establish Innovation Finder community in several countries to reach potential investors.\n\n• Facilitating investment using cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies expanding the pool of investors and collaborators.\n\n• Building Smart Contracts for the disintermediation of fund administration\n\n• Enabling investor oversight and consent in relation to the from periodic reporting on KPI's or milestones.\n\n• Developing a network designed to facilitate new users joining the community, helping to learn this technology, generating content and offering productive tools for them.\n\n• Facilitating mutual collaboration between entrepreneurs and developers with defined communication channels thus offering an improvement in the quality of projects.\n\n• Developing audiovisual content for the arrival of new users, contributing to their creativity on the implementations of blockchain technology.\n\n• Developing bilingual content, Spanish-English, expanding the scope of networking to many countries.\n\n• Support due diligence efforts to help projects present a more serious and objective plan.\n\n \n\nEvolution of the project\n\nThe Innovatio Founder team has already been hard at work of:\n\n• Legal compliance.\n\n• Implementing payment gateway.\n\n• Building smart contracts, multisignature procedures, audit process to secure the funds.\n\n• Developing networking channels in Discord and TG.\n\n• Assembling a solid team of 8 techs, UIX development specialists, back-end, dev-ops and system engineers, achieving great communication and understanding of the project.\n\n• Self-financing of the project for 4 months and the next 2.\n\n• Created a target roadmap.\n\n• Creating a beta website, re-fund mechanism, external wallet connection linked to each user, etc.\n\n \n\nWhy we chose Development Ecosystem?\n\n• The Innovatio Founder is much more than a DApp, it is a large-scale project that differs in a crucial point from a DApp, it is a web based platform, with his own database and isn't running in the blockchain.\n\n• Our mission is to help both developers and entrepreneurs achieve sustainable success.\n\n• We provide tools (non-blockchain, non dAPP) so that proposers can work more efficiently and focus on generating new projects.\n\n• Our discord server provides clear communication channels to promote mutual collaboration between professionals. (Innovatio Finder)\n\n• The funds requested also go to contribute to the expansion of the community in several countries, in turn generating a greater attraction of developers and facilitating the adoption of the technology.\n\n \n\nWhat KPIs measure the success? Next 3 months.\n\n1. Projects presented that use blockchain technology.\n\n2. Users on Discord server.\n\n3. Projects that have gotten significant help from the Discord server.\n\n4. Followers on social media\n\n5. Participants in beta-testing, MVP and MCP.\n\n6. Amount of ADA delegated to the Innovatio pool.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\n• Launch of the Landing Page for the Beta-Tester registration. (24/04)\n\n• Registered a company in Estonia. (E-Residency) (May/June)\n\n• Build our own pool for the Cardano delegation. (May/June)\n\n• Configure a Discord server such as basic networking (text channels, labels, categories, bots, etc) (in the future a platform will be launched with the name of Innovatio Finder) (May/June)\n\n• Payment of fees for licenses required to operate in the European Union (AFS) (June/July)\n\n• Launch of the MVP (Navigation of the Website, Project Draft Development, Audit Process Experience, Configuration and Customization of each User, Connection with External Wallet, etc) (June/July)\n\n• Launch of the MCP (improvements at the design and navigation of each user, implementation of the Smart Contracts for the Re-Fund process and real-time conversion of the funds, last retouching before the final version) (July/August)\n\n• Audit of Smart Contracts for legal use within the platform. (August)\n\n• Launch of the final platform to market. (September)\n\n \n\nDefinition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months\n\nOur success in this chronological stage would be:\n\n3 months:\n\n1. Achieve the registration of 50 beta-testers to obtain quality feedback for the latest version of the platform.\n\n2. Have a community destined for the blockchain on Discord of 500 people.\n\n3. Get the complete MVP with all the functions described.\n\n4. Periodic interaction with the community for the continuous improvement of the project.\n\n5. Offer a place of collaboration and impulse for new start-ups that implement blockchain technology.\n\n6. Have a presence in social networks and daily content.\n\n \n\n6 months:\n\n1. Have a Discord server of more than 2500 people.\n\n2. To be a leading start-up in the adoption of blockchain technology for the market.\n\n3. Have designated people and defined channels with programs for objective help to new projects development.\n\n4. Periodic interaction with the community for the continuous improvement of the project.\n\n5. Offer a learning and development space for blockchain technology with external education projects.\n\n6. Offer a place of collaboration and impulse for new start-ups that implement blockchain technology.\n\n7. Development of the MCP (pre-final) platform with the execution of the Smart-Contracts, consensus of liquid democracy in each project and the execution of the re-fund of the funds to each wallet.\n\n \n\n12 months:\n\n1. Begin to process the necessary licenses to incorporate the DEBT category to the platform.\n\n2. To be a totally self-sustaining platform.\n\n3. Focus on the development of the Innovatio Finder platform.\n\n4. To be the main platform that promotes the financing of various blockchain projects.\n\n \n\nWe reiterate the IMPORTANCE of reviewing the attached documents, which explains the budget breakdown, team members and their LinkedIn profiles, the technical section, and the Business Plan is very important to understand the platform model.\n\nOur website is now available, enter and register to be able to try the MVP beta-testing!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpanish Interview:\n\nSocial Networks\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InnovatioGroup\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InnovatioFounder\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/innovatiofounder\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/tcrdaytKDg\n\nSpanish Telegram Group: https://t.me/innovatiofinderesp\n\nEnglish Telegram Group: https://t.me/innovatiofindereng","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352260-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352236-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352235-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThe Cardano Improvement Proposal number 12 defines on-chain stake pool operator to delegates communication.\n\n \n\nTo take advantage of this CIP, communication method needs to be implemented in Yoroi backend software, so that Yoroi and other lighweight wallet can make use of it.\n\n \n\nWe will implement and propose an enhancement to Yoroi backend software that will create a new endpoint that could be used to query all communication methods defined in CIP12.\n\n \n\nhttps://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0012/CIP-0012.md\n\n \n\nWe know this project doesn't completely fit within the developer ecosystem challenge.

Adds another service to their value-add stack. Or we can workout another network scheme if needed.\n* Operate the client-side libraries as a perpetual service to the Cardano community of developers and users. Provide support, maintenance and upgrades.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n* Developers benefit with a solution to the ease-of-use problem for DApps and contracts.\n\n \n\n* Developers benefit from a high-quality API Handshake has already deployed allowing open querying.\n\n \n\n* Supports multi-wallet/ multi-currency and other applications.\n\n \n\n* Offers a system to fight scam addresses with blacklisting ability.\n\n \n\n* Handshake benefits with greater use and a Proof of Stake solution compatible with theirs.\n\n \n\n* Cardano benefits from all the integration work Handshake has already undertaken.\n\n \n\n* Stakepool operators benefit with another service they can accumulate small transaction fees.\n\n \n\n* Users benefit from ease-of-use improvements to the ecosystem.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nGeneral Availability (GA) is approximately 8-weeks from start date.

The system should be up and running in General Availability (GA).\n6-month: Active and Fully Operational (FO).\n12-month: Working within the wider blockchain community with many of the list of collaborators listed below, and adopting our model for use with the wider community.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe NFT-DAO is committed to building infrastructure components that improve the use of NFTs on Cardano and deploy easy solutions for the community.\nWe see EZ-Name—the Cardano Name Service (CNS), as an integral part of making the Cardano ecosystem more user-friendly.\n\nWe have two complementary goals:\n\nOn the user side, we believe that in every instance a user might otherwise see a Cardano address or content hash, they should instead see an EZ-Name domain.\n\nOn the developer side, we envision a future in which EZ-Name is not something your DApp might use, it's something without which your DApp remains unfinished. (Who would make a website today and not use DNS?)\n\nThis means doing things like the following:\n* All wallets should allow users to input EZ-Name domains (rather than only Cardano addresses) in the \"Send to\" field for sending tokens.\n\n* All wallets should display an EZ-Name domain as the user's wallet address (via Reverse Lookup; and this should be done rather than showing a Cardano address, which could still be accessed via an \"advanced\" option, or shown below the name).\n\n* Wallets and DApps can give users subdomains in the user on-boarding process to use as their username/wallet address.\n\n* All DApp contracts that users interact with should be displayed and used with an EZ-Name domain. This allows developers to substitute Cardano addresses without rewriting/publishing their code.\n\n* Making your offline storage content (i.e.; NFTs) available via an EZ-Name domain (which makes it accessible via CNS compliant browsers).\n\n* The system works like a DNS (Domain Name Service) and therefore is useable for wallet addresses, websites and anything a decentralized ID can and will be assignable to.\n\nThere is of course significant integration work that needs to take place following the implementation. Once the system is installed and up and running for our domain names, there are numerous other systems that are already intrenched in the centralized web and some in the decentralized web that will need to be thoughtfully considered in integration. That is why this is the fastest solution, because Handshake is already well along the way making the right moves toward collaborative integrations that EZ-Name will benefit from.\n\nWe want to do everything we can to help developers by making this happen:\n* We will build EZ-Name as the Cardano Name Service (CNS) an ENS-like service to provide a more user friendly experience for the developer community we seek to attract to Cardano. It will also benefit the complete community as well. This can be used for things like trading NFT's among friends or easily searching/finding various creators.\n\n* EZ-Name's job is to map human-readable names like 'alice.ada' to machine-readable identifiers such as Cardano addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. EZ-Name will also support 'reverse resolution', making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Cardano addresses.\n\n* EZ-Name has similar goals to DNS, the Internet's Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture, due to the capabilities provided by the Cardano blockchain. Like DNS, EZ-Name operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\n\n* Top-level domains, like '.ada' and '.sft' follow specific rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use.\n\n* Because of the hierarchal nature of CNS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.ada', she can create 'pay.alice.ada' and configure it as she wishes.\n\nGUIDING QUESTIONS\n\nWhat are the the tools that we need to prioritize first\nOur model centers on a NFT Framework of composable parts that continue to add functionality and ease the developer and user experience. Weighing that against the development cycles required to produce the components, this project fills a large gap in a short period of time.\n\nHow do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\nCreating integrations that are useable across chains and ecosystems is one way, and this is thought through with this proposal.\n\nWhat do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\nDevelopers want tools and approaches that make their lives simpler. They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This project is well thought out and implemented already, it simply needs to be ported over and adjusted for the new environment. It will start small and grow over time with extensions.\n\nWhat would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?\nIt has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with this project.\n\nWhat are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\nWether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. That is the reason a friendly fork of the Handshake project makes more sense than any other implementation.\n\nHandshake was forked from a previous project that has numerous enterprise clients, bcoin . io is a solid basis and Handshake has a several year history of operations. Building from it, with the MuKn Glow team will offer us the quality of code required by the enterprise.\n\nWHO WILL DELIVER THIS SOLUTION?\n\nTEAM MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE\nFrançois-René \"Faré\" Rideau - CEO++,++ Co-Founder, has been making programming languages and distributed systems usable for 25 years. Alumnus of the École Normale Supérieure, Former Senior Engineer at ITA Software, he also worked at Google and Bridgewater Associates.\n\nWhile working in the industry, he notably maintained and rewrote ASDF, the build system at the heart of the Common Lisp open source community; he also kept publishing academic papers and speaking at programming language conferences; early in his career, he even proved in Coq the correctness of a (centralized) payment protocol.\n\nEventually, his interests in economics and software security converged with his experience in open source software and formal methods and he started working on Layer 2 solutions for the Blockchain. Since January 2018, he has made plenty of mistakes as co-founder of startups, and learned the hard way to become his own CEO.\n\nAlexander Smart - Chief Operations Officier, Co-Founder, has always thought fast, but learned to think deep and sharp at UChicago. After studying law at Pepperdine, he spent nearly fifteen years guiding executives and decision makers through litigation, in matters ranging from shoplifting and speeding tickets to multi-forum international investment bank disputes.\n\nHis practice honed his ability to quickly assimilate and master new information, and deliver that information clearly at any level of sophistication. Tiring of courthouses, he found his skills were readily applicable and desperately needed in the blockchain space.\n\nGauthier Lamothe - Chief Communications Officer, Co-Founder, has been a seasoned coach, psychotherapist and instructor in communication and management.\n\nHe doubled his career as a media expert (film and software producer, then e-marketing manager).\n\nHe participated in the development of a few blockchains, for entities such as the Free Republic of Liberland, and worked on decentralized justice systems, tokenization of governance, and of course crypto-currencies.\n\nHis work in the MuKn ecosystem is to take care of every aspect related to communications and human issues, both within the company and with customers and partners, for awareness of human-related safety risks are often dramatically underestimated in the blockchain space.\n\n \n\nAlexander Knauth - Developer, Alexander studied at Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science and achieved a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, where he researched Type Systems and Macros.\n\nCo-author of two research papers at POPL, he also contributed to the Racket programming language.\n\nCurrently working for Mutual Knowledge Systems Inc. after a first collaboration on another project for Alacris/Legilogic\n\n \n\nDrew Crampsie - Developer, Drew is an independent systems developer with over 20 years of experience in designing, implementing and maintaining Internet based applications and servers with a focus on \"bleeding edge\" Web Apps.\n\nDrew is a seasoned user in non-mainstream and mainstream techs and languages (Scheme, Common Lisp, SQL, Javascript, C…).\n\nEmeka Nwanko - Developer, After graduating in 2005 from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Emeka Nwanko worked for several companies as a Field Engineer or Operations Manager, such as Schlumberger Nigeria or Northern Oilfield Services and Supplies.\nHe also worked for Satajanus Nigeria Limited as a software developer in the field of Blockchain industry, both in C# and F#, but also in Rust and Solidity.\n\nHe also offers free programming classes as a teacher.\n\n \n\nTEAM NFT-DAO\nOur team is drawing talent in at this writing over 320+ persons joined our NFT-DAO Discord. We're embracing everyone who strongly desires an overarching NFT framework on Cardano—especially those who proposed NFT solutions—and invite you to join our NFT DAO that will open-source the patterns we build as a community. Join us in a coordinated and consolidated effort. Others have already merged their proposal. You'll join:\n\nRich Kopcho, a life-long entrepreneur building 18 start-ups in his career. He has owned and managed a development shop and open-sourced the successful 'Restore' backup solution. He taught manufacturers around the world Holonic manufacturing (1997-2007); a heterarchical systems and technology approach that is the foundation DAOs are based on. He currently operates a venture studio in Laramie WY building technology solutions with partners. Rich is the executive producer of the Wyoming Blockchain Stampede - an annual conference by UWYO that IOHK/Cardano/Emurgo and others sponsor to educate the blockchain community.\n\nMichael Yagi, a senior software engineer with experience facilitating integration between different technologies across many different facets in a smooth, seamless fashion. He has a background in leading the development for projects that need to ship projects with many unknowns in a timely manner. His interest lie in building the bridge between the ocean and the pond (Cardano and \"traditional\" software engineering) as well as leveraging his game development background for NFT's in the game industry.\n\nTomas Garro, an entrepreneur passionate about blockchain and web3 potential. Long-term Cardano advocate looking to grow and promote its ecosystem through developing blockchain business solutions and content creation on social media. WHO MERGED HIS PROPOSAL WITH US! And joins NFT-DAO as a Product Lead.\n\nTyler Wales, an entrepreneur with product development and management expertise, and experience bringing new solutions to market. He has launched multiple profitable businesses in media and technology and has established relationships in film production and distribution. Tyler is currently a mentor at Portland Incubator Experiment.\n\nCommunity Members n+1, is passionate about NFTs and has aligned themselves to a previous proposal seeking funding for a NFT point solution. They are eager to build their business model on top of a solid framework. Since none has existed for Cardano, they were planning to build one for themselves from scratch. They are one of ~300 individuals who could potentially pool their expertise into an all-embracing open-source version to benefit the entire community rather than one project. Their expertise is multivariate in development, SPO, marketing, design, business, and more.\n\nPOTENTIAL COLLABORATIVE LANDSCAPE (who we will eventually need to integrate with)\n\nICANN has been the root namespace for the internet.

They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This project will start small and grow over time with the direction the research takes us.\n\nWhat would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?\n\nIt has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with this project.\n\nWhat are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\n\nWether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. That is why interoperability makes more sense than any other implementation.\n\n \n\nWHO WILL DELIVER THIS SOLUTION?\n\nTEAM MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE\n\nFrançois-René \"Faré\" Rideau - CEO++,++ Co-Founder, has been making programming languages and distributed systems usable for 25 years.

Fully Operational (FO) is approximately 9-months from start date.\n\nThis is a project that is very much needed and fully inline with the concept of this challenge asking: How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps? A great API for an often used component is exactly what this EZ-Pay API is.\n\nPLAN AND BUDGET\n\nUtilizing Glow Language and the MuKn team's expertise, we will start building integrations to selected payment methods. First we will be researching the specific candidates. The goal of EZ-On API is developers can simply use it to connect to payment options. We will of course build this into the NFT Framework for all marketplaces to use.\n\nPhase 1\n\n- Research the payment systems we will connect with, like wallets, Visa, Paypal, Venmo etc.\n\n- Market testing developers for their wish list\n\nPhase 2\n\n- Prioritize Resource Utilization\n\n- Assign teams and workload\n\n- Mutual Knowledge will handle the development\n\n- NFT-DAO will handle the commercialization (requirements, website, market research, partnerships, operations)\n\nPhase 3\n\n- Run Sprints to build components needed\n\n- Document API as development occurs\n\n- Start on SDK\n\nPhase 4\n\n- Testing, Audit and hardening (dev/ops teams doing verification testing)\n\n- Complete API documents\n\n- Firm up the SDK\n\nPhase 5\n\n- Go Live (alpha and beta testing in real world conditions)\n\nPhase 6\n\n- G/A Launch (General Availability for developers to use)\n\nTotal: $69, 945#\n\n# Includes contract development, marketing and operational estimates allowing for a 12-month launch cycle.\n\nDEFINED SUCCESS REPORTING\n\n3-month: Post funding much of this work will be available to see firsthand and can be followed in the Github repository. The system will be taking shape and the first simple connectors should be operational in MVP and beta mode.\n\n6-month: The MVP API will be active in General Availability (GA) and Fully Operational (FO).\n\n12-month: Many additional payment services will be available and the API and SDK v1.0 fully in use. (we can't say until we do the research exactly how many services will be available in 12-months, but our goal is to move as quickly as we can).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nEZ-Pay API\n\nThe EZ-Pay API will allow developers to access the full functionality of EZ-Pay. Some example API methods we are planning include sending invoices, accepting payments, managing subscription billing, and editing and managing account information. EZ-Pay is a service that allows users to accept payments online, specifically developers. With the EZ-Pay application, users can keep track of payments, search past payments, create recurring charges, and keep track of customers. We want to bring similar use models common to Web2.0 internet e-commerce over to Web3.0 blockchains. This is not an easy feat, so we need your support!\n\nIn our winning Fund 3 proposal for an \"NFT Framework\", we promised to add connectors, extensions and enhancements. This EZ-Pay API is one of those tools developers need and want. An easy-to-use payment solution. NFT Marketplaces who use the NFT Framework will be delighted to have this easy way to accept payments for NFT auctions and sales.\n\nOne line of code is the promise of Stripe (a payment API—Application Program Interface). While we wish Stripe was that simple, we know it's a lot simpler than Web3 blockchain technology is now. We want to change that!\n\nOur goal with the EZ-On Tech Suite of solutions is making it easy to onboard all developers, but especially those coming over from the Ethereum blockchain in this proposal.\n\nLet's make wallets and payments on Cardano as simple as one line of code to connect and use in any DApp through an API that delights developers.\n\n \n\nBRIDGING DIGITAL AND FIAT\n\nVISA\n\nIn March 2021: Visa has selected the USDC stablecoin as their pilot asset, and set about making the infrastructure upgrades necessary to mesh key components of digital currencies with Visa's treasury operations. They've been hard at work over the last several months, working to support a number of key functions:\n\n* Support reconciliation and currency conversion for stablecoins such as USDC\n\n* Integrate Visa's treasury systems with Anchorage, as Visa's digital asset settlement agent\n\n* Support a new Visa settlement report that includes settlement obligations along with public blockchain addresses for account management of crypto wallets and issuers.\n\nAfter months of anticipation and careful planning, they completed the first successful settlement transaction this month —with Crypto.com sending USDC to Visa's Ethereum address at Anchorage. One small step forward for Visa's settlement platform, one giant step forward for the integration of digital and traditional fiat currencies. After further testing and additional conversations with clients, partners and members of the regulatory community, they hope to launch this capability for other partners in the year ahead. We want to be one of those partners.\n\nThe good news is, since Glow is helping us, and they have expertise in EVM, we feel confident we have a way forward with Visa.\n\nPayPal\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will announce later on Tuesday that it has started allowing U.S. consumers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of its online merchants globally, a move that could significantly boost use of digital assets in everyday commerce. - Mar 30, 2021\n\nVenmo\n\nMarch 22, 2021: At this moment, 2 platforms accept Venmo: Localbitcoin(dot)com and Paxful(dot)com. Choose a broker, and open an account. From there you can use Venmo to purchase Bitcoin.\n\n \n\nGUIDING QUESTIONS\n\nWhat are the the tools that we need to prioritize first\n\nOur model centers on a NFT Framework of composable parts that continue to add functionality and ease the developer and user experience. Weighing that against the development cycles required to produce the components, this project fills a large gap in a short period of time. Payments are a core infrastructure need any developer can tell you so.\n\nHow do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\n\nCreating integrations that are useable across chains and ecosystems is one way, and this is thought through with this proposal. Making payments as easy as connecting one line of code is the holy grail of development.\n\nWhat do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\n\nDevelopers want tools and approaches that make their lives simpler. They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This EZ-Pay API will deliver exactly what developers want. It will start small and grow over time with extensions.\n\nWhat would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?\n\nIt has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with the EZ-Pay API.\n\nWhat are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\n\nWether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. APIs are a standard in enterprise solutions. Good documentation is a must. We plan to deliver both. Building with the MuKn Glow team will offer us the quality of code required by the enterprise.\n\nWHO WILL DELIVER THIS SOLUTION?\n\nTEAM MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE\n\nFrançois-René \"Faré\" Rideau - CEO++,++ Co-Founder, has been making programming languages and distributed systems usable for 25 years.

Any documentation or media I produce related to this project will be provided under a creative commons \"copyleft\" license.\n\n \n\nBudget and Goals:\n400 dollars/week × 52 weeks = 20,800 dollars\n(That's 83% of minimum wage where I currently live for a 40-hour work week)\n\n \n\nThough, $400 a week is a low wage where I'm currently living, I'm leaving for Malawi in June, where that amount will take me a lot further as well as help me continue to supplement the income of the four members of my team who I'm going to be training over there.\n\n \n\nI'd be happy to take payments on a weekly basis or whatever strategy makes the most sense… as my code will be openly available on GitHub, it will be easy to track my progress. When I'm in Malawi, my friends and I are planning to continue the podcast we started in December, and I plan on sharing my progress on this project as part of that.\n\n \n\nMy main goal for this project is to better understand Marlowe and Plutus Core and to work on ways to visualize their semantic structures and how they relate to each other as well as the workings of the Cardano blockchain. I want this tool to make it easy to build and test contracts with an interface that's optimized for touch-based input, so that there isn't a burden on my initial students to buy devices they don't already own. Lowering the financial barrier to entry will also increase the possible scalability of training.\n\n \n\nTimeline and Deliverables:\n\nCurrent Progress: During Fund2, I started working on an alternative way to visualize Marlowe, and I've also been studying the Marlowe and Plutus code written in Haskell and Purescript as well as the Plutus Core Specification. I've bought my ticket to Malawi, and I'm currently going through the process of deciding what I'm going to pack to take with me and what I'm going to leave behind. I've also bought some sound equipment for the podcast my friends and I will be working on once I'm in Africa.\nMay: I'll continue whittling down on my belongings until it will fit into my two check-in boxes and one carry-on. If everything I need doesn't fit, I have a friend who can help me get a good deal on mailing stuff if I need to. I've got a lot of books that would be useful for my research and teaching. Digitizing notebooks, financial preparations, going through all the Plutus and Marlowe content on the internet, integrating work I've got split up into different projects that will be useful for this project into a single codebase, etc…\nJune: During the first week, I'll be finishing up my preparations to leave. I'll be traveling and getting situated during the second week. After that, I'll begin to work with my team to teach them about functional programming, Cardano, the Catalyst Project, Marlowe, and Plutus. The process of teaching them will help me refine my ideas for this project as my goal is to use it primarily as a teaching tool that people can use on devices they already have.\nQ3 of 2021: Within this timeframe, I should have a graphical touch-based interface for working with Marlowe ASTs that doesn't rely on drag-and-drop, and that only shows you valid sub-expressions to be placed in a hole at any given context. Blockly has some shortcomings that hinder productivity if you're trying to use it to build smart contracts. One of these is the lack of abstractions such as named expressions that can be used multiple times in a contract. It should be fairly easy to get to the place where you can at least build Marlowe contracts in a way where impossible states are not representable save the possibility of type holes. When all the type holes are gone, you should at least be able to export the data structure as a chunk of Haskell code and paste it into the Playground, if not being able to simulate it with a visualization of the timeline and, possibly, its different permutations.\nQ4 of 2021: My primary focus for this project will shift from Marlowe to Plutus. For the near future, I'm going to avoid the high-level Haskell code in this project and focus on the low-level semantics of Plutus Core. It's a fairly simple language with some interesting features like simply typed lambda calculus at the type level, kinds, and reduction to normal form at both the term and type levels. During this quarter I plan on extending the interface I'll build for Marlowe to work with Plutus Core as well including visualization of types and kinds.\nQ1 of 2022 and beyond (if not sooner): There are many ways to add value to this project, and some will be ongoing areas of research. I want to make an interactive implementation of the Plutus Core Spec that allows you to normalize or evaluate code examples in the document, as well as the Environment (Γ) and how it tracks variable assignment and type correctness. I also want to work on ways to make it easier to learn the symbolic expressions found in programming language research papers… Visualization of smart contract operation in the context of the blockchain as well as native tokens and their minting policies… Exploration of the way that Plutus Core is generated from Haskell and Marlowe, as well as how they relate to the system space of all possible Plutus Core applications… Exploration of different abstractions that can be built on Plutus core and how they relate to the semantic properties of various other programming languages such as Elm, Pony, the Pie language from The Little Typer, μKanren, and the K Framework… I may also still consider working on a way to use this interface for Plutus-based game scripting.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352064-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nAdditional Functional Details:\nEveryone is very excited about NFTs right now. Using an NFT as an authentication certificate opens up a whole new world of possibilities. We will provide a NFT based access service that will create even more excitement, increase adoption, drive additional transactions on Cardano, and quite possibly increase the value of NFTs.\nWant the ability to grant NFT-based access to the executive bathroom at work? NFTkey.me will get you there. (hopefully you laughed)\nOn a more serious note, access-control to private discord channels, newsletters, websites, mobile applications and more can governed by proven Cardano-based NFT ownership.\nMaybe someone creates a really exciting new virtual game. Within the game, there's a special \"Star Wars\" themed bar that only people with a combination of NFTs can enter (let's say you need a S1 CardanoKidz and a SpaceBudz to get in). Nftkey.me will provide the service that game can use for access control.\nThese are just a couple ideas; we hope you get the picture. NFT based access-control will drive even greater demand for NFTs, increase adoption of Cardano, increase use of the network, and generally show off what's possible.\nWe've already documented the base use cases and functional requirements to make all of this happen.\nTechnical Details:\nWe will build a service for users to verify and manage what NFTs they own as well as track ownership over time. There are several possibilities of how this can be accomplished. The first implementation of the service will have a user provide an address they own and then provide them an ada amount to send to that address from the same wallet. This confirms ownership of the staking key and will allow us to query all NFTs they own. They will be able to do this for any number of wallets they own and we will be able to automatically detect new NFTs added to the wallet automatically. Future iterations may look into providing a mechanism to sign messages using the private keys that own the NFT. The main components of the NFT ownership service will involve account creation, wallet ownership flows, a service to monitor addresses using Blockfrost.io and a database to store all the data.\nThe service will then allow integrators to access users' information using standard OAuth 2 authorization code and user consent flows. An integrator will create an account, provide appropriate redirect urls and receive credentials. The integrators will then redirect users to our service, where the user will consent to give access to a list of their owned NFTs to a particular integration. The integrator will then be provided with an access key they could use to query our API for NFTs the user owns. Components of this integrator service will include an OAuth 2 server, integrator creation flows, an API for querying a user's owned NFTs which will also utilize Blockfrost.io, documentation on how to use the service, and an example implementation. This may also include a service to monitor NFTs moving between wallets and notifications to integrators.\nThe benefit to this architecture is that user's only have to verify wallets they own once, then can simply consent to access to their information for each integration. They don't need to prove ownership multiple times which can be inconvenient, especially when using hardware or offline wallets.\nChallenge Question:\nHow does NFT Key create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?\nDevelopers just want to build. They don't want to build tools to then build. NFT Key will become a powerful tool in developers' toolboxes that help them create applications, forums, websites, and more that utilize NFTs in fun and unique ways. What better experience for a developer to need a tool and find that it's already available to use?\nMetrics:\nHow does NFT Key impact the challenge metrics around the question, \"Did we manage to make it easier for developers to build on top of Cardano?\"\nWe're in the early days of Cardano. NFTs are the big thing that have traction right now. Savvy developers are figuring out how to take advantage of this community interest.\nA natural next step is utilizing NFTs for a functional purpose. But every developer shouldn't need to replicate the same functionality over and over again. NFTkey.me will provide the services necessary for developers to integrate NFT based OAuth 2 flows into their apps. This will:\n\nAttract developers who are looking for out of the box capabilities and services\nEnable developers to then focus on their area of expertise and specific business cases\nDrive integrated use cases and platforms built on Cardano\nIncrease overall development activity which will drive greater sense of community and conversations\n\nWe believe that NFT Key will drive a whole new set of development activities on Cardano.\nPersonnel:\nChris and Dan have the necessary skills and experience to successfully execute this work within the proposed timeframe. We've successfully run stake pools on the ITN and Mainnet for over 12 months (this is verifiable). This includes the same front-end, back-end, blockchain and operations experience necessary to successfully execute this proposal.\nSeparately (admittedly less verifiable), we've previously co-founded a social-media related startup and have both worked professional in software related R&D, operations, and project management related fields for close to two decades each.\nWe have access to additional personnel with the necessary skill sets to crash/fast track (project management terms for bringing more people and doing things in parallel) the work if desired. However, these resources might not be the most cost-effective option.\nAlternatively, we'd prefer to hire and collaborate with front-end and back-end developers already working in the Cardano ecosystem. This will be a great way for us to grow our network, assess abilities of other developers in within the ecosystem, and provide opportunities for other people too.\nBudget:\n\nFront-end web development - $10,000\nBack-end web development - $15,000\nMarketing & Business Development - $10,000\nOngoing Operations for 12 months - $10,000\nHosting, Tools & Services - $2,500\nContingencies (Reserves) - $2,500\n\nSchedule:\n\nPrior to award - Given a positive initial response to our proposal, we'll begin prototyping the service \"at-risk\" prior to voting.\n2 months ARA – We will launch a base service for user authentication and integrator account creation within 2 months after receipt of award (ARA).

Yes, we hear you!\nPlease support our project with CLAPS & VOTES and if we are selected, we will organize a small contest to deliver 3 robots to the community at Cardano to TEST the tools we are going develop for the blockchain.\nHurry and don't miss out. Your support will be most appreciated by us!!!\nThe Real Problem\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) projects should offer better transparency. However, many such projects are developed in isolation that result in bias inherent with such algorithms which will in turn promote division within society at large. Research link:-\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/bias-in-ai-a-problem-recognized-but-still-unresolved/\nEXAMPLE: Imagine a swarm of \"Cop Robots\" that patrol the streets greeting people and looking ( VISION ) for miss-behaviors. These robots could communicate (VOICE RECOGNITION or CLOUD COMPUTING ) over a blockchain and have action-triggers with smart-contracts. These could run when they spot one person hurting another, to have the system vote on the best strategy to approach the scene or to call for help. But to achieve this type of behavior, it is necessary that smart-contracts have improved security and are able to interact with information from outside the blockchain.\nHow we can solve this problem\nWe will create a baseline API to our SDK that leverages the immutable ledger and transparency of the blockchain as a public tool for AI/ML developers to train their AI/ML programs and algorithms on a decentralized network for better transparency and elimination of bias.\nYou can see here the SDK/BLOCKCHAIN Diagram\nhttps://thecorpora.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ONE-SDK_2-1.png\nWe are not newbies in the Business\nWe understand AI/ML development and we have over 10 years experience with AI and Interactive Robotics. We are first in the world to demonstrate a robot recognizing itself in the mirror and having two robots share image recognition data in the cloud across two different cities. We can build a baseline SDK that can be expanded for any kind of application.\n\nHow Big is the Market\nBlockchain can be used to decentralize federated learning algorithms so that the benefits of these collective training models are shared across multiple owners of data with less inherent bias with algorithms. The size of AI training datasets are worth US$4.8 billion by 2027 with CAGR of 22.5%. Our decentralized blockchain model can grow this market further.\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ai-training-dataset-market-size-worth-4-8-billion-by-2027--cagr-22-5-grand-view-research-inc-301064957.html\nThecorpora specializes in robotics and artificial intelligence. We are the creator and owner of the Q.bo series of open-source robots. Founded in 2008, Thecorpora has accumulated more than 10 years of experience in building interactive robots.\nOur baseline interactive robot, Q.bo was introduced in 2011. It is patented and built as a developmental platform. It has since been sold to hundreds of Universities and Technology Companies worldwide.\nThe team is led by Francisco Javier Paz who has extensive experience in business, robotics & technology. He has probably the largest vintage computing collection in Europe.\nHow can we incorporate new developers to the Cardano Blockchain?\nWe can start with developing an Open Source SDK for AI/ML applications in Natural Language and Speech Recognition which can be tested with our Open Sourced robots. This forms the baseline for integration with other tool sets to test AI/ML applications and algorithms with training data on the blockchain.\nOver the last 10 years, we have a wide and strong community in various universities and research centers for our open source robots. They help build Q.bo's open source platform on GITLAB. Our existing SDK allows us to develop Computer Vision, Natural Language and Speech Recognition applications.\nIn this first phase of development, we want to create a new intermediate layer (API) that serves as an intercom between the operating system and the vision systems, speech and voice recognition. This will allow all these centers that work with our robot to develop new applications on the Blockchain and have it tested on the robot.\nThis will be the baseline model of how blockchain can be used to validate and acquire data models for AI/ML applications.\nHow are we going to reach new developers in the future?\nOnce the new Open Source API for our SDK is finalized, we can send it to all our community so that they can validate and provide feedback for them. It is a ready set of users for the new API/SDK that link to the Blockchain.\nIn 2017 we launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo with great success since in just over 1 month we raised more than $ 200,000. Our intention is that throughout 2022 we will launch another new campaign with the fully finished SDK in the two largest crowdfunding companies in the world, Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which will give greater visibility to the Cardano project and attract new users and developers to the ecosystem that is constantly expanding and evolving.\nWhat are we going to spend the money on?\nWe want to create a new team of engineers and developers within our company that specialized in working with Blockchain as well as build a new RACK of mini-servers for sending vision, speech and recognition data and patterns to the Cardano network.\nWith the rest of the money we will send updated robots to some universities that can help us improve the API of our SDK, some of them will be in Africa.\nPutting a Price on a Vision\nIn order to bring their vision into reality our project is seeking a budget of $80,000. This will oversee phase one of their proposal, which will be divided as follows.\nFour team members\nUSD 25 hourly rate\n18hs avg per week per person\nEstimated Total of 32 weeks\n$25 x 18 hs/week x 4 people x 32 weeks of total work.\nThey would like to emphasise that the above does not mean all members will be working 18 hours a week, for the entire 32 weeks. It's merely an estimate of the overall linear team effort required. Tasks will be prioritized and distributed according to skills, as needed. The budget and deliverables for each task will be estimated and agreed upon by the team. This is in line with the same principles our project aspires to uphold.\nThe rest of the money will be for mini servers and robots for the community in order to test the API.\nThe public date launch will be at the end of the year. Betatesters will have a demo months before the end date.\nWe are Pioneers in Cloud Computing\nIn 2011, we performed in \"real time\" at different locations in front of hundreds of witnesses on Q.bo's ability to learn and share information in a \"centralized\" cloud computing system. We want to expand this initiative to cover information sharing in a decentralized network. Imagine thousands of robots share and learn in a decentralized network? That is our goal!\nYou can see the video here ( Spanish Version ): \nCompany Accolades\n\\> In 2011, Thecorpora was also named by Intel to be one of the most promising companies in 10 years to come.\n\\> Top 1% crowdfunded product in Indiegogo in 2017 raising over 380% of original sales target.\n\\> Q.bo One is one of 3 projects unveiled at IBM Partner Conference in 2017.\n\\> Featured by Arrow (Fortune 500) on how we win the trust of backers during the crowdfunding exercise.\nABOUT US\nWe have sold thousands of robots to Partners & Customers from 49 Countries in 6 Continents.

By announcing this strategy of development we can empower developers to contribute more to the open source libraries designed to solve these problems.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhat I see currently happening is that developers install dependencies and as soon as they need something that the libraries don't provide they code it in the source code of their projects, this is against the principle of separation of concerns or single responsibility.\n\n \n\n \n\nYour app probably shouldn't have the code to access some API, that can be done in a separate SDK library.\n\nThe workspace allows the developers to easily tap into both codebases.\n\n \n\n(Funny note: that can lead to multiple instances of VSCode being open and a real reason to use multiple monitors beyond the aesthetics)\n\n \n\n \n\nMy plan\n\nIf I get funded I will spend the next 2 months announcing, teaching and contributing to this repo.

Payments can be made using native tokens (such as STABLECOINS) and/or ADA, in any app, webstore or e-commerce platform.\nFor this round we will focus on the backend by creating tools that will enable developers to setup and use a Free Commerce server, or integrate with a Free Commerce server provider. Basically this backend will allow developers to create applications (such as online stores and mobile apps) that can process payments in any token available on the cardano blockchain.\nThis is infrastructure that can later be used to create integrations with large e-commerce platforms, such as shopify and woocommerce etc, and become more accessible to the public in general.\nHow it will work\nHere is a detailed breakdown of how it will work: first it will be free for everyone. Other than regular transaction fees on the blockchain itself, no one has to pay commissions nor fees. There's no account creation required anywhere and it works as a straight \"wallet to wallet\" solution:\n\nThe free commerce server allows multiple sellers and doesn't have anyone's private key.\nAt no point the app server should have access to anyone's funds, even if temporarily.\nTo enable payments with any cardano token, sellers will provide their public root key. Not the private key.\nThat root key will be used to generate new receiving addresses on demand.\nEvery receiving address will be unique. We generate shelley receiving addresses like what daedalus gives out.\nWhen a customer of a store makes a purchase, a new receiving address will be generated from the public root key and associated with an order.\nWhen someone sends a native asset or ADA to a payment address, the store owner will receive the funds directly in their wallet, to which the server has no access (we don't know and don't want to know the private key)\nOnce the total amount of the order is paid to the receiving address, the order is fulfilled.\nWith one receiving address per order we are able to determine that X amount was sent to that particular receiving address, instead of mixing funds with the whole balance of the wallet managed by the store.\nThis also maintains privacy of the online store as one customer won't be able to see other payments the store received.\nIn short, our solution works as a mere observer of transactions made from one or more (customer) addresses to another from the store owner (associated with an online purchase). Funds go straight to the shop owner wallet.\nAny online store/app should be able to run their own free commerce server independently of us or anyone else, or can use a free commerce server instance hosted by a third party.\nWhat we already did\nHere is a video update on the developments already made to process online payments using cardano on Shopify (NOTE: this proposal is NOT about shopify, the video is an example of what can be accomplished):\n\nMILESTONES\n(Month 1) - deliver wallet-like software solution that will enable sellers to generate \"shop\" wallets and export public root keys to generate payment addresses for them. Once payments are received, it will display such payments and all details associated with them (products/services purchased, etc)\n(Month 2) - A basic free commerce server with endpoints that enable the integration with a basic sales workflow for online stores who want to test it. It will be updated frequently to incorporate adjustments and more features.\n(Month 3) - Refinements to provide better integration with apps/online stores\n(Month 4) - Free commerce server release. We'll run a public server for any app or online store with no cost added. Developers should be able integrate cardano payments into their software and start using our service without any server setup.\n(Month 5 onward) - maintenance, monitoring and adjustments as required.\nIP/Copyright\nThe entire source code of this project will be available on github under the GPL v2.0 license.\nFUTURE PLANS\nEverything we are doing here is planned to allow for easy introduction of new capabilities. The work here will later enable online payments in e-commerce platforms such as Shopify and Woocommerce - to which we will submit proposals in the future.\nRISK\n\n\nI'm counting on earning additional funding from fees collected by the SHOP stake pool, especially to keep the project going after the first year.\nI've tried to minimize risk by already coding an initial prototype version the proves the service backend can work and can be integrated into online stores\nStore owners who intend to use this integration must be aware of their local legislation regarding the usage of crypto for the exchange of goods.\nConsumers of stores who sell goods for ADA must be aware of the risks associated with transacting with crypto currencies - there is little to no recourse in case of fraud. Transactions can't be reversed and funds can't be seized. This can be minimized if consumers purchase from reputable stores.\nMETRICS\nCode activity can be measured from the commits on these two github projects:\nhttps://github.com/uniVocity/envlp-cardano-wallet (ready for production as a wallet backend)\nhttps://github.com/uniVocity/envlp (user interface being built on top of envlp-cardano-wallet)\nThe projects can be compiled and deployed by anyone interested in seeing how the software is working at any point during development. We will provide step by step documentation on how to build, run and test everything independently.\nOnce the free commerce service is available to software developers, we can obtain reports and feedback from businesses that are using the integration and trying to enable cardano payments.\nACTIVITY BREAKDOWN:\n(A) Sales database setup: allow registering order, product and customer information from multiple apps and stores which can run on multiple platforms. We want to reuse the same back-end to process sales for multiple online stores.\n(B) Back-end processing: e-mail sending, QR code generation, tracking of pending orders and corresponding payment addresses, conversion of dollar amount to ADA & native tokens (from multiple sources), handling expiration of orders that are not paid within a given timeframe, process discounts, handling partial payments and overpayments\n(C) Back-end integration with cardano-db-sync: create database triggers and other functions to broadcast updates in real time from the blockchain to and capture payments to addresses associated with open orders created by each store.\n(D) Store wallet development: upload public root keys to online store from within the wallet. Pull order/customer/product information fom the online store associated with each transaction in the owner wallet. Implement support for sending and receiving money like a regular wallet\n(E) Build/deployment: produce scripts that produce self-contained packages ready for deployment to the servers who will run this integration (also making it easier for others to deploy and run this in their own servers)\n(F) Documentation: document the source code and write tutorials with the steps required for others to extend, build and deploy this solution independently. This is documentation for other developers to refer to when trying to understand the software.\nCOST: $75/hour * 20 days/month * 5 months * 7 hours/day = 52,500\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350766-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nOVERVIEW\nThe Wallet Name System is our proposal to build a backend service, comprised of a decentralized network of servers that communicate with the cardano blockchain to register and query details associated with wallet addresses used in cardano and any other blockchain - it works like the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) but for wallets.\n\n \n\nSoftware developers will be able to build applications that query any WNS server to obtain registered names and associated wallets. Basically each WNS server will have a webservice exposed to the internet for the general public, and any software will be able to query/update the WNS global address book anonymously.\n\n \n\nThis is NOT an end user facing system. A WNS server can be run by anyone able to run a server (like a stake pool) to expose public or private webservices that allow querying and registration. It can also be imported as a library software developers can build on top of.\n\n \n\nThis video presentation explains the details:\n\n\n \n\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nEssentially WNS servers will use the cardano blockchain to allow any cryptocurrency user to assign human readable names and associated information (such as email, phone, business addresses, etc) to their wallets: if you own multiple wallets, for multiple cryptocurrencies, all of them would be accessible under your registered name.\nThe basic functions of this system revolve around a simple API which allows:\n\nwallet owners to register their details with their preferred WNS provider\n\n \n\nusers and application developers to query all names and associated information registered, to obtain the corresponding wallet addresses for a given blockchain\n\n \n\nThe idea is to support applications, such as wallets, to enable their users to query payees by name and transfer funds to the wallet assigned to that name.\n\n \n\nHow it will work:\n\n \n\nFor example, you can assign \"John\" to a wallet address, and then other people can send money to \"John\" without having to know what is his current wallet. John can update his details at will.\n\n \n\nConstraints can be assigned to addresses so wallets and software that uses this service can notify users that they are sending insufficient funds for example.\n\n \n\nAll registrations are transactions on the cardano blockchain, so all WNS server providers will be able to see all registrations made by other WNS servers.\n\n \n\nA WNS can curate addresses and mark them as potential scam addresses. Using the earlier example, if John is a scammer, users can be notified that they are sending funds to a scam address.\n\n \n\nLastly, a WNS can accept the registration of wallet addresses of any blockchain. We want to incentivize other blockchains to interact with cardano through the utility we provide as an ecosystem.\n\n \n\nEXPECTATIONS\n\n \n\nOur goal is to provide a super simple to use server infrastructure that leverages the cardano blockchain, and to provide an open API that makes the life of software developers incredibly easy. For end users, it will be cheap and with no recurring costs to keep their registration available - you only pay a minimum of 1 ADA per registration or update plus transaction fees.\n\n \n\nWe will build the server infrastructure code which WNS providers can run, plus client libraries to facilitate the interaction with the webservices it provides. Everything will be open-sourced. We will also build registration and query pages that can be used as the basis to help other WNS operators to build their own independent registration websites.\n\n \n\nIP/COPYRIGHT\n\n \n\nThe entire source code of this project will be available on github under the GPL V2.0 license and we hope other community developers can build on top of this to create even better solutions in the future.\n\n \n\nPROPOSED LAUNCH\n\n \n\nWithin 5 months\n\n \n\nPROJECT SUSTAINABILITY\n\n \n\nAnyone can run their own WNS server and we plan to run a WNS ourselves. We'll build a registration website for our WNS and allow end users register their details through that. The registration fees collected should help to keep our operation going.\n\n \n\nWe also run the SHOP stake pool and use the rewards to help funding our development efforts for cardano.\n\n \n\nMETRICS\n\n \n\nCode activity can be measured from commits on github.\n\n \n\nCOMPETITION\n\n \n\nThere are other projects around which attempt to address the same problem, but none of these allow you register more than a name and a wallet and the cost is high. Also none provide an open querying API that anyone can use to find names and addresses for any given blockchain. What's out there are very limited solutions compared to what we are proposing to build. FIO, for example, uses its own blockchain, and it charges recurring fees for renewals. UnstoppableDomains is another similar solution which is expensive and as centralized as it can get.\n\n \n\nOur proposal aims to build a decentralized and accessible infrastructure for software developers. Multiple clones of UnstoppableDomains and other such services can be created on top of the WNS network.\n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n \n\n* Build the global address book structure: this involves defining metadata structure used to register and query names with associated addresses effectively. That metadata is stored on the cardano blockchain. Each WNS server has their own address book. The address books of all WNS servers are grouped together to form the \"global\" address book state. This \"global\" state is kept by all running servers - every WNS has the same state and knows all names in all address books.\n* Build the global WNS server registry: every WNS server has to register itself in the cardano blockchain. This registration will be used by all other WNS servers to discover each other and their corresponding address books\n* Handle issues around duplicate name registration concurrently, updates, transfers, etc\n* Support active synchronization of the global address book\n* Build endpoints for querying, registering and updating details associated with names\n\n \n\n* Support caching or registered names for efficient querying - this also comes with cache synchronization, invalidation, etc\n* Support address flagging mechanisms that allow reporting scam addresses.\n* Implement validations for address formats used in other blockchains - we want the WNS infrastructure to be usable by everyone, not only cardano.\n* Build the WNS server executable that any interested pary can download and run\n* Build libraries to enable software developers to easily create software against to interact with the services - developers can host their own WNS server or use a trusted server.\n* Build a basic web interface to enable querying and registration via browser for ease of use and testing\n* Setup a test cardano blockchain that can run on the desktop and be used by developers to build their software against a WNS connected to that without any additional cost or dependency on external services/testnets.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCOST: $75/hour * 20 days/month * 5 months * 7 hours/day = 52,500","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350761-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis can be created as a centralized service and migrated to a smart contract based solution afterwards.

We want to make a library that will simplify this process and allow even novice web developers to write their own applications, such as lightweight wallets, marketplaces, simple explorers, and more.\n\nAll you need to do is specify the endpoint (for example, there are already saas services that provide this graphql api, dandelion.link or blockfrost.io), and call the necessary methods to get the data - and the library will do the rest.\n\n \n\nEXPLANATION\n\nCardano-graphql is a tool that allows to get data from a database which is collected from blockchain data. In other words, it is the API for the Cardano blockchain node - here we can get raw data about the network status, addresses, pools, and everything else that is stored in the Cardano blockchain. We can also send transactions through this layer. It is being developed by the Cardano team.\n\nCardano-serialization-lib is a low-level library that allows to generate cryptographic entities for Cardano - mnemonics, private and public keys, staking keys, certificates, addresses, and hashing it all.\n\nError handling, getting addresses data from the blockchain, managing UTXOs inputs and outputs to build a transaction - this is a very large part of the work in each application - all that will be in our library, which will lower the entry threshold for Javascript developers to develop applications communicating with the Cardano blockchain.\n\nOur task is to write a wrapper that hides all this magic under the hood - the developer will need to initialize the library, specify the graphql endpoint and use documented methods that will make working with the blockchain easy.\n\n \n\nCODE EXAMPLE (DEMO)\n\ncardano-ray implementation: https://pastebin.com/z3tPkSpU\nwithout cardano-ray: https://pastebin.com/cYz6xpG8\n\n \n\nTEAM EXPERTISE\n\nTeam lead: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicktabolich/.\n\nWe are a small team of javascript developers, doing full-cycle integration of various web systems for clients from all over the world. We are also developing our own product - https://visualbuilder.cloud.\n\nWe've been experimenting with the Plutus Platform for a few months now, and we also participate in the Plutus Pioneer Program. We are also actively developing a multifunctional wallet for Cardano - RAY Wallet.\n\nThere are currently two developers working on the project and we are looking for funding to expand the team.\n\n \n\nHOW PROPOSAL IMPACTS THE CHALLENGE\n\nThis will significantly lower the entry level of JS developers to develop applications on Cardano.

As this is not a high-frequency strategy a portfolio rebalancing can be set in response to events, change in market conditions, or even based on the clock (for instance majority of indices rebalance on the 3rd week of each month and usually outperform most of the individual investors);\n- ensemble - technical term of combination of algorithms (usually in machine learning) and the method which takes output from multiple components and generates one uniform answer based on the individual answers; often ensemble algorithms perform better than single instances, due to better generalization and ability to capture multiple local minimum, and avoid catastrophically wrong predictions (let's assume one of the combined algos give absurdly bad answer); furthermore, in the case of trading, ensemble allows to encapsulate different trading strategies and take the democratic vote on what path to follow;\n- democratic - we use this word in a very overloaded sense:\n.... - democratic - open to everyone around the world to participate; hedge funds lack transparency, it takes time to exit (usually a couple months, but sometimes longer to get your money back), and most importantly you don't have to have over $250K or even more to be considered a client. You can invest any amount and receive revenue proportional to your initial investment;\n.... - Democractic - in the algorithmic sense; ensemble method will mirror trades of K=100 traders and ensemble model will take democratic vote based on different modelling techniques of understanding why certain traders take certain positions and weight it democratically (ensemble voting mechanism) which might affect both sizes of the positions or if to enter it or not.\n\n \n\nWhy do we need algorithmic trading on the blockchain?\n\nThere are 3 classical ways in which one can invest their cryptocurrencies at the moment:\n- lend it and receive share of the revenue (e.g. via BlockFi);\n- stake it (possible only on PoS blockchains) and receive share of the mined rewards;\n- provide liquidity via one of DeFi platforms (such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap) in usually very volatile pairs being exposed to significant impermanent loss.\n\n \n\nThis leaves the whole area of automatic trading untapped. As automated trading can be done in much more stable instruments it usually has lower risks than lending or providing liquidity. At the same time it can tap into the profits from either market inefficiencies, superior access or understanding of the market data.\n\n \n\nBlockchain as investment infrastructure creates access to much more fair wealth distribution. Consider when the government prints fiat money they spend it on something, but wouldn't it be more fair to distribute the minted currency to fiat currency holders? It'd stimulate the economy the same, one could argue that even more, but at the same time, the printing process wouldn't empower the fiat currency holders. It's in a sense, non-voluntary wealth transfer. One could argue that PoS blockchain addresses it by rewarding cryptocurrency holders.\n\n \n\nThe same happens in trading. The classical exchange has seen an insane level of optimization with first the shortest possible fibre optic cable link between Chicago and New York to facilitate high-frequency trading being replaced by microwave towers. The same happens in the hedge fund world - all hedge funds have advantageous access to exchanges, brokers, market information, and news information. As a result, sophisticated trading platforms such as market making and hedge funds are only available to rich investors with the usual arrangement of 2% of funds charged and 20% of profits as the cost of participating in the hedge fund.\n\n \n\nIn our view, it creates unfair advantages for the wealthy, where not only they have an advantage of resources, but also the advantage of how much more revenue those resources can generate. We believe that's an area that deserves fair and democratic access.\n\n \n\nFinally, quantitative finance, trading, information gathering and analysis, and so much more, are fascinating fields of knowledge, and when it's all used behind closed doors, in environment where it cannot be shared with the outside world, it creates a lot of friction and challenge in people acquiring the relevant knowledge, experience, and pushing the frontiers of science. It's exciting to see how many innovative and beautifully simple ideas crypto space already came up with such as Automatic Market Making or Quadratic Funding.\n\n \n\nProposed solution\nDevelop an automated trading algorithm taking into the account K=100 top traders which transactions we want to take as the input. Have an ensemble of algorithms analyse this input and produce the voted score of what positions to enter.\n\n \n\nThe ensemble would be composed of different types of algorithms from market indicators, to risk assessment, to advanced quantitative models, and be then input to the ensemble assessing plutocrically (via vote, stake, and algorithm expertise, and recent performance), what's the optimal basket composition, computing the expected execution cost, adjusting the trades for the cost of execution, and rebalancing the portfolio.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nTimeline\nLaunchpad\nWe plan 3 phase launch:\n- (late summer) develop first complete ensemble trading algorithm with the oracle source of trading information; stable platform with UI and backtesting data; perform backtesting on a simulated input source (mirror market, but execute paper trades on testnet);\n- (late autumn) develop first game theoretically sound mainnet testing ensemble algorithm; assign real trading money ($10k portion of the proposal) and capture the performance in action; evaluate and iterate; publish algo performance;\n- (early winter) completed solution with live tracked algo decisions, indicators, and strategy performance; open to everyone to stake in the strategy.\n\n \n\n \n\nDefinition of Success\n\n \n\nAfter 3 months\n- Ensemble algorithm performing paper trades on Cardano testnet.\n- Tracked monitoring and algo performance (Grafana or customized).\n\n \n\nAfter 6 months\n- Mainnet (real-world) ready and game theoretically sound algo;\n- Perform, monitor, and iterative on the algo trading with real money;\n- Wrap up trading report and publish to the community;\n- Improve the interface and start mainnet integration for the user interaction.\n\n \n\nAfter 12 months\n- Ensemble trading algorithm generating risk-free alpha compared to indicator created of top 10 crypto by their capitazaliton.\n- Users are able to view algo decisions in real life and all historical data from performance to input and trades.\n- Everyone able to stake into the algo.\n- Liquid unstaking (as the fund is involved in the actual positions unstaking means either returning basket or converting all cryptos to the input currency, e.g. ADA), we want to provide integration with swap smart contracts and visibility to exchange costs, and options to unstake.\n\n \n\nImpact on the challenge metrics\n\nSource: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/25941\n\n \n\nDeFi (liquidity providing and farming) applications attract enormous amounts of users and monetary value: https://dappradar.com/defi.\n\n \n\nThis project is competing for the same market as DeFi projects.\n\n \n\nDeFi (liquidity providing and farming) applications attract enormous amounts of users and monetary value: https://dappradar.com/defi.\n\n \n\nPancakeSwap which launched just on September 20, 2020 already amassed (source: https://dappradar.com/binance-smart-chain/defi/pancakeswap):\n- 579.23k monthly active users;\n- 2.93M monthly transactions;\n- $30.64B in traded volume; and\n- $4.08B in total value locked.\n\n \n\nA good automatic trading algorithm can potentially generate better returns or returns less risk, hence incentivizing DeFi users to stake into the automated trading algos as compared to yield farming.\n\n \n\nWe project, if successful, in a year, it could\n- Attract about 1-10k new users; specifically to Cardano from other blockchains as it's very unlikely other blockchains will be that quick to catch on this innovation.\n- As any actively traded basket of instruments the fund itself will generate significant transaction movement on the blockchain. We estimate that about 5-50% of the total value locked in the strat will be moved into other positions on average every day. Assuming that total value locked is ₳20M, it'd generate anywhere from ₳0.1M to ₳10M of daily trading volume.\n- If executed correctly, it has the right to add a building block to Cardano as being the financial operating system. Contributing positively to the Cardano's long term vision of being a financial operating system.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n- Implement API integration with the major centralised exchanges that allow traders profiles to be public (Binance, CoinBase, etc.).\n- Scrape API and any other source for historical data create a database of trader performances.\n- Research and implement a series of trader scoring metrics. In the most simple terms, the metric should at least take into account P&L and risk into the account. Some traders engage in very risky options and derivative trading which might lead to incredible profits, but equivalently to incredible losses, and we want to maximize profits up to the certain risk profile we're willing to take. Additionally, the trades should be evaluated in terms of VAR (Value at Risk), Extreme Event Modeling, and existing history of the performance of the asset (e.g. a very new asset will be extremely volatile and not enough data will exist to properly describe their risk profiles).\n- Create a bunch of dozen top K=100 trader profiles by a series of scoring metrics (we want traders who have consistent gains and not one big win to start with, but as we develop ensemble models we might want to add a few outliers into the ensemble model). Those models will be used to backtest ensemble trading strategies and benchmark them against each other.\n- Research and experiment with building ensemble components (we can use different actor models to model different trader profiles or combine multiple agent models with the trader parametrization). Experiment with different ensemble parametrization. Note the ensemble model tuning parameters, and prepare for backtesting.\n- Develop a trading benchmark. Our assumption is that a good ensemble trader should be able to outperform the cryptomarket index fund. There isn't a cryptomarket index fund, so we'll create one based on top 100 cryptocurrencies by capitalization for the last 5 years. This in turn will become a bottom benchmark for the fund returns. Bitcoin on the other hand will be used as a benchmark for the risk-free return rate (interest rate in the regular investment world). Technically, it's very different, but again, we want to outperform the crypto market and not the classical market, hence it has logic to it, plus it's much higher bar than simple risk-free rate.\n- Perform backtesting using different source of data:\n.... - Historical market data;\n.... - Monte Carlo simulations (Generalized Brownian Motion - random walk as a source of randomness using the crypto asset parameters), repeated many times over resulting in different paths\n.... - Historical market data and Monte Carlo simulation, but with extreme events introduced to test the strategy resilience to ruin.\n- Create a report explaining the methodology, the ensemble model training process, and performance on the historical data, in Montecarlo simulation, and with and without black swan events introduction.\n- Introduce the time step parameter - how often the ensemble model rebalances the portfolio and include the slippage and transaction cost into the model.\n- Rerun all experiments taking into account execution costs.\n- Research and design trustless custody system (security of funds insured by contract) and different staking/unstaking models. We plan on contributing equities to the fund via stable currency which then is transformed into the strategy stake tokens (as the fund value increases or decreases it will represent the returns on investment). As majority if not all funds might be invested we need to consider what's the most optimal strategy for unstaking, worst case scenario it can be performed on each clock action (before rebalancing return staked assets or staked exchanged for stable currency / Cardano / Bitcoin) for the equivalent token amount.\n- When Cardano testnet launches, start experimenting with liquidity provider integrations and token value translation mechanisms.\n- Mint native Cardano token representing this specific strategy (ensemble top 100 traders), use a portion of collected funds to inject the algo, and test on the real market. If successful, show the real market history on top of all the above research, and create a liquidity pair on Cardano DEXes for people to be able to purchase tokens at the market value. If slippage on DEX might introduce too much value lose, experiment with smart contract which computes the fund ratio allocation and returns token proportionate based on that when interacting with it, skipping DEXes, and removing risk of slippage, or inefficient market pricing if LP would be too illiquid (if there's a strong imbalance between makers and takers for the LP it will create a price arbitrage which hopefully would be used by savvy trader to execute on the arbitrage, but in our opinion it's better to protect the fund value leakage due to DEX inefficiencies).\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nReferences\n\n \n\nFundamentals\n[0] Options Volatility & Pricing.

The exact numbers are hard to predict and we did our best to approximate costs based on our prior development experience.\n\n---\n\nBelow is the detailed description, but we really recommend to view it on Google Docs that support richer formatting and equations, which will give you much better reading experience, plus linked table of contents, and many of the references.\n**Google Docs URL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9UjN53Hq9FZL7JZ5DQQZLD8yNWB4BNcG4blWYK7Pt8**\n\n---\n\n \n\nDaemon Exchange\n\nFirst in the world comprehensive crypto decentralized exchange providing access to liquidity providing (AMM), yield farming, crypto indexes, mirrored crypto assets, derivative trading, option trading strategies structured via smart contracts, and more.\nThe future of financial markets is on the blockchain and we believe that Cardano is the best blockchain to build it upon.\n\n \n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\nNext to lending and staking liquidity providing (LP) is 3rd reliable revenue stream available to the users of Ethereum and Binance smart chains via platforms such as UniSwap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap, and many others.\n\nLiquidity providing while potentially a great source of revenue (typically in the range of 20-500% APY) has a different risk profile (impermanent loss, price discovery, etc.), and is just one of many fundamental building blocks of decentralized finance.\nWe propose development of all-inclusive decentralized exchange solution giving users access to\n- Decentralized market making; both as makers (liquidity providers) and takers (people exchange tokens and coins on the platform);\n- Blockchain-agnostic decentralized market making, capitalizing and contributing to the Cardano's goal of integration with other blockchains, becoming the first exchange that has as wide offering (if not larger) than the top centralized exchanges;\n- Mirrored (synthetic) instruments giving ability to the wide range of long/short term future contracts, and trading assets not native to the blockchain (such as mirroring stocks);\n- Basket trading (provision of crypto indexes and in the future ability for the users to create own baskets via Oracle mechanism and the choice of rebalancing method);\n- And building the future of decentralized crypto finance on top of it, in forms of automated hedge funds, giving people access to staking in algorithms, bots, and hedge fund strategies.\n\n \n\nBeside the simple answer of giving people access to more ways of realizing profits, we believe those are fundamentally important challenges to address. Most importantly, any market that only allows entering long positions will be inadvertently very inefficient; we believe that introduction of sound financial instruments (indexes, shorts, derivatives, etc.) will lead to increasing efficiency of crypto markets and reduction of volatility. Furthermore, it will open the gates to the future innovation and development of the next layer of the financial ecosystem. Finally, while in the classical financial world, investment vehicles such as hedge funds, leverage, market execution are disproportionately accessible to rich and usually completely beyond even the grasp of regular folk, the decentralized nature of all the solutions will give much more symmetrical access to both the information and trading tools to everyone.\n\n \n\nInterested? We invite you to read more and to join the decentralized financial revolution 😈\n\nWhy Cardano?\n\nWe believe that a sound financial system needs to be built on a sound blockchain. Cardano addresses many shortcomings of so-called gen 2 blockchains (such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain) from fees, through network scalability (via Hydra) and governance (Voltaire and the Catalyst project), and having one of the most sound communities (critical, no or very little FUD and FOMO), to having the power of Haskell, Plutus, and formal verification behind it.\n\n \n\nLast but not least, a small personal note, Haskell has to be one of the most enjoyable programming languages for building the future financial system [FUN.0]. Financial derivatives have everything in the name, they derive all the properties from the underlying asset. When you consider functional programming composability, verbose type systems, and being built upon category theory, you see the natural beauty of deriving the financial system as you'd be computing a derivative of an equation. It works for everything from formulas, through contracts, to generating new ideas.\n\n \n\nWhy anonymous?\n\nBefore getting into the details, we want to answer one question upfront. We submit the project anonymously and plan to continue development as such. However, there's a very good reason behind our choice, and you'd hear it and put it in the perspective of other projects.\n\n \n\nCryptocurrency is strongly under regulated and is likely to undergo very rapid regulation over the next few years. Furthermore, the innate decentralized nature of blockchains and no governing entity (other than Decentralized Autonomous Organization - DAO) makes it extremely even ambiguous as to what regulations to follow (some lawmakers base regulations on where the users are and some where the platform is). Last but not least, any development team having access to smart contracts is prone to the oldest computer exploit in the world - the so-called wrench attack (or rubber-hose cryptanalysis) [SEC.0].\nAs such each project going fully public with their whole team either accepts the associated attack risks which very likely will severely limit their ability to innovate to the regulated areas or are simply unaware and ignoring the very real risks to both the projects they are working on and themselves.\n\n \n\nWe'd be happy to confirm our identities and credentials via a secure escrow service. … and we're well experienced in the area having build and lead front-office teams in #1 market making and financial institutions in the world, plus having formal education in informatics and quantitative finance.\n\n \n\nOur goal is to follow regulations whenever possible and regulate as soon as the guidance is available. … and there's nothing better than going out publicly and taking credit for your work. However, we believe that it's a much better choice for the project to be developed in this manner.\n\n \n\nFinally, we believe that any financial system and institution shouldn't derive its trust from its brand, but rather from the public code, audit, and build track of performance, transparency, and guiding principles.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nProposition\n\nDevelop all-in-one market making platform composed of\n\n- Decentralized exchange (DEX);\n- Liquidity providing (LP) and farming solution with innovative curve solutions;\n- Bridges to all crypto assets, providing one place for trading assets native not only to Cardano blockchain;\n- Crypto indexes;\n- Crypto financial derivatives (covered options, shorts/calls, etc.);\n- Mirrored (synthetic) instruments allowing trading non-blockchain native assets (e.g. stocks) and providing additional ways of creating inverted instruments and financial derivatives (via collateral);\n- Develop educational materials and access to data and indicators decreasing information asymmetry and helping people make more informed investment decisions.\n\nPurpose\n\n- Provide sound and efficient way of investing;\n\n- Increase market efficiency;\n\n- Build the foundation for the future of financial markets.\n\nPurpose in detail…\n\nProvide sound and efficient way of investing\n\nSound in the sense of well developed, with auditable code, information symmetry (indicators provided for the traded instruments and downloadable historical data), education content giving everyone ability to understand not only profits, but also risk exposure. Also sound in the selection of used techniques, e.g. in liquidity providing from tight spread market making, to similar instrument liquidity pools, and more.\n\n \n\nEfficient in the sense of high return on liquidity provided via automated market making and liquidity farming from token liquidity pools to synthetic instruments and derivatives. Efficient in the sense of high liquidity meaning low slippage and predictable executions.\n\n \n\nIncrease market efficiency\n\nMarkets that cannot be shorted are inadvertently inefficient [PHIL.0, MM.0, MM.1]. This is a simple consequence of the fact that a person that believes that asset X is undervalued can buy it and hold it until the price discovery catches on, while the person convicted that the asset is overpriced cannot take a separate position (short). The person who believes asset X to be overpriced cannot simply sell it as it only protects them from the downside risk, but doesn't provide a way to capitalize on their knowledge of the asset overvaluation. In the result, there is very little incentive for discovering overpriced assets, but there's one for undervalued ones. If you can only add water to a jug, but never take away, the amount of water will inadvertently only increase. It can be even stipulated that a lot of volatility in the crypto market takes origin in this mechanic, due to lack of sufficient access to short instruments the price tends to go up getting to the point when it suddenly reverts to the mean, like stretched rubber bands to its limits.\n\nDeveloping a sound system composed of all types of financial instruments, most importantly, negatively correlated ones will lead to the increased market efficiency and drive it closer towards the equilibrium.\n\nBuild the foundation for the future of financial markets\n\nLast, but not least, having a trading platform with a wide access to tradeable crypto assets, indexes, derivatives, and mirrored assets, will allow for the development of more specialized financial platforms on top of this infrastructure layer. One example of such a layer would be the creation of the first distributed hedge fund in the world allowing to stake investments in automatic trading strategies and in bots giving exposure to people in the wide to additional source of alpha (additional revenue compared to index without taking additional risk).\n\nYou can explore the idea behind the first decentralized hedge fund (and specifically one algo) at our other Catalyst fund application: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Democratised-AlgoTrading-on-Cardano/352830-48088 .\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nDecentralized Exchange\n\nOne stop shop for liquidity providing, yield farming, minting, burning, and trading synthetic assets, option, and option strategies minting and trading, access to educational resources, and source of market data (indicators of all the assets and dump of the trading data).\n\n \n\n---\n\nLiquidity Providing\n\nLiquidity providing, a.k.a. market making, is a process of providing both sides of a trade:\n\n- Buy and sell around the spread (spread is usually the mean price and spread is the distance from that mean) for single instruments;\n- Exchange pair (most common example among DeFi) where the market maker provides two assets X and Y, constituting the trading pair and where the taker has to provide X to receive Y and Y to receive X according to the current price. This solution is popular among DeFi as allows for mathematically sound staking using one of LP formulas such as the famous x * y = k (where the x * y has to always equal to the total value of the liquidity pool); this gave the rise to popular automated market making (AMM) concept in crypto. The main disadvantage of this solution is weak price discovery (often the reason for AMM being called the trader of the last resort) and the pairs often being composed of one very liquid token (e.g. usually BNB for BSC and ETH for Ethereum) and one usually illiquid (or even not-so-sound token). This allows for generating high LP returns, but exposes the market maker (the platform user) in this case to high potential impermanent loss when the general market exits the not-so-sound token.\n- Complex arrangement such as sharing liquid assets among many other pools or staking into pools of similar asset class, e.g. exchanging one DeFi token for another.\nWe propose to deliver x * y = k AMM with liquidity farming rewards upon the exchange launch on the mainnet and continue development and research in the area of curve models for liquidity providing, better price discovery mechanisms, and other LP providing arrangements from spread based, to how the actual pools are composed (and of how many assets).\nLiquidity providers will earn the 0.2% out of the total 0.3% transaction fee redistributed directly as increase in the amount of LP tokens held.\n\n \n\n---\n\nLiquidity Mining\n\nLiquidity mining a.k.a. yield farming is additional reward to the liquidity providers in the form of a platform native tokens often also providing governance functionality in the platform. We plan on stable policy the exchange platform governance tokens minting and distribution to liquidity providers as a form of additional reward. Further, we pledge to use a large portion of the platform income to repurchase tokens out of the market and burn them to maintain upward price pressure. This is exactly the same mechanics as implemented by PancakeSwap.\n\nTokens are usually allocated based on the total pools volume and multipliers. A platform might use multipliers to reward liquidity providers in illiquid pairs to further incentivize them for taking the extra risk (and hence also indirectly increase the liquidity for exchange pairs on the platform).\n\n \n\n---\n\nBlockchain Bridges\n\nPlatform bridges to other blockchains and interaction with other blockchain smart contracts has two main objectives:\n\nIncrease the market efficiency by bridging different ecosystems and allowing for simple arbitrage on any assets (regardless of blockchain);\nIncrease the availability of coins and tokens on Daemon Exchange, becoming all in one exchange for all crypto assets, and allowing for construction of more sound financial derivatives (primarily when concerned with crypto indexes and synthetic instruments).\nAbility to integrate with other blockchain smart contracts as already in scope EVM via Cardano's KEVM project will allow for direct (Plutus / KVM) smart contract to (Solidity / EVM) smart contract integration.\n\n \n\n---\n\nCrypto Indexes\n\nAn index is a financial instrument representing a basket of instruments allowing to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way [LP.3]. As such it allows you to invest into the entire market, market sector, or a group of similar assets.\n\n \n\nThe main advantage of holding index as compared to single crypto assets is that they often guarantee much more stable returns, at the efficient market rate, without too much risk exposure. Take for instance smart contract blockchain, one instead of placing all bets on one horse or spreading bets according to their own metric might buy shares of smart contract top 20 index giving exposure to the entire smart contract market with allocation to specific assets correlated to market capitalization. As such investors are betting on smart contracts being successful overall rather than any specific project.\n\n \n\nGood example of a similar project from Ethereum blockchain is TokenSet which provide indexes for a range of Ethereum blockchain tokens, e.g. DeFi pulse index: https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi. In this case, trader buys a stake of the index that represents the market composition by the capitalization for the specific group of assets (e.g. top 100 cryptocurrencies, top 25 DeFis, top 10 smart chain cryptos, etc.); the index is rebalanced at a constant interval (typically 3rd week of every month) and maintains specific index properties (e.g. in the case of TokenSet they limit max position to 25%).\n\n \n\nAsset prices and market capitalizations at the time of rebalancing would be ingested from https://coinmarketcap.com/, https://www.coingecko.com/en (similar to TokenSet that takes those 2 as their source of information).\n\n \n\nThe index rebalancing can be achieved with one of many existing centralized price Oracles and the typical index rebalancing of every 3rd week of the month.\n\n \n\nFurther, CoinGecko tracks many different asset classes which is a great inspiration for potential index creation. As such, we propose development of the below crypto indexes:\n\n- Top 50 crypto;\n- Top 25 DeFi;\n- Top 20 smart contract blockchains;\n- Top 25 oracles, etc.;\n- Top 25 specialized application blockchains (storage chains such as FileCoin or ARWeave or coverage networks such as HNT), etc.\n\n \n\nAn example of TokenSet DeFi index on the screenshot below alongside with the composition on 2021/04/27. The URL to the site: https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi.\n\n \n\n---\n\nMirrored (Synthetic) Instruments\n\nMirrored (a.k.a. synthetic) assets are financial instruments deriving their value from the underlying [SYN.2]. The underlying can be anything from real objects such as land, art, or gold ownership to abstract such as commodities, indexes, stocks, equities, and any existing financial instrument.\n\n \n\nThe name of this asset class is derived from their functionality, i.e. mirrored implies that the asset mirrors the price behavior of its underlying asset which can be simple 1-1, but also can represent inverted (short) where the price is followed in inverse (e.g. lose of $10k in the underlying value is gain of $10k in the inverted synthetic token). Synthetic on the other hand refers to a specific way of issuance of the mirrored tokens, namely by not backing it with the actual underlying assets, but rather providing collateral acting as insurance providing the guarantee of the price. That collateral can be auctioned at a discount to acquire back synthetic tokens and balance the value at risk requirement or liquidated at the margin being returned as collateral to the token owners.\n\n \n\nWe propose implementation of synthetic (i.e. backed by collateral) protocol allowing for\n- Minting synthetic tokens by providing the required collateral (in the range of 150-750% of the underlying value) [SYN.2, SYN.4];\n- Earning liquidity providing fees (proportionally rewarding volatile and illiquid synthetics);\n- Burning synthetic tokens in order to restore the collateral, acting both as arbitrage (price discovery mechanism) and a convenient way to exit synthetic position;\n- Trading synthetic instruments as first-class exchange citizens.\n\n \n\nIt's important to note few distinguishing characteristics of synthetic instruments that (often) make them more desirable to trade that the actual underlying instruments:\n\n- Fractional ownership: minted synthetic tokens can be fractionally traded giving access to them to low net worth individuals. Let's just as an example give a stock of Berkshire Hathaway worth at the 2021/04/27 market close $411,400.00. We strongly believe that creating frictionless market access gives much more fair access for financial betterment to everyone regardless of their total net worth.\n- Derivative financial instruments: synthetic tokens can use any formula to derive the price from the underlying asset, from a simple reversed token, where for the case of example, $10k loss in BTC price represents $10k gain in the reversed synthetic BTC token. This effectively provides an easy mechanism to trade short (capitalize on the knowledge of the asset being overpriced) and leads to creation of much more efficient markets. Further, derived instruments don't stop with reversed, but can be as well indexes, future contracts, options (deriving price from the Black-Scholes formula), and much more. Covered calls and puts are the easiest to implement using collateral.\n- Liquidity: some assets pose a challenge to trade, e.g. physical assets or illiquid ones; synthetic token issuance as it only reflects the price of physical commodities makes them easy to trade and in the case of illiquid assets injects additional liquidity to the system via the market making incentives proportional to the risk derived from the exoticity of the underlying asset.\n- No geographical boundaries: not everyone has equal access to financial markets from the brokerage requirements to some assets not being available to citizens of specific countries from restricted trading lists to actual market frictions. A permissionless blockchain provides a platform for deployment of assets available to everyone in the world and in combination with synthetic instruments it gives access to trading them to a much wider audience which in turn creates a more even field for all traders and injects additional liquidity into the market.\n- Low transaction costs: majority of financial instruments are available to low net worth individuals only via brokerage often charging significant fees for order execution and in the case of exchanges or market makers providing options to trade in fractional shares it always comes at a premium. The blockchain implementation both provides transparency of what liquidity fees are, creates peer to peer transaction network removing the intermediary and hence the cost, and provides much quicker settlement mechanics.\n\n \n\nSynthetic token interface:\n- Mint: provide collateral and the price oracle minting synthetic tokens.\n- Burn: return synthetic tokens, burn them, and receive the stake of collateral represented by them.\n- Trade: trade as any token on the blockchain.\n\n \n\nThe critical functionality of synthetic tokens is ingestion of asset price and evaluation if the provided collateral is sufficient. If it's not then either the synthetic tokens need to be repurchased at a premium using the collateral (which is similar to Maker's Collateralized Debt Position - CDP) or the contract must be liquidated [SYN.0, SYN.1, SYN.2, SYN.3, SYN.4].\nIt's worth to note that the risk can be shared among a pool of similar or even all synthetic instruments. The settlements would still reflect the price movements, but the risk can be collateralized for the system together, similar in the below example from Synthetix [SYN.4].\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nPlatform Governance Process and Tokens\n\nWe plan on release of the platform native tokens that will fulfill 2 roles:\n- Rewards in the LP token staking farms (similar to PancakeSwap);\n- Governance token used to vote on the development proposals for the platform (same as on UniSwap and PancakeSwap).\n\n \n\nThe implemented burn mechanics (from LP platform take off fees) and lottery on top of the token native functionality (governance) will provide a price foundation for the token (similar to PancakeSwap). The circulation control and a stable and consistent burn mechanics is paramount, where the platform portion of revenues is used to buy tokens and burn them maintaining the stable price point, or in the case of high burn pressure and platform popularity, might even drive it up.\nInterestingly, UniSwap token that only provides governance functionality has market capitalization of $21B and Cake token that is PancakeSwap native reward and governance token has a total market cap of $0.658B.\n\n \n\nWe'll aim to airdrop tokens to the early platform adopters and from then on provide it in the form of liquidity provider and educational content creators rewards.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nCrypto Derivatives\n\nIn this section we focus primarily on crypto options. However, we plan on adding descriptions of other derivatives that could be minted in similar fashion.\n\nOptions\n\nOptions contract is the right, but not the obligation, to buy (or sell) the underlying asset at a specific price at a specific time. Options are great instruments to increase the money making potential (as it allows the trader to take a larger exposure to the price movements in the market), allow for risk control by providing inversely correlated instruments (calls/puts), allow for structuring trades to bet on specific outcomes (e.g. take limited exposure to price increase via bull spread), and provide efficiency to the market.\n\n \n\nOptions are priced using Black-Scholes formula. Options derive their price from the assumption that market dynamics follow Generalized Brownian Motion and the underlying asset volatility, free interest rate, and the option parameters itself (type - call or put, strike price, the expiration date).\nCall option price C is defined as\n\n \n\nC=S_t * N(d1) - K * e^{-r * (T-t)} * N(d2)\n\n \n\nwhere\n- C- call option price;\n- N- CFD of the normal distribution;\n- S_t- current underlying price;\n- K - strike price;\n- r - risk-free interest rate (in the case of Cardano, this should be equal to the staking reward);\n- T - expiration date, where T-t is the time to expiry;\n- σ - volatility of the underlying asset;\n- d_1 = { ln(S_t/K) + (r + 0.5 * σ_v^2) * (T-t) } / { σ * sqrt(T-t) }\n- d_2 = d_1 - σ_s * sqrt(T-t)\n\n \n\nPut option price P is defined as\n\n \n\nP = K * e^{-r * (T-t)} * N(-d2) - S_t * N(-d1)\n\n \n\nwhere all symbols including d1and d2 are the same.\n\n \n\nWe propose two implementations of option contracts\n- Covered options where the option writer owns an equivalent amount of the underlying security. This means that the underlying is locked into the contract when the covered call option is minted. This provides the guarantee that the option can be exercised as per specification (according to the option type - European, American, Bermuda and the price oracle). For covered option creators it generates income in the form of options premium.\n- Collateralized option (synthetic instrument approach) where collateral is provided to hedge the underlying volatility to around 200% underlying value and be subject to collateral rebalancing.\n\nAdvantages of option trading on the blockchain\n\nUsually options are written by big institutions (e.g. banks or large market makers) and sold in bulks of option for 100 underlying shares each. This not only limits the liquidity and who issues the option contracts on the market, but also access to buying option contracts (as they need to be bought in bulk of 100s and they carry the corresponding risk with them). Not to mention, the cryptocurrency market is much more volatile than the stock market, and taking the same exposure doesn't make sense for a lot of crypto assets.\n\n \n\nTrading options on the blockchain provides 2 category of benefits - to the market by increasing its efficiency and the number of instruments that can be traded, structuring risk, and hedging, and to investors as doing so on the blockchain has a series of benefits:\n- No middle man - options are minted by people on the blockchain and available to everyone else on the blockchain, hence the execution fees are low, and the premium is only paid for the service provided by the writer and the risk that they take;\n- Fractional shares - options can be traded in much smaller units and even in fractions;\n- Cheaper settlement - settlement is automatic via smart contracts;\n- Full transparency as all the information is publicly available on the blockchain.\n\nOption trading strategies\n\nWe further propose composite smart contracts allowing purchase of option trading strategies. A user would select the risk and profit profile, input strategy parameters, and smart contract would automatically structure using the required composites for the strategy.\n\n \n\nThis adds a new innovative way of trading and makes option trading (usually very risky to novice) available in a risk controlled manner (outlying the risk at value, the best/worst potential outcomes, and for savvy trades just allows for easy locking option strategy).\n\n \n\nWe outline below a dozen of option trading strategies that we'd expect to introduce as a follow up to ability to trade options. This list should evolve in the future and additionally welcome new strategy propositions from the community as long as they're sound and the risk is easy to understand and display.\n\nBull Call Spread\n\nStructure:\n- Buy N calls, at strike price K1 with the expiration date T;\n- Sell N(the same number) calls, at strike price K2 where K2> K1, with expiration date T (the same expiration date).\n\n \n\nThis type of vertical spread is used when the investor is moderately bullish on the underlying asset and protects from the maximal potential loss, but also kaps the total profit if expired above the strike price K2.\n\nBear Put Spread\n\nStructure:\n- Buy N puts, at strike price K1 with the expiration date T;\n- Sell N(the same number) puts, at strike price K2 where K1> K2, with expiration date T (the same expiration date).\n\n \n\nSimilar to bull call spread, bear put spread is a tool for moderately bearish investors, who wants to protect against the upside risk, and accepts the potential limitation of the income if puts expires deeper into the money.\n\nLong Straddle\n\nStructure:\n- Buy N calls, at strike price K with the expiration date T;\n- Buy N puts, at strike price K with the expiration date T.\n\n \n\nLong straddle doesn't provide risk protection, however allows to bet on volatility, i.e. that the underlying will move significantly off the strike price K, but without knowing which direction.\n\nLong Strangle\n\nStructure:\n- Buy N out-of-the-money calls, at strike price K with the expiration date T;\n- Buy N out-of-the-money puts, at strike price K with the expiration date T.\n\n \n\nLong straddle doesn't provide risk protection, however allows to bet on volatility, i.e. that the underlying will move significantly off the strike price K, but without knowing which direction, and is efficient for betting on large price movements. This allows for betting on calendar events, e.g. the SEC lawsuit against XRP for the day on which the verdict is announced.\n\nOther Option Strategies\n\nThere are many other option trading strategies that can be structured from a simple call and put options, once those are available on the platform. We will provide the description on the below strategies and more in the short future (wrapping up here because of the Catalyst application timeline).\n\n \n\nTo mention a few other option strategies:\n- Short Straddle\n- Long Call Butterfly Spread\n- Barrier options\n- Long term option\n- Calendar (Time) Spread\n- Collars\n- Iron Condor\n- Iron Butterfly\n- Fig Leaf\n- Long Call spread\n- Long Put Spread\n- Short Call Spread\n- Short Put Spread\n- Double Diagonal\n.. and much more.\n\nFoundations for the Future of Distributed Financial Ecosystem\n\nFor first proper decentralized hedge funds which trading strategies could be staked like liquidity provider pairs, for first proper decentralized algorithmic trading that can provide a revenue fee to the author and the rest profits to the stakers, for complex trading strategies with well understood risk available to low net worth investors, we must build financial infrastructure first.\nDaemon Exchange's goal is to provide exactly this infrastructure and to allow for development of the next generation of investment vehicles known from the financial world on the blockchain accessible to people in the wide.\nFurther we believe that the way blockchain operates and the new idea it sparks will lead to financial revolution not only in the terms of democratization, but also in the ways we think about investing, and invest.\n\n \n\n---\n\nTimeline\n\nLaunchpad\n\nDaemon Exchange launch plan will follow closely the planned timeline of IOG to rollout Alonzo smart contracts onto testnet (late April / early May) and mainnet (July):\nDaemon Exchange will be rolled out in 3 main phases:\n- (early summer) Paper trading system on testnet;\n- (closely following smart contracts mainnet launch in July) Daemon Exchange providing swap and liquidity mining at launch on mainnet;\n- (steady pace continued development on the features listed in this document) Rolling out all other functionalities described in this document such as crypto indexes, futures, derivatives, synthetic (mirrored) instruments, and more.\n\n \n\nWe plan to launch paper trading [TR.0] on testnet in the early summer. The scope of paper trading will cover ADA faucet to seed each paper trading account with the initial ADA balance, and allow trading of testnet ADA for synthetic instruments following the price oracle. Synthetics will include inverse (short) tokens (e.g. iBTC price increases proportionally to the BTC price decrease and \"i\" stands for inverse BTC). We plan to provide synthetic tokens following the price of real assets for top 20-30 cryptos.\n\n \n\nAs all money on testnet isn't assigned real-world value, we can enforce synthetic price at the swap level, and use external oracle sources such as https://coingecko.com.\n\n \n\nPaper trading would give users access to\n- Faucet to seed the trading account with initial ADA amount (same for everyone);\n- Allow to swap any crypto currency for any other available on testnet via synthetics and their inverse;\n- Track the paper trading performance against other traders via wallet leaderboard.\nDaemon Exchange paper trading testnet has 2 main goals to fulfill:\n- Engage the community to explore the platform and have a safe paper trading environment for crypto, which is a great - educational resource, and will remain active, even after Daemon Exchange launching on the mainnet.\n- Test the platform in the real world scenario. There will be some significant differences between mainnet and testnet (paper trading) implementations and one has to take into the consideration, that testnet doesn't have incentives to exploit bad code (as cryptos on testnet don't represent real value), but still it will provide a test bed for many of the platform future functionalities.\n\n \n\nAs any financial system goes, testnet doesn't provide the ability to test all platform functionalities and potential vulnerabilities as the lack of financial incentives (testnet cryptos don't hold real value, hence don't provide incentives for arbitrage, gaming the system, finding exploits, or platform traffic that mainnet would have), hence there will be transition phase to mainnet once it gets smart contracts Alonzo update.\n\n \n\nWe plan the Daemon Exchange platform launch to follow as closely smart contract mainnet launch as possible, but if necessary, we want to be upfront about 2-4 weeks of required time after mainnet smart contract launch for testing and migration.\n\n \n\nDaemon Exchange mainnet launch will include at minimum the below functionalities:\n- Swapping ADA and Cardano blockchain tokens;\n- x * y = k liquidity pools;\n- Liquidity farming.\n\n \n\nFollowed by Daemon Exchange launch on the mainnet we'll follow with development and deployment of the rest of functionalities:\n- Bridges to other blockchains and wrapped tokens;\n- Crypto indexes;\n- Crypto synthetic and mirrored assets (starting with inverted tokens for the major liquidity pairs);\n- Crypto futures and derivatives.\n\n \n\nDepending on the platform and team growth we'd expect different timeline for the development timeline following the Daemon Exchange launch on the mainnet, but it's safe to assume that each item on the above list would take anywhere in the range of 3 months to launch and additional 3 more to fine tune.\n\n \n\nDefinition of Success\n\nAfter 3 months:\n\nDaemon Exchange paper trading launch on testnet providing the below functionalities:\n\n- Seeding trading wallet with initial supply of ADA from a faucet;\n- Synthetic tokens following top 20-30 cryptos via price oracle and their shorts/inverted synthetic tokens;\n- Paper traders leaderboard (by wallet address).\n\nAfter 6 months:\n\n- Daemon Exchange launch on mainnet with the below functionalities:\n- ADA and Cardano token swaps;\n- x * y = k liquidity pools;\n- Liquidity mining (a.k.a. yield farming).\n\nAfter 12 months:\n\n- After the Daemon Exchange launch on the mainnet we'll continue with the development of the features from the below list:\n- Bridges to other blockchains and wrapped tokens;\n- Crypto indexes;\n- Synthetic and mirrored crypto assets;\n- Crypto futures and derivatives.\n\n \n\nEach of the above is a very complex development effort in its own right, but we expect to be able to launch at least 2 of the above in the 6 months following the mainnet launch (we assume each of the above will require about 3 months of development at least before launch).\n\nImpact on the challenge metrics\n\nSource: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/25941\n\n \n\nDeFi (liquidity providing and farming) applications attract enormous amounts of users and monetary value: https://dappradar.com/defi.\n\n \n\nPancakeSwap which launched just on September 20, 2020 already amassed (source: https://dappradar.com/binance-smart-chain/defi/pancakeswap):\n- 579.23k monthly active users;\n- 2.93M monthly transactions;\n- $30.64B in traded volume; and\n- $4.08B in total value locked.\n\n \n\nWe believe that PancakeSwap's success can be replicated on Cardano blockchain due to similar advantages that Binance Smart Chain (BSC) poses compared to Ethereum, namely low transaction fees. As DeFi users often engage in approving new liquidity pools, swap pairs, and staking, and collecting rewards, we believe that a good underlying transaction cost structure is paramount to attracting large volumes of users and efficient and liquid swap platforms.\n\n \n\nAs such similar DeFi solution allowing for token swaps and liquidity providing via automated market maker (AMM) mechanism and LP token farming will be paramount to Cardano wide adoption, as similar to Binance Smart Chain it seen parabolic growth (https://dappradar.com/blog/binance-smart-chain-2021-overview) due to wildfire adoption of DeFi applications, many simply cloning PancakeSwap.\n\n \n\nSpecifically addressing the challenge metrics, we believe that\n- Number/growth of application output: The application will attract new users onto Cardano blockchain, primarily interested in investing into DeFi, and in the future using verbose trading platform, and ability to buy crypto indexes, and other instruments; if we assume the best case scenario growth, this might be even in hundreds of thousands year on year growth as in the case of PancakeSwap, or in the more moderate case in 4-5 digit range.\n- Number/growth of application transactions: As the platform is trading focused it'll translate significantly to the amount of transactions performed on Cardano blockchain. A typical PancakeSwap user stakes 5-10 contracts and either uses an auto compounding platform or compounds manually from daily to weekly. This gives an estimate of 5 (LP contracts) * 8 (actions per week) = 50 transactions per user per week = 5 transactions per day (rounding down and assuming conservative metrics). This combined with expected year on year (YoY) growth of 10-100k users translates to about 50-500k daily transactions.\n- Total volume of Ada involved in application transactions: As exchanges and DeFi apps attract everyone from a typical small volume user to whales, we expect typical distribution known to the other platforms - high volume from small groups of people and small volume from large numbers of people (fat tail distribution).\n\n \n\nLast, but not least, DeFi and financial applications are the top DApps developed on any other existing blockchain as of today. UniSwap, SushiSwap, 1inch, and many others in the case of Ethereum, and PancakeSwap and many clones in the case of BSC. We believe the similar state for Cardano blockchain once smart contracts Alonzo update is rolled out and DApps establish on the blockchain.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nCommunity engagement\n- Paper trading platform on Cardano testnet via mirrored assets and ADA from the faucet. Leaderboard of paper traders.\n- Educational articles, code, videos, and \"idea dinners\" via Twitter Spaces for everyone wanting to trade on the exchange.\n- IFO (Initial Farm Offerings) of Cardano community tokens.\n- Trade for a good cause - LP fees will be contributed to a charity of choice elected by the community (votes via LP tokens).\n\nKPI\n\n- User retention - users who are still active after 6 months; can be projected using power series (e.g. approx 6 month retention from 1 month, take 1 month retention to 6th power). Calculated based on the connected wallet address.\n- User growth - year on year user growth (can be projected via regression or taking into the account marketing campaigns).\n- Monthly Active Users (MAU) and average attention span.\n- Average trade volume, average slippage, divergence from centralized exchange and price oracles.\n- Number of assets traded, total trade volume.\n\nRoadmap\n\n- Implement React.js, TypeScript, yarn compilation stack UI learning from the familiar layout and UI ideas from PancakeSwap and UniSwap.\n- Setup cardano-graphql [CODE.0] node for querying Cardano blockchain for on-chain data, integrate with the portal via GraphQL API [CODE.1, CODE.2] calls.\n- Implement x * y = k AMM (Automate Market Maker) model to start with using Plutus [LP.0].\n- Implement yield token farming mechanism and mint token.\n- Publish open beta on testnet for paper trading (trading with worthless assets). Testnet will provide ADA via faucet and we can implement mirrored (synthetic) tokens for popular crypto using token emissions policies (it's testnet, so technically everything is \"worthless\" when it comes to real money value). Testnet exchange will serve as a great code testing battleground and feedback gathering vehicle. However, it's important to note it won't test the platform in the real market conditions (e.g. arbitrage trading).\n- Research path independent AMM models. The most known models are x * y = k (UniSwap and PancakeSwap), similar asset pools (Curve), and dynamic liquidity pools of up to 8 assets (Balaner) [LP.0]. However, we believe there's a lot of value in fundamental study of market mechanics behind each AMM model and that there's a lot of potential for innovation, from different value on the LHS of x * y = k giving different balancing mechanisms, through sharing very liquid assets (such as BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, etc.) among different pools, etc. This would be a research study with tested implementations and either learning that specific model is subpar or superior and then added to the exchange. The most fundamental questions to answer are what are the risks to reward models and if each AMM mechanism is sound and safe [LP.1, LP.2].\n- Implement crypto indexes [LP.3]. A good example of a similar idea already implemented is TokenSet: https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi (DeFI pulse link). Trader buys a stake of the index that represents the market composition by the capitalization for the specific group of assets (e.g. top 100 cryptocurrencies, top 25 DeFis, top 10 smart chain cryptos, etc.); the index is rebalanced at a constant interval (typically 3rd week of every month) and maintains specific index properties (e.g. in the case of TokenSet they limit max position to 25%). Prices and market capitalizations would be ingested from https://coinmarketcap.com/, https://www.coingecko.com/en, and other exchanges.\n- Integrate coins and tokens from other blockchains. Unique approach of Cardano cross-blockchain interoperability creates the first of a kind opportunity to create a decentralized exchange that operates similarly to a centralized one, in the sense it gives access to assets from across all the chains, with the additional benefits that it doesn't auto censor specific crypto assets out, and it has no central authority governing it (hence, for instance no KYC - Know Your Customer).\n- Implement cryptocurrency derivatives - futures and option contracts, provided via collateral and automatic liquidation, allow takers to specify the liquidation threshold via provided collateral.\n- Implement mirrored (synthetic) instruments via tokens and collateral mechanism (this is not that different in technical and quantitative sense as the derivatives trading, it just gives the impression of holding an underlying asset). Mirrored assets allow for listing instruments such as stocks (e.g. Tesla - mTSLA [LP.9], Apple - mAAPL [LP.10], etc.). The price is guaranteed via provided collateral and price is tracked via oracle. Some of the most known examples of such protocols are Mirror [LP.5, LP.6] and Syntetix.\n- Interesting observation is that there is not much difference in providing an opposite instrument to the mirrored one (i.e. the one of which the price rises equal to the price decline of the underlying and vice versa). Synthetix implements that and assets instead of \"s\" in front of the ticker, e.g. sTLSA, have \"i\" (standing for inverse) such as iTSLA. However, in practice collateral mechanism opens doors for any financial instrument representation, even volatility index, of which a good example from the classical finance world would be VIX [LP.11, LP.12].\n- Develop educational resources with Jupyter Notebook and a series of articles providing information how liquidity provides work, what are the risks, what are the rewards, and what market mechanisms are involved. Jupyter Notebooks will further give examples, with which the user can play, showing what really impermanent loss (IL) is and how it's affected by different LP models, and market mechanisms. Develop resources for all provided financial instruments via the exchange.\n- Create an incentivization model for traders to write articles and share their knowledge. The idea is to use a small portion LP reward token (1-5%) minted to distribute to educational content providers on the platform (from the community) with each LP reward token emittance, hence promoting education on par with investing.\n- Build API and column-oriented data store (ClickHouse) with read-only mode providing all exchange market data for consumption by users to allow to build complex models. Due to the size of some of this data, small requests will be free, but bulk ones will be likely charged in accordance to the throughput price of the cloud provider from where the data would be streamed.\n- Build API for strategy integration allowing to write custom code that takes pricing data from the exchange, potentially historical as well for backtesting and strategy development, and perform algo trading. We might consider the ability to host strategies on the exchange and charge % fee for the usage of it (e.g. strategy earns X in profits, 5% is paid to strategy developers and 95% to the user).\n- Develop fluentd, prometheus, and Grafana platform monitoring, and make some of the metrics available to the website users.\n- Add NFTs similar to PancakeSwap to allow people to customize their exchange accounts and to be able in the future to create trading competitions.\n- Implement a lottery system for burning LP reward tokens.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nFundamentals\n\n[FUN.0] Composing Contracts: An Adventure in Financial Engineering.

We've been busy building React.js based game engine to show Viffs and their interactions. There are simple 2 rooms there for now: the Viff meeting room and your Viff observer host room. Viffs have a random goal now (they can get cup of coffee and turn PC on/off, but that's all for now). This is just to give you the idea of how the actual Viff simulation might look like. We've had to use viffclub.com domain for now as our reversed proxy renewed Lets Encrypt certificate over 10 times: https://crt.sh/?q=viff.club . Our very sad mistake, but we'll be updating in a week and keeping viffclub.com as redirect. Important note: current Viff graphics are just placeholders as we are currently work on building Viff generation scripts and genesis graphics. None, of the Viffs are minted, yet, they are randomly generated before the stage is loaded.\n- April 21: Added link to Google Docs with detailed Viff.Club development plan: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_I91McQXfBeo8BlFf13vgkxt4dWdTKCBreq2LX1PuY .

The exact numbers are hard to predict and we did our best to approximate costs based on our prior development experience. In essence, they'd be sufficient for the plan and shouldn't differ much from the present allocation.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nDetailed Description\n\nMeet Viff\n\nViff is your on-chain crypto-friend, but what exactly is Viff?\nViff is an NFT composed of the following on-chain metadata:\n- Viff's body - SVG shape object [1] randomly generated and unique throughout the entire universe (each Viff is 100% unique); using SVG [1] allows to store the entire Viff graphics on-chain;\n- Viff's gadgets - references to gadgets that your Viff received; those are added via depositing to smart contract with unique Viff's id; each gadget has rarity and limited emittance;\n- Viff's emotions - similar to gadgets types of emotions are minted, rare, and can be assigned to Viff (e.g. curious, joyful, explorative, etc.); emotions once assigned are associated with Viff forever; emotions contribute to Viff's utility function, hence influence his behavior;\n- Viff's traits - earned completely through random interactions in the simulation; e.g. inquisitive and curious Viff might be influenced to learn new things and acquire new trait, traits might be temporary or permanent; if they're temporal they're stored off-chain, if they become permanent they're minted same way as gadgets and given to Viff.\n\nWhat does Viff look like?\n\nViff is a slime-like creature with transparent jelly and adorable eyes. Viff can hold gadgets such as evil horns, cooking hats, or hockey sticks. Sometimes Viff might have a small accident, e.g. end up with guitar stuck in its jelly for a few days temporarily modifying its look. Also, look out because Viff can swallow some of your coins (don't worry they won't come out of your wallet, but Viff has a tendency for things getting stuck in its jelly).\n\n \n\nWhat does Viff do?\n\nHowever, that's not all, we discussed what Viff is, but we haven't talked about what Viff does.\n\n \n\nViff is a living organism, it's got a pretty body, maybe some gadgets, but most importantly Viff has emotions and life objectives. All Viffs are simulated in a 2.5D pixelated game. You don't take part in the game, Viffs just live their lives among themselves. It gives you an opportunity to observe what your Viff and others do.\n\n \n\nViffs are living their lives in one of the biggest off-chain live simulations in the world. Each clock cycle, each Viff will take the current state, it's surroundings, emotions, and objectives into account and select the best course of action to pursue. All interactions into which Viff enters have different possibilities of outcomes based on randomness, but also on Viff's traits. Some interactions might change Viff's state temporarily, but some for permanent (e.g. Viff might acquire a new trait).\n\n \n\nYou can track Viffs lives via a pixelated game. You can center and follow your Viff, but also any other Viff as long as you know it's name or see it and can attach a camera to it manually. All interactions are stored in Viff's life history and you can browse and search through it. Notable events such as learning new traits, making friends, etc. will be bookmarked as important life events.\n\n \n\nWe also mentioned that Viff is your crypto-friend, right? Well, it wouldn't be too nice, if you couldn't talk to your friend. We're researching a language/psychological chat interaction model that's feasible for us to implement, but which gives the impression of actual conversation. Emacs ELIZA despite it's simplicity emulated a very human type of conversation [2]. We plan on building a more complex model that can deliver detailed conversations, but we think a lot of fun things can be done. Finally, the conversational style will be unique to each Viff, as it'll be influenced by the Viff's emotional and personal traits, and state.\n\n \n\nDoes Viff die?\n\nNo, Viffs are forever.\n\n \n\nWhere does Viff live?\n\nWe propose development of Viff Club, a virtual-space that shows all Viff's in real-time in a form of browser based 2.5D game. The only difference is, you don't control anything, you can just watch, each Viff is an autonomous agent with its own goals and reward function (influenced by its emotion, gadgets, state, etc.).\n\n \n\nWe've parked the https://viff.club (not set up yet) and https://viffclub.com (hosting the game engine demo) domains and are in the process of developing browser UI.\n\n \n\nThe Viffs' world will be simulated in an off-chain game engine which also creates snapshots that nothing is lost even in the case of total failure. We might even use FileCoin or ARWeave to store snapshots.\n\n \n\nReact.js view engine will be used to watch the Viffs' world in real-time and give access to all other functionalities such as minting Viffs, giving Viff new gadgets and traits, reading Viff life history, and more.\n\n \n\nFinally, all Viff information will be stored on-chain as NFTs. As Viffs evolve, e.g. are given gadgets each gadget or trait will hold a unique Viff id to keep association with it.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nTimeline\n\nLaunchpad\n\nWe plan 3 phase launch (all dates are 2021):\n- July: Viff minting and customization system with NFT minting, gadget, and emotions equipping, and simulation with a static map (the world will be eventually fully dynamic and procedurally generated). Viff.Club will be tested on the testnet and launched on the mainet following shortly smart contract deployment on the mainnet.\n- September: implementation of smart agents taking the Viff state, emotions, traits, and gadgets as input and generating at each simulation loop objectives for Viff to fulfill.\n- November: Implementation of a procedurally generated world that is expanded upon Viff interactions with the surrounding - environment. Launch of season customization for the winter season, and completed platform launch in December.\n\nDefinition of Success\n\nAfter 3 months:\n\n- Completed React.js simulation browser viewer, implemented using React.js and Three.js. For an idea of what it might look like visit https://viff.club.\n\n- Completed Viff minting stage (front-end page).\n- Completed minting smart contracts for Viffs, gadgets, and emotions on testnet.\n- Completed development of the basic interaction simulation engine allowing for simple Viff interactions with the environment and themselves and simple utility algorithms.\n- Stack integrating the backend, front-end, and the simulation (game) loop.\n\nAfter 6 months:\n\n- Implementation of complex reward functions derived from Viff state, emotions, gadgets, and traits.\n- Implementation of Markov-chain model for path dependent decisions.\n- Implementation of emotion and gadget assignment mechanics (attaching additional properties to Viff's).\n- Viff timeline showing interactions and Viff profile.\n\nAfter 12 months:\n\n- Procedurally generated work, where the work is generated based on Viff interactions with it, which might change the current state of the objects in the world, and which might expand the world itself (exploration).\n- Event based customization with the winter season being launched first.\n\nImpact on the challenge metrics\n\nSource: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/25941\nNFTs are a very active area of blockchain development and usage at the moment. We believe that innovative approach to NFTs (not just a static piece of file such as image or music or a certificate), but rather ownership certificate of a sentient being (Viff) that is the 3rd generation of all tamagotchis put in one world, would definitely attract interest to Cardano blockchain.\nBased on the current metrics, we'd expect active platform engagement and trading, and would estimate the level at 500-1000 users at the end of the year.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\n- We want to offer airdrop to a limited number of Catalyst users. Purely to reward Catalyst users for building the future of Cardano and will not be tied to voting or engagement on this specific project, etc.\n- We'll host an initial fixed-price sale of first Viffs with a higher ratio of rare items to reward the Viff pioneers via a dutch auction (as the number of Viffs will be limited).\n- Small stake (around 5%) of Viffs might be reserved as presents, e.g. to YouTubers to make reviews or notable community members (both to engage them to explore and give feedback on the idea, but also as a token of appreciation of their work).\n- After that you'll only get Viff based on the time-clocked minting policy, in a form of dutch auction.\n\nKPI\n\n- User retention - users who are still active after 6 months; can be projected using power series (e.g. approx 6 month retention from 1 month, take 1 month retention to 6th power).\n- User growth - year on year user growth (can be projected via regression or taking into the account marketing campaigns).\n- Monthly Active Users (MAU) and average attention span.\n- Average orphanage time; if not all Viffs are pre bough, what is average time Viff doesn't have an owner. This would be used to slow down the emission rate. If there isn't orphan time the new Viff minting rate will return to the default policy setting the maximum emission rate.\n- Viff value appreciation. For those transactions that we can observe from the blockchain what's the price appreciation of Viffs from the time brought to the sale time. If the price appreciates it means that Viffs are unique and hence perceived as valuable based on the time in the simulation and their uniqueness or specific traits.\n\nRoadmap\n\n- Develop SVG Viff-base models with random parameterization via SVG parameters (such as color, gradient type, and random mutations to the shape outline). Further thanks to SVG format we'll be able to store the entire NFT on-chain!\n- Develop and test SVG based Viff generation.\n- Create a set of SVG gadgets that Viff might receive. Include rarity information in the process of creation of the gadgets themselves (gadgets can be assigned to Viff, but can also be traded separately and stacked/unstacked from Viff via smart contracts in the future).\n- Research and design personality traits. Each trait must translate to the utility function and each personality trait should have activation thresholds for each decision to be situational. Simulate Viff behavior based on different personality traits and assess the randomness of choice. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be used to focus on the personality traits maximizing the uniqueness of Viffs behaviors. Implement the initial set of personality traits and utility and activation models (this is pretty much classical neural simulation).\n- Design and create Viff land - this is the place where Viffs will live, interact with each other, and minted into.\n- Design Viff minting mechanism and time clock.\n- Design Viff land auction mechanism.\n- Design Viff gadgets, emotions, and assets marketplace allowing users to trade between themselves or burn token of Viffs, gadgets, etc. for ADA (each asset will have intrinsic value based on the initial pay price which can always be unminted), but as the Viffs live their lives and create unique history logs, become more unique, and rare, they'd hold a lot of value in themselves.\n- Research, design, and implementation Viff narrator mode (constructing stories out of the Viff behavior simulation).\n- Continue developing Viffs, gadgets, emotions, etc.\n- Allow for world exploration through the Viff eyes (allow the user to take control over Viff).\n- Generate live Viff TV, where anyone can watch the Viffs in real-time through the simulation state representation on the web page canvas.\n- Implement the ability for Viffs to acquire temporal states, e.g. Viff is curious and discovers a new piece of information, a jelly might contain a book for the next 7 days, and few have temporal property (e.g. knowledgeable).\n- Implement trait acquisition and Viff development mechanics. Viff's actions are dictated by its emotions and state, this will lead to it performing specific tasks frequently, each repetitive task will increase via a Markov chain model a probability of acquiring either new trait or skill. For instance, Viff with traits: curious, ranger, nature loving and gadget binoculars and backpack will aim to discover new forest tiles. As it does so, the probability of it finding forest gadget (e.g. antlers, moss, berries) which it can later equip raise similarly as the probability of acquiring new traits such as hunter, watcher, one with nature, etc. All second level and higher traits can only be acquired by interaction, i.e. cannot be bought and assigned to Viff making long living Viff only so much more valuable and unique.\n\n \n\n---\n\n \n\nReferences\n[1] Scalable Vector Graphics Wikipedia Article.

The details for accessing this part of the website will be hidden within the metadata of the coin and we will use a custom encryption tool to turn this data into a web address, maintaining exclusivity for the owner of the asset.\n\nIn the exclusive My BitBunny part of our website, the BitBunny adopter will be able to access exclusive pictures, a video feed and various ways to interact with the real, living bunny such as buttons for small snack choices and treats, a daily meal menu, games, and a way to donate to their adopted little friend. Other functions such as the ability to breed your BitBunny with a friend's are being considered.\n\nWe will start with one BitBunny as a proof-of-concept and start to scale up as we develop both interest, and our platform. BitBunny tokens will be sold as part of little drops and auctions from BitBunny and can be traded and re-sold off of the platform. Profitability will come with the up scaling of the platform, as we continue to sell tokens (affordably) and have various events and opportunities for donations from BitBunny owners.\n\nThe BitBunnies will travel, perform PR and help spread the adoption of tokenized physical (living) assets. If a BitBunny passes (as living assets do), we will offer a re-adoption program for free for current BitBunny owners.\n\nOur goal is to have a full rollout of the platform once Cardano's Alonzo hardfork is complete, unlocking the full functionality of smart contracts.\n\n \n\nROADMAP:\n3 MONTHS- Continued technical outlining, brainstorming, time for continued public outreach and community interaction. Building the brand, and the start of the website. Plutus Pioneer classes, additional research and conceptualization. Technical planning, search for developer and consultant.\n\n6 MONTHS- Upgrades to infrastructure completed, construction and setup of rabbit hutches with webcams, website is running in limited capacity and looking to offer the first BitBunny up for adoption by Sept. 1, 2021.\n\n1 YEAR- A large inventory of BitBunnies at all times (40+), a community of BitBunny owners and traders, various deals and partnerships with new Dapps and applications, advanced community involvement, and enough experience and evidence to take the BitBunny proof-of-concept and apply it commercially or in a logistical manner to help people conduct business and exchange tangible assets in a new way as part of a decentralized, tokenized economy.\n\nCurrently, we are very much in the early development and marketing phase. Our domain is purchased and we are creating graphics and content for the BitBunny subreddit and Instagram accounts. We have decided to submit a proposal for Project Catalyst Fund 5 in order to increase our budget to hire a developer, a web consultant, to purchase storage space, improve our rural internet connection, build additional rabbit hutches with webcams, and to provide various toys, rabbit runs and unique healthy snacks to the bunnies.\n\n \n\nBUDGET REQUESTED:\nDeveloper: $500-$1,000\nWeb consulting: $500\nInfrastructure upgrades $1,000\nConstruction upgrades $1,000\nAccessories & food: $1,000\n\nThe website will be built affordably upon Wordpress, using the Enfold theme and many layers of custom graphics. The website will use simple, clean 8-bit design with a pastel color scheme, much like our logo and banner design. A splash page will be added in the very near future to tie in the BitBunny brand and provide access to our roadmap and frequent updates.\n\nThe website will be supplemented with two currently active social media accounts on Reddit (r/BitBunny) and Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/bitbunnyio/). These will provide lots of fun community interaction and exclusive behind-the-scenes content of our little Bitbunnies out in the world and the BitBunny Ranch.\n\nALL DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS CAN BE FOLLOWED AT: https://www.reddit.com/r/bitbunny & https://www.instagram.com/bitbunnyio\n\nThank you for your consideration!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352725-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352723-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\ncoming\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352702-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352701-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nMission Statement :\nAt Asdra, our mission is \"Banking the Unbanked.\" We utilize blockchain technology and the Internet to help the less fortunate send their hard-earned money home.\nProblem Statement:\nThe World Bank and United Nations Migration Report estimate that 272 million migrants sent $689 billion through conventional banks and $1.76 trillion through underground remittances in 2020.\nUnderdeveloped countries often lack access to formal banks, making it difficult for money to flow between countries. Underground remittances offer a convenient alternative, but often involve high fees and are subject to unfair exchange rates.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appear to be the solution to the remittance problem. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fail because of their non-scalable technology, expensive proof-of-work blockchain fees, currency volatility, and difficulty of use.\nWhat is Asdra?\nThe Asdra ecosystem consists of several smart contracts that allow users to use the stable tokens and make global transfers in real time. With the Asdra app, users can make a cross-border transaction almost instantly.\nCreating the Asdra ecosystem requires rethinking everything from the ground up.\nContext\nDespite the rise of new wallets or payment services, migrants still face unequal access to banks, high transaction fees, and unfair rates. Digital currencies are not widely used or adopted in everyday payment scenarios for a variety of reasons, summarized below.\nThe blockchain problem today:\nNumerous factors kept migrants from embracing the advent of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, such as:\nVolatility\nCryptocurrencies are attractive payment options for businesses, but their volatility poses a challenge. Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are currently used as a means of payment, but their values can fluctuate drastically within minutes.\nStable Tokens\nFiat-linked cryptocurrencies like USDT are questioned for their trustworthiness and limited accessibility to exchange platforms, and often come with high transaction fees.\nTransaction speed\nEthereum and Bitcoin both struggle with slow transaction times and high network bottlenecks. Bitcoin can currently execute transactions at a rate of 4.6 per second, while Ethereum can only support transactions at a rate of 30 per second.\nFees\nConfirmations of transactions, or what we call proof of work, are only accelerated by high fees. For a single transaction, gas fees could cost as much as $8-50 by 2021. It is estimated that upfront costs will rise to $100-200 by 2022.\nComplexity\nUser Onboarding\nMany onboarding steps must be followed for a typical person to use a cryptocurrency, including managing a private key, a public key, and an incomprehensible wallet address.\nExchange and payment\nTransferring cryptocurrencies is not as easy as exchanging them, as it involves opening an account with various exchanges, verifying your identity, so someone without some crypto knowledge will find it difficult to do so. Not to mention, it is extremely difficult for people who live in economically underdeveloped countries to exchange and use cryptocurrencies.\nAsdra Objectives :\nBy creating technological solutions, we aim to make banking accessible and equal for all.\nWe are building a protocol to facilitate the use of multiple stable currency payment systems while providing a seamless and automated experience for users on multiple platforms.\nObjective 1: One-tap user onboarding\nAs a famous quote goes, \"Design is not just how it looks like or feels like. Design is how it works.\"\nAsdra places the user at the center of our forward-thinking approach. To simplify onboarding, we integrate Apple and Google login features. Both Apple and Google provide us with a unique user identifier based on the user's device and their iCloud and Google account. The identifier is unique to the Asdra application certificates.\nThis allows us to associate the blockchain wallet address with a temporary username. The user will be able to search for their family through contacts or username. After completing the security and KYC process, the user will be able to update their username and write down the wallet passphrase for security purposes.\nObjective 2: Best exchange rate and almost zero transaction fees\nIncorporated into the Asdra Token layer and the Asdra Remittance layer, smart contracts are designed to provide users with the benefits of the stable fiat token that ensures its stability and enables the lowest-cost global transfers.\nUsing multiple sources of exchange rate data from a decentralized oracle network, complex smart contracts can use reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs.\nThe remittance layer of the Asdra platform incorporates the concept of a gas station network to allow Asdra to securely manage and pay users' transaction fees, so users do not need to open an account or purchase ADA to pay their gas fees.\nObjective 3: Instant transaction\nAsdra was designed with scalability in mind. Asdra Ecosystem is part of Cardano Blockchain. Smart contracts are settled at the computation level, leaving the settlement level free to process transactions, making Asdra run faster and more efficiently.\nObjective 4: Receive cash fast\nGetting cash out is critical for the family member. Asdra and its potential partners have developed applications that enable daily transactions, currency exchanges or payments, international settlements and support for multiple branches.\nBusinesses such as convenience stores and currency exchanges with appropriate licenses that allow currency exchanges and money transfers are eligible to participate. This approach makes it easier and simpler and allows family members to collect their payment as soon as it is processed.\nObjective 5: Positive economic impact\nThe Asdra Remittance Layer will solve the problem of the vast global unregulated remittance system, often referred to as hawala (informal value transfer system).\nThe current underground system has a flaw because when money is transferred through remittances, it appears that cash has been transferred on the other side, but no money has been physically transferred from the country of origin to the country of destination. In addition, this also poses a major challenge to existing legal and regulatory regimes on money laundering and terrorist financing.\nAsdra enables fast transactions that are both protected and traceable, as well as compliant with local AML laws and regulations.\nAsdra is beneficial to Cardano\nWe have examined the regulatory system throughout Asia and Africa and found few countries that would be beneficial to Asdra and its users. These countries are mainly in South East Asia such as Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nA closer look at Thailand and Singapore. Both offer international money transfer services for non-banks and licenses for money exchange trading licenses and electronic payments.\nThailand has more than 2.3 million registered migrants in a variety of industries ranging from housekeeping to hotels to factories, while Singapore has about 350,000 registered migrants.\nRisk Factors\nWe are seeking a temporary license that will allow us to conduct alpha and beta testing in Thailand, one of the first countries where we plan to launch the service. After all the testing and security checks are completed, the jurisdiction will verify our results and determine if the system is safe, and then we will be granted the licenses.\nMain risk: The authority could delay the project while it is being processed.\nRoadmap\nAsdra means 'Star' in Greek. Our roadmaps and milestones are representations of the 'birth and rise of a new star'\nPhase 01 - White Dwarf\nQ1 2021  Company incorporation and licenses requirements - completed\nApplication UI/UX design for iOS\nToken Economy\niOS front-end and back-end test with wallet functionality \n \n\nPhase 02 - Novae\nQ2 2021\nApp development for iOS/Android - Internal alpha testing Cardano proposal\nPhase 03 - Supernovae\nQ2 2021 Smart Contract on Plutus Platform exploration\nStable Tokens Layer\nRemittance Layer, Vault Layer with Chainlink API\nPrivate Seed Round \n \n\nPhase 04 - Neutron Stars\nQ3 2021 Private Series A Round\nSmart Contract development \n \n\nPhase 05 - New Stars Arise\nQ3 July 2021 Magic Layer, Governance Layer, Public ICO \n \n\nPhase 06 - New Stars Q4 September 2021 Launch Asdra Protocol & Apps on Testnet\nCardano F5 Funding\nThe budget required is US$70,000 to cover the development costs for recruiting developers for smart contracts as well as the marketing budget to build Asdra community.\nThe amount allocated towards the development of the entire Asdra Ecosystem is estimated at approximately US$350,000..\nTeam experience:\nOur team consists of Blockchain and Smart Contract development enthusiast.\nBSc in Computer Record Management\nMBA in Economic and Business Accountant\nMIT Blockchain and Money\nHarvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science\nApple iOS front-end development\nEngaged in the Thailand and Myanmar governments' MOU to regulate the employment between the two countries through technology\nFrancesco Cardullo\nCo-Founder & Business Lead\n He is an expert in business management and programming, with experience in finance, blockchain, and token economics.\nPrior to that, he co-founded Dalton Technologies, a fintech development agency, AI dreamer, passionate by technology, entrepreneurship, and marketing, with 15 years of entrepreneurial experience. \n \n\nICDL in Information and Communication Technology\nMD in Accounting and Development FMT in Professional Trading \n \n\nPitt Sinchawla\nCo-Founder Technology Lead\nHe has extensive software engineering experience across a variety of industries, and is a leader in token economy, blockchains, distributed systems and cryptography.\nHe is also a co-founder and the CEO of multiple technology companies.

When you are finished we'd love to get some feedback from you around NFT Art and it's platforms. It should take you less than two minutes to complete: https://forms.gle/4VzmfEaPkvEBtAcF9\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\nOur mission is to present artists and their artwork in a way that honors their work rather than simply providing an NFT marketplace. We want to tell their stories, share their work, all in partnership with trusted museums, galleries, and art fairs.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nTraditional art buyers and organizations such as museums, galleries, and art fairs don't have enough guidance to utilize NFT marketplaces leaving valuable art and buyers out. Current NFT marketplaces are saturated with art that hasn't been curated by professional curators leaving the traditional art buyers confused and without guidance. These artworks are sometimes even fraudulent; in the digital world it's relatively easy to take someone else's artwork and call it your own. Furthermore, established and cutting edge museums, galleries, and art fairs are curating priceless art that hasn't been unlocked with the technology that NFTs offer.\n\nOUR SOLUTION\n\nProvide a marketing platform, and a marketplace on Cardano that services curated art (digital and physical) endorsed by museums, galleries, and art fairs around the world - NFTs as a medium to honor artists.\n\nOur Platform\n\nWe are creating an exclusive and exceptional NFT platform by building relationships with established and relevant art organizations that curate the artwork showcased on our platform.\nOur audience will be able to purchase NFTs in a variety of ways including but not limited to live auctions, silent auctions, and direct purchases.\n\n \n\nOur platform will help revolutionize the ways that museums receive funding - whenever a NFT presented by a museum is sold or resold, the museum will receive a donation. Museum donors typically receive recognition, membership, and/or access to events depending on their level of donation. NFTs provide museums with the opportunity to give their donors an additional benefit - monetizable art. Furthermore, our platform will allow museums to reach a new audience and donor base - NFT buyers.\n\nArtwork Certification\n\nWe will provide an authentication service that will allow for users to verify provenance so that only real NFTs can claim legitimacy. This helps provide proof, safety and security to all future buyers.\n\nOpportunities for Developing Artists\n\nWe will not leave developing artists out. Our platform will also regularly spotlight an artist that is presented by a fellowship program or university. This will give developing artists exposure on a platform with professional artists and provide them with access to an audience they normally wouldn't be able to reach.\n\nBringing Awareness and Education to Users\n\nVia our website, social media platform and partner art organizations we will inform traditional art buyers around the world about all of the possibilities of NFTs. We will ensure that they are educated on what NFTs are, the buying and resale process, and the value that NFTs bring to the art world. Furthermore, we are working with traditional art organizations to help them understand how NFTs are transforming the art world so that they are not left behind.\n\nInternational Impact\n\nArt organizations around the world have been greatly impacted by COVID19. They traditionally display and sell art in physical locations, where their visitors and clients come for physical experiences. This has greatly reduced their revenue. Furthermore, artists and art institutions in the continent of Africa had lower exposure to the art buying market prior to COVID 19 due to location, lack of marketing, and lack of access. COVID 19 has exasperated this situation. Our platform provides them with an additional channel to generate income. Furthermore, we will reach out to art organizations in countries underrepresented to further democratize the NFT market.\n\nEngaging The Cardano Community\n\nWe want you \"the Cardano Community\" to be involved.\n\nThe Cardano Community will receive Token Privileges, which provide them with perks such as discounts on purchasing arts and access to pre-sales.\nThe Cardano Community will be able to utilize tokens to vote on our art developing initiatives.\n\nProgress\n\nOur initial designs have been created\nWe have met with art organizations and are finalizing MOUs for them to join our platform\nWe are circulating surveys for users, art organizations, and artists to help guide our platform and the user experience\nWe have built a team of professionals that are committed to bring our platform to life\n\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\n\nOur team is international and diverse in every way imaginable. We are truly ready to launch in the international market and relate to users and artists around the world.\n\n \n\nOur Product, Technology and Design teams have a combined 40+ years technology and management consulting experience in building strategies, products for relevant markets, industries and technology. All the team members have delivered projects in the DeFi space (lending, governance, staking etc.) in their previous roles, and are looking forward to bringing this experience to accelerate the adoption of NFTs with Cardano being the technology catalyst in making this a possibility.\n\nLeadership Team\nAli Harawala, our Product and Technology lead comes with over 15 years of experience in management and technology consulting building products and teams across multiple industries and continents. Ex-founder of a DeFi aggregator platform, Ali is excited to build a NFT proposition for the art world on Cardano. Ali grew up in India and moved over to the UK to pursue a consulting career where he has been lucky to travel the world on projects and work on interesting problems.\n\n \n\nErica Knowles, our Business Development Executive was born and raised in the international city of Miami, FL, USA with African American and Bahamian roots. She has lived in Thailand and Peru and currently lives between Germany and South Africa. You can definitely say Erica loves to travel. With deep connect and working exposure with the museums, art galleries, and art fairs; experience in launching art related events; combined with new market business development with primary clients at the executive and C-suite level Erica brings the defensibility to creating a niche market to elevate artists, museums and the art work through NFTs on the blockchain.\n\nMARKET OPPORTUNITY\nMarket Validation\nTimeframe: From March 31 - April 6, 2021\n\nNiftyGateway dropped 144 new NFTs\nOn average each NFT had 79 editions totaling 11,360\nIn just 1 week $9.5 million was grossed from 144 pieces of digital art\n$1.9 Million = 20% of 1 weeks sales\n\n(Source: Niftygateway.com)\n\nMarket Size\n\nThe NFT market for art has grown in transactions from USD $619k in 2018 to USD $13M 2020, which is a 2000% increase.\n\nTimeframe: 2020\n\nTotal Art Market\nOnline sales in online art and antiques market worldwide: 12.4bn USD\n\nAvailable NFT Market\n\nMarket Cap of transactions globally involving a Non-Fungible Token (NFT): 338m USD\n\nNFT Art Market\n\nTotal sales involving a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) in the art segment: 12.9m USD (64,485 transactions)\n\nTimeframe: Apr 2021\n\nNFT market cap: $28.5bn\n\n24h Trading volume: $4.2bn\nGiven that art is transformed into non-fungible digital art with provenance, the \"Total Art Market\" is going to expand beyond the USD $12.4bn from the year 2020. Providing a cap or a number to this market is not realistic as the market is growing exponentially and we may be witnessing a multi-fold increase in the volume and the value of the art pieces transacted.\n\nTarget Market\n\nIn addition to standard NFT buyers, our target market consists of\n\nUntapped potential users of the Cardano platform\nArt Buyers\nArt Collectors\nMuseums\nGalleries\nArt fairs\n\nMARKET COMPETITORS\n\nWe are competing in a crowded market place that is saturated with art that hasn't been curated by professional curators. Major art institutions, especially museums have not participated in our competitors' platforms. This is the gap where we are entering into the market. And how we will welcome traditional art buyers and collectors onto the Cardano platform.\nNiftygateway.com\nOpenSea.com\nBitski.com\nSothebys.com\n\nThe above platforms cater to slightly different audiences, but are marketplaces in their own right. Whilst Niftygateway caters to curated art, it lacks any credible associations with vetted artists. OpenSea is a generic marketplace without any curation. Bitski is a Coinlist list style sale platform promoted with associations, but none in the way of curations. And Sotheby's promote artwork and artists directly.\n\n \n\nNone of the above, approach NFTs in the manner that provide physical and digital artists associated with exhibitions by art organizations such as museums on a dedicated platform.\n\nAlso, none of the above delve in to specific use cases such as NFTs for donors and patrons, which create a larger ecosystem in ensuring continued opportunities and exposures to museums and artists.\n\nBUSINESS MODEL\n\nProposition\n1. Art Organizations: Provide additional value to museums, galleries, and art fairs by giving additional benefits to museum donors, deepening their relationships with artists, and providing the organizations with residual funding.\n\nAdded donor benefits: Museum donors and art typically receive recognition, membership, and/or access to events depending on their level of donation. NFTs provide museums with the opportunity to give their donors an additional benefit - monetizable art. Furthermore, our platform will allow museums to reach a new donor base.\nArtist giveback: Our platform provides museums, art galleries, and art fairs with the opportunity to recommend proven artists to the world. When that artist sells their NFT they receive the majority of the sale price. They also earn money every time an edition of that NFT is resold.\nResidual funding: Similar to prints, NFTs can be sold in multiple or single editions; however, whenever an NFT your museum has presented is sold or resold the museum will receive a percentage of the sale.\n\n2. Art: Deliver art to the market that has been curated by professional curators by providing a space where museums, galleries, and art fair's can present art.\n\nThe museums/galleries//art fairs' collection: Digitize and present physical artwork that is currently a part of the art organizations' collection.\nThe museums/galleries//art fairs' artists: Present works of art from artists that the organization has relationships with that they are/aren't currently exhibiting.\nCurate digital art: The organizations can increases their curation of digital art that can be presented\nWork with art fellowship programs to highlight developing artist on a regular basis\n\n3. Community: Tapping into existing communities and patrons that are already engaged by museums and art galleries provides a distribution network to promote and sell art work\n\nInteraction\n\n1. The art organization process\n\nWe establish a relationship with a the art institution to be represented on our platform\nThe art organization selects an artist to present on our platform\nThey submit a digital exhibition, exhibition info, artist bio, artist video, photo of the artist, the artist's payment profile, and the art organization's licensing agreement with the artist\nWe convert the artworks to NFTs and mint them\nWe publish the artworks on our platform for sale/auction\nWe send proceeds of each edition sold to the art organization and the artistWhen the artwork is resold the art organization and the artist gets paid again\n\n2. The user experience\n\nThe user sets up an account on our platform and links their coin account or credit card\nThey see an NFT they wants to purchase\nThe account holder places a bid (deposit required) or purchase directly depending on the available option\nThey receive confirmation of purchase\nThe NFT is transferred to the account holder\n\nTechnology\n1. Create a marketing platform in the form of a website and social media accounts that allow for museums, artists and artwork to be show-cased and promoted. The platform will be a niche in servicing artists.\n\n \n\n2. Provide a marketplace that allows for:\n\nProvide drops to users for NFTs on a schedule with digital artists and physical art that is curated\nInitial and secondary buy and sell of NFTs\nAbility to support different trade mechanisms and incentives through direct purchases and auction types\nAbility to buy and sell using fiat and crypto options. Can tie exclusivity to ADA to ensure we are building a robust ecosystem on Cardano\nSupport direct integration with debit/credit card payment gateways\nIntegrate wallets to store and to transfer NFTs to user accounts to trade in 3rd party marketplace platforms or transfer to users own wallets\nOn-demand stats and activities on NFTs on the platform\n3. Backend interface that will allow for:\nStandard smart contracts to be implemented as a template feature based on personalized agreements with museums and artists\nAllow for fees and commissions to be configured customized to requirements of the artists\nAutomatic resale fees and commissions baked into smart contract\nWorkflow to manage the initial sale\n\nRevenue model\n1. Initial drop- the revenue share will be based on placement on our exhibition home website. For example when an exhibition is featured on our home page our platform's share will increase.\n\nPercentage to the platform\nPercentage to art institution\nPercentage to the artist\n\n2. Resale of NFTs\n\nPercentage to the platform\nPercentage to art institution\nPercentage to the artist\n\n3. Value capture in a token model using ADA will provide the incentivization based on game theory and economic principles\n\nUSE OF FUNDS\n\nMVP scope: Deliverables & Projected Costs for an Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solution to facilitate creating, promoting and trading NFTs for digital art\n\nFund 5 scope: Provide a marketing webpage that can interact with a direct purchase secondary marketplace that is integrated to the Cardano smart contract platform.\n\nMarketing Platform\n\nWebsite used for marketing and promotion to showcase museums, drops and artists [Fund 5]\nDirect Purchase [Fund 5]\nAuction options\nFiat gateway integration [Fund 5]\nWallet integration for buy/sell [Fund 5]\nWallet integration for storage [Fund 5]\nStats on platform\n\n \n\nBackoffice + Cardano Infrastructure\n\nIntegration of Cardano smart contract templates to deploy and mint NFT based on artist/museum requirements [Fund 5]\nAdmin-driven configuration to be able to set up types of NFTs, Revenue parameters etc.\nArtist/Museum on-boarding, art-work management\nWorkflow to ensure onboard of artists, museums\n\nFund 5 - Budget Request\n\n$3,500 - Marketing Platform\n$14,000 - Marketplace\n$10,300 - Backoffice + Cardano Infrastructure\nTotal request $27,800\n\nROADMAP\n\nHow do we plan on bringing our project to fruition\n\nMonth 2: Finalize relationships with seed museums, galleries and art fairs in our initial art source market Miami, FL, USA\nMonth 2: Finalize Exhibition home website\nMonth 3 - Finalize marketplace\nMonth 4: Soft launch\nMonth 5: Network stabilized\nMonth 6: Full launch\nMonth 12: Build relationships with our second art source market Cape Town, South Africa\nRepeat the process and continue to expand city by city.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe project is looking to create a niche for itself within the multi-billion dollar art industry that can be extended out to paintings, music, photography etc. We believe that high-end art needs exclusive platforms that cater to the industry's needs rather than generic marketplaces. Additionally, and importantly, artists in underdeveloped or developing nations will have an elevated playing ground in showcasing their talents with access to a global market.\n\n \n\nCardano will be a great technology partner that can aid the project to further our vision for what NFTs can do for artists. Especially through the vibrant community that Cardano has along with the alignment we find ourselves in elevating talent in markets such as the African nations.\n\n \n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to read our proposal.

The difference with bitcoin and other tokens, though, is that each NFT is unique and can't be replicated, which makes them sellable. NFTs offer a formalization of digital ownership, cleverly responding to the art world's need for authentication and provenance. Each one accrues value independently, deriving their value from how scarce they are.\n\n \n\nCrypto art is the strongest growing subsection of the digital collectibles market. While Digital Art has a long-established history as an artistic medium, it was the introduction of NFTs and blockchain technology that provided the possibility to assign value and provenance to digital works of art. This was previously impossible due to the ease of duplication.\n\n \n\nEach NFT-based digital creation now contains a digital signature from the artist and all vital details including time of creation, edition size and a record of any prior sales permanently attached to the artwork. Noah Davis, Specialist, Post-War and Contemporary Art, remarked that \"NFT-based art is on the threshold of becoming the next ingeniously disruptive force in the art market.\" A true exercise in abstraction, the actual NFT-based artwork is just a code, it doesn't exist. Explaining that Christie's has never offered a new media artwork of this scale or importance before, he says this sale places the auction house \"in the vanguard of this exhilarating movement.\" Beeple adds:\"The technology is now at a place with the blockchain to be able to prove ownership and have true scarcity with digital artwork so I think we are going to see an explosion of not only new artwork, but also new collectors and I am very honored to be a part of this movement.\"\n\n \n\nAs NFTs become ubiquitous, we need a system on Cardano that ensures rapid development of emerging use cases, interoperability between all parties and that supports Cardano to become the de facto choice to launch NFT businesses.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352685-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352678-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352643-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nWhat is Ensuro\nEnsuro is a decentralized underwriter to support insurance products. It will democratize the possibilities and the benefits of being an insurer for everyone while allowing innovative companies to nurture and deploy novel, life-changing insurance products.\nIn African insurance under-collateralization is a common problem that blockchain can mitigate. Ensuro is aligned with the vision of Cardano \"to be the financial stack for the developing world\".\nCurrent Status\n1. Ensuro has a functional prototype built on Solidity.\n2. Won the first prize in the Binance Hackathon: The Future is now: https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/projects/binance/ensuro/\n3. A team of 4 people with a strong background:\nChief Executive Officer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-mirabella/\nChief Technology Officer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermonarvaja/\nChief Scientific Officer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-mungo-a26278103/\nChief Risk Officer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gian-giacomo-della-torre-575b02114/\nThe team is advised by Darren Camas former advisor at Cardano: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcamas/\nEnsuro has three main goals:\n1. It allows everyone to participate in the risk market and provide capital to back up insurance products.\n2. It can provide a fast route for novel insurance products and operators to collect working capital, reducing the sector's entry barriers.\n3. It can automatize the payment of claims and remove insurance's information asymmetry and moral hazard issues.\nThe Ensuro protocol will be composed of two main components:\n1. Liquidity pool:\nEnsuro created a dynamic pool governed by a smart contract on the Cardano blockchain (Liquidity Pool) in which Liquidity Providers (LPs) can deposit money under the form of stable coins , defining their acceptable cashback period, namely the amount of time they are willing to wait for receiving their money if they ask it back.\nThe presence of well-defined cashback periods permits the protocol to plan ahead, i.e., to compute the amount of capital available at any point in the future. This clear forward vision allows Ensuro to operate at the desired solvency level (99.5%, in line with the EIOPA's Solvency II regulation).\nInsurance is a profitable business. Being at the core of the protocol, liquidity providers will share the profits coming from the pool. More specifically, each of the liquidity providers will receive a share of the profits depending on his deposit's size and the length of his cashback period. Intuitively, the protocol will favor liquidity providers that will lend more money for extended periods.\n2. Risk monitoring module:\nThe Ensuro protocol will allow the deployment of different models to cover several types of risk (Risk model). The Ensuro's risk monitoring module will allow different risk model to integrate with different blockchain oracles (i.e. API3) to increase transparency in the claiming process.\nIn order to protect the Liquidity Providers of our system the Ensuro Risk Monitoring Module will perform continuous Quality Assurance Tests (QA) on each module to continuously evaluate the performance of each risk model.\nGo To Market :\nAs first step Ensuro will target Risk model providers and MGA in order to have their system deployed on the protocol.\nGiven the structure of the pool, the goal of the protocol is to obtain an uncorrelated and diversified portfolio of risk modules. In the first 3 months the focus of the business team will be to convince at least 3 model providers that create products for different sectors (i.e. flight delay insurance, crop insurance, weather insurance, etc).\nAt the beginning the company will target parametric insurance products because they do not require human intervention in the claim process thus reducing possible fraud, in the future the protocol will also include non parametric products.\n\nEstimated Roadmap\n\n2021 Q2:\n\n• Writing whitepaper\n\n• Define token-economics\n\n• Design and launch website\n\n• Set up social media profiles and public channels for interaction with the community\n\n• First version of the smart contracts (Liquidity pool and QA)\n\n2021 Q3\n\n• Partnership with at least 3 MGAs or white label risk model providers from different sectors (i.e. flight delay insurance, crop insurance, weather insurance, etc)\n\n• Audit of the smart contract from third party auditor\n\n• Launch pilot with real users (Liquidity providers) and Risk Model provider\n\n2021 Q4\n\n• Launch full service\n\n• Definition of DAO for selection of risk models providers, and overall decision of the protocol\n\n2022\n\n• Partnership with tier 1 reinsurance company\n\nAsk\nIn order to increase visibility and trust from potential clients the company would need to create a professional website and start increasing its online presence, for this reason we are considering hiring a social media manager (part-time). The estimated cost will be 3k usd for the website + 500 USD/ month for the social media manager.\nOur team is composed of 4 people that are currently working full-time without a salary. We are expecting to use part of the funds to pay a minimum salary (2k USD each) to the members of the project to allow them to focus on Ensuro for 6 months before the protocol will be fully functional and generate revenues.\nIn total we would need US1.5k [design of professional website]+500/month*3 months [Social media Manager] + 2k/month*6 months*4 people [Salary for team] ~=US50k","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352596-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nVision\n\nOur vision is to become a top choice for tokenizing and monetizing fungible and non-fungible assets on Cardano\n\nMission\n\nOur mission is to remove the entry barriers into digital art and native tokens for both artists/producers and consumers, enabling a wider adoption through our platform built on Cardano at a globally affordable cost.\n\nAnd we strongly believe we can do this for as many users as possible, who may already be part of the Cardano Community or just thinking of how to use blockchain to improve their lives, better themselves or just support their communities.\n\nIn terms of utility our platform will allow you to tokenize assets and digitize artwork, as well as giving our users the means to monetize those assets, all under an easy to use, powerful and globally afordable platform.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming NFTDOT.IO ( https://nftdot.io ) - your central dot in the new tokenized world\n\nTeam founders:\n\nFred Tarasevicius - Role: Product vision / Location: US / Expertise: Blockchain Researcher, DevOps, Visionary, Software development\nProfile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-tarasevicius-67890127/\nPaval Cosmin - Role: Operations and finance / Location: EU / Expertise: Management, ITIL Best Practices, Prince2 Project Management, ISO 27001 Lead Implementer, Cloud Service Delivery and Operations\nProfile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cosminpaval/\nPatrick Sturm - Role: Tech Lead / Location: AU / Expertise: Software development\n\n \n\nWe have already started as SPO by establishing TAILS staking pool and we have a working version of our minting web module that is being used to help lots of our community members to join the digital space and adopt Cardano technology as part of the solution.

The app shows upcoming events, a feed of her social media and news about her favorite teams. She sees Lakers fans trash talking the Warriors on Twitter. Since Alice is a Warriors fan, she posts \"Put your money where your mouth is!\" She searches events for the next Warriors vs Lakers game, selects the event and fills in a bet offer with the amount of money she is willing to bet and the odds she is offering.\nFor example, Alice could offer to bet up to $100 USD value of ALLIN tokens at even odds. She chooses to post this offer to Twitter and confirms the offer by entering her wallet spending password.\nThe ALLIN platform creates a Plutus smart contract on the Cardano network representing this bet offer and posts the offer to the selected social media platforms, Twitter in this case.\nBob, who is a Lakers fan, sees the offer on Twitter and clicks on it. This opens up a bet slip in the ALLIN app where Bob can choose how much he wants to bet. Bob chooses to bet $20 value of ALLIN tokens and confirms his bet by entering his wallet spending password.\nAlice is notified that her offer has been partially filled by Bob. At this point Carlos could also accept Alice's offer for up to $80 value of ALLIN tokens at any time up until the expiration time of the offer, which would usually be the start of the game. At offer expiration, the remaining $80 value of ALLIN tokens is returned to Alice.\nWhen the event is over, the smart contract receives the result from the defined oracle. Initially this will be provided by InsideLine (ALLIN dApp creator) but in future versions the result will come from blockchain based oracles.\nIn our example, let's say that the Lakers won the game and the validated result is received by the smart contract. The smart contract will then pay Bob $40 value of ALLIN tokens. His $20 plus $20 from Alice since it was an even odds bet.\nAlice and Bob will then have their respective reputation scores updated with the results of the bet.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW\n\nWe are using agile development practices and development is underway.\nOur goals for this funding round are:\n1 Completion of the backend models and APIs for the basic bet placing functionality.\n2 Development of the frontend web application showing all basic functionality of bet offering and accepting.\n3 Integration with at least one social media platform.\n4 Integration with at least one sports statistics and sports news provider.\n5 Initial UI / UX designs for MVP functionality.\n6 Prototype for Plutus bet smart contract.\nWe will deliver web and mobile applications for Windows / Linux / Mac / Android / iOS with the same functionality, using React and React Native.

Welcome to Burblr - the world's first NFT Dapp on the Cardano ecosystem that allows users to collect and trade exclusively minted Works (eBooks and audio books) from their favorite authors.\n\n \n\nWhy now?\n\nOver the next 5-10 years, we believe digitalization of assets has a strong outlook and will continue to trend upward, specifically for literary assets in the form of eBooks and audio books. This presents a timely opportunity for Burblr to offer a way for people to collect, showcase, and trade literary assets. As certain aspects of society become more and more centralized, Burblr can leverage the Cardano ecosystem to offer access to authentic literary assets in a decentralized way.\n\n \n\nHow does it work?\n\nGetting started - Users can access Burblr from the good old fashioned internet where they can create a free account at burblr.io.\n\n \n\n• Boxes - next, users can choose their favorite genre of eBooks/audio books such as mystery, autobiography, or others, then wait for the next Box Drop to buy their first Box. Box Drops happen periodically and any user can join the fun with just a credit card. Each Box consists of various Works, or eBooks and audiobooks with serialized minted NFTs.\n\nBoxes come in 3 flavors:\n\no Basic (starting at $6) - contains numerous Basic Works (eBooks/audio books) across various genres unless stated otherwise.\n\no Rare (starting at $49) - contains multiple Rare Works (eBooks/audio books) across various genres unless stated otherwise.\n\no Immortal (starting at $149) - contains some Immortal Works (eBooks/audio books) across various genres unless stated otherwise.\n\n \n\n \n\n• Marketplace - Users can buy and sell Works they acquire on the Marketplace. Works can be purchased in fiat or crypto such as ADA (we are planning to add support for other cryptos as the need arises). Sellers are charged a 5% transaction fee for each sale. Works will fluctuate in value based on many factors, including but not limited to serial number and type of Work. Works on can be shared on social media so anyone could view them on the Marketplace (though they'd need an account to buy).\n\n \n\n• Library - Users can store Works in the Library and read/listen to them at any time. They can also showcase their favorite Works to the Community by making them public.\n\n \n\n• Community - Users can view other users profiles, including any published social media links, favorite genre, and showcased Works.\n\n \n\n• Challenges - Users can participate in periodic Challenges where they need to collect specific Works in order to claim the Challenge Box which would contain special edition Works. For example, they might need to collect 8 different autobiographies in order to unlock the Challenge Box which contains a Rare autobiography.\n\n \n\n• Status - The Status of a user represents how much they've accomplished, the higher the Status the more they can unlock.\n\nStatus levels:\n\no Noob\no Amateur\no Pro\no Elite\no Legend\no Icon\n\nWhere would these Works come from?\n\n• Burblr would mint NFTs for these Works in conjunction with established publishers as well as independent authors (self-publishing). In order to bring larger publishers on board, we take a partnership approach by offering a percentage of seller transaction sales in the Marketplace for affiliated Works. We would also make it frictionless for independent authors, allowing them to simply provide their eBook/audiobooks which would be minted into serialized NFTs for a fee.\n\n \n\nHow are Works in Boxes selected?\n\n• We deploy a proprietary algorithm that curates Works into various Boxes based on a range of criteria, including but not limited to genre, rating, author, and historical sales.\n\n \n\nWhy Burblr?\n\n• Mass adoption\n\nThere are millions upon millions of people who read on tablets, smartphones, and laptops. If you were to walk into a bar with 10 people and ask them about NFTs, how many would know what you're talking about? The guy who had too much to drink doesn't count because he agrees with everything, but it's likely that perhaps one or two, ok maybe three, would nod and say something like yea NFTs are great! Realistically, they likely wouldn't know what NFTs truly are and what value they provide. But, what if someone could engage with NFTs from their tablet, laptop, or smartphone without even knowing it because it's just that easy? Burblr takes a deeply intuitive approach by allowing users to buy Boxes in fiat or crypto, eliminating a massive barrier to entry for humans who are not crypto-centric. This means that users can seamlessly use Burblr without any roadblocks other than a credit card - in and of itself we believe this to be a significant element in attracting mainstream usage of Burblr and thus the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n \n\n• Utility and Value\n\nNFTs of neon cheeseburgers and sparkly cats are great, but Burblr also offers a layer of meaningful utility where you can actually access and read or listen to your Works, just like you would outside of crypto. This makes it something that can be used in conjunction with one of the world's oldest past times, reading. By utilizing Burblr, publishers and independent authors can create a new revenue stream by leveraging NFTs to track the sale of their works, allowing them to capitalize on opportunities otherwise unavailable on the secondary market. In other words, if you were to read something and give it to a friend nobody else would really know. The author also doesn't get paid, hence the astronomical price of text-books, as publishers know the likelihood of losing money on the secondary market is magnitudes higher than not. Now with Burblr, each Work would correspond to an NFT with a smart contract that is structured to pay out commission on each sale.\n\n \n\n• Fun\n\nBooks are inherently boring, ok maybe the things you read are interesting but a book by itself is merely, well, boring (seriously). The novelty of being in a bookstore has faded and is logistically difficult in a post-Covid world. Burblr delivers the experience in a whole new way where there is excitement at every level, allowing readers to not only derive value from the things they read, but also from the initial purchase down through showcasing a collection (humans love to collect things). The prospect of opening a Box that may have exceptionally valuable and interesting Works is something that is incredibly fun.\n\n \n\nHow much money are we asking for?\n\n• We're asking for thirty-thousand dollars ($30,000). Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) would be allocated to tech and development while five thousand ($5,000) would go towards tax and legal fees. Marketing, Sales, Partnership Acquisition, and other necessary functions will be performed gratis.\n\n \n\nWhat is our definition of success after 3, 6, and 12 months?\n\n• 3 months - On the technical end, development is at full-speed and the Dapp is in the process of being built. On the business development side, partnerships with major publishers and self-publishing authors are being explored. Marketing efforts are being accelerated to increase exposure and drive pre-signups on Burblr.io.\n\n• 6 months - On the technical end, development is nearing completion and testing/QA is being performed. Finishing touches are being added to have a fully functioning robust web Dapp. On the business development side, partnerships with major publishers and self-publishing authors are coalescing into the final stages of agreeing upon terms, content selection, distribution, and minting of NFTs. Marketing is preparing a push to engage our customer segments for our official web Dapp launch.\n\n• 12 months - On the technical end, iOS and Droid apps for smartphones and tablets are being developed. Additional development is also being done on the web Dapp to fix any bugs and optimize performance. On the business and marketing side, existing partnerships with major publishers continue to expand and flourish with the addition of new content. Additional partnerships with major publishers are being pursued. Formal joint marketing and PR efforts are being pursued with existing publishers and independent authors.\n\n \n\nHow would Burblr generate revenue?\n\n• 5% Marketplace Seller transaction fee\n\n• Box Sales\n\n• Fees from Publishers to mint NFTs of eBooks/audio books\n\n• Fees from Independent Authors to mint NFTs of eBooks/audio books\n\n \n\nWhat would the future beyond the initial web Dapp look like?\n\n• Burblr mobile Dapps for smartphones and tablets\n\n• Expand and develop partnerships with key publishers\n\n• Add additional employees to scale growth\n\nWhy Cardano and Project Catalyst?\n\n• Secure, cost-effective blockchain designed to scale for future growth\n\n• Non-rivalrous process\n\n• Engaged and energized community\n\n• Exceptional leadership and execution\n\n \n\nHow does Burbr impact key metrics of this challenge?\n\nWhen asking, is Burblr an NFT Dapp that will attract users near and far from the world Cardano? The answer is a resounding Yes. Why? It's quite simple, humans tend to be more comfortable with what they know. People are comfortable using fiat currencies, they are buying food and their morning cup of coffee with it. I think the saying goes - if it ain't broke then..create a Dapp that allows people to simply use a credit card to seamlessly access the Cardano ecosystem without even knowing it, or something like that.\n\nThe point is - credit cards are easy, accepted, and intuitive (did I mention easy?). By building a bridge between mainstream and Cardano with fiat, we believe this will significantly strengthen the viability of our Dapp immediately as well as in the future.\n\n \n\nWhy will Burblr provide maximum value for end users in 2021?\n\nSome of the most profitable apps that serve as the foundation of other ecosystems have one thing in common - they use gamification. Have you ever caught yourself in the iOS or Android store spending yet just a few more dollars to get that special item or unlock that new level? You're not alone - while it seems mundane, gamification is a truly intricate and profoundly effective way to get millions of people to engage (and have fun). Our unique approach to gamification is a key differentiator of Burblr that will drive growth, allowing for maximum value.\n\nIn addition, numerous Cardanians (and non but hopefully soon to be Cardanians) love to read. Burblr reimagines the reading and publishing experience in a whole new way while addressing piracy, freedom of expression, and for the first time ever - a way to capitalize on secondary market sales in perpetuity for authors and publishers (let's get the disrupting started). It also doesn't hurt that fees to use Burblr are dramatically more cost effective than other popular eBook and audio book platforms.\n\nWe know this (yes this, this whole journey we are all on together through the blockchain frontier) is new for everyone, why over complicate it when you don't have to? That's our sentiment with Bublr, a non-art NFT Dapp that makes the largest impact with the least amount of complexity by not reinventing the wheel, just making it more fun and effective.\n\n \n\nWhen will Burblr be publicly launched?\n\n• Burblr is expected to be publicly launched by the end of Q4 2021.\n\n \n\nWho is leading Burblr into battle?\n\nLouis\n\nLouis has held senior leadership positions in various capacities, including Operations, Finance, Sales, Marketing, Management, Product Development, and Partnership Acquisition.

With a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria requires up to 1.8 million units of blood every year to the health ministry. But experts say, Nigeria's National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) is collecting just 500,000 pints of blood annually – a shortfall of nearly 75%.\nUnderlining the need for blood donations is the fact that Nigeria has the fourth-highest maternal mortality rate in the world, accounting for 19% of all maternal deaths globally. Postpartum hemorrhages (the loss of too much blood following birth) is the leading cause of such deaths.\nBlood donation and transfusion has been reported to be underperforming in quality and ease of access to critical patients due to a factor of problems ranging from;\n• Persistent blood shortages coupled with increased poverty, creating another population of donors who give blood strictly for financial gratification.\n• Negligent healthcare system and lack of proper health insurance schemes nationwide.\n• Shortage of blood.\n• Poor implementation of blood transfusion guidelines.\n• Inadequate funding of NBTS leading to high blood prices.\n• Inadequate designated blood donation centers/facilities.\n• Low public awareness on non-remunerated blood donation arising from deep cultural myths and misconceptions.\nData On Blood Deficits\nA number of studies have shown factors leading to blood supply deficits. Below is a chart detailing the factors leading to supply deficits.\n• Fear of contracting TTIs (Transfusion-Transmissible Infections) (52.4%) Fear of side effects such as; • Weight loss (23.8%) • Sudden death (3.3%) • Sexual failure (5.9%) • High blood pressure (5.2%) • Concussions (1.5%)\nRedToken aims to tackle this problem by highlighting these solutions;\nAwareness :\nExplaining pedagogically why blood donations are needed and how blood is used to save lives.Fight cultural myths and misconceptions.\nAccess : Users can now know safe nearby hospitals/donation centers. Users can book visits to hospitals/donation centers.\nBlood Supply/Prices: Caused by various number of factors (like the problems listed above) leading to high blood prices in Nigeria.We aim to drive down blood prices in Nigeria by matching it's demand by providing supply to patients in need of it at much cheaper rates.\nBlood (Asset) Tracking: Users are given vital real-time information on what happens to their donation and the lives it helps save.This helps destigmatize the concept of blood donation in certain regions.\nToken Issuance Model\nRedToken aims to structure a model dedicated to selected regular donors that issues them (utility) tokens that can be used to pay for light utility bills like phone data bills, education, healthcare, and other needs.\nThis model mimics the structure of a typical blockchain, where a transaction is made and authenticated by multiple nodes (users on the network) before being issued a token.\nHow It Works\nThe user provides his blood and data that is given and confirmed to us by the donation center. It is sent to the blockchain, where it receives the data as a transaction, authenticates it and rewards the user with a utility token that can be used within the app's ecosystem. The hospital in need of blood supply can send and receive data/updates through an issued API.\nFuture\nRedToken hopes to continuously improve on it's model and expand beyond borders, explore other fields like the introduction of sachetized insurance packages to low income families. We also strive to implement our model onto different donating opportunities (eg, platelets, marrow, sperm donations) to the users/donors.\n**Also submitted to Blockchain for Social Good during WYOPHACKATHON. https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/RedToken-s-Blood-Donation-DApp/327279-48088**\nWe would also like to explore the opportunity or options to work with other proposals such as West Africa Decentralized Alliance, ABCD, Gimbalabs, ConversationalUI, IoT projects, and others.\nThrough our token, we aim to support other proposals and would also like to explore opportunities to help expand Cardano adoption and also help facilitate channel partnerships for EMURGO and IOHK.\nERGO is also something we would like to explore, specifically LETS, https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_cases/\nThere are potential opportunities to incorporate metadata into Redtoken.\nIN CLOSING: Nigeria is about to see an increase is outside funding initiatives and the public/private partnership sector is going to be the key to success. We are in talks with several FUNDS outside of catalyst and should be be funded here, or outside of Catalyst, it will strengthen the Cardano community and we would like to incorporate any outside funding into our project and also support others in the community and challenges.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/nigerias-82-billion-health-care-gap-investors-stand-by.html\nProject Brief: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zoAAOOvF6TZCQsyeDDLktayY4QpTVXg0oSPtwGeOoK0/edit?usp=sharing\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352327-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nWhat are we building?\nInterfaces to smart contracts, smart contracts for designers, creatives and artists (including the handling of NFTs)\nWhy are we building it ?\nCreatives, designers and artists , as seen through the new NFT craze can bring a lot of people to the platform. Currently the manner in which people use blockchains, is limited to hashing jpegs and uploading these as NFTs. However there are more sophisticated manners to do so, with new business models (where one creative publishes one idea/model/design/art piece, this gets tokenized, then a second one is able to pick that up and expand on it as a second token connected to the first one in a graph. ) This way and through setting up appropriate smart contacts for compensating the creatives/designers one can firestart an new collaborative effort for creatives, designers and visual artists on the Cardano blockchain where creative efforts are compensated fairly while still maintaining wide access to their work, and enabling a collaborative creative economy.\nHow will we use the funds?\n**Development time**\nSmart Contracts and User-space python tools that will be able to\n-create and track Intellectual property, NFTs, including re-mixing NFTs,\n- create proof of provenance for creative work\n- allows the signature and tracking of a creative work as it develops.\nThe main tool we will work with is Blender (www.blender.org), as it already supports python and is completely open source. We will also attempt to connect with Speckle(https://speckle.systems/), who provide a python connector and API and are also open source. On top of the @Arlav and @ Thomas we will onboard an additional developer that will work on both the smart contracts and python tools-connectors with blender.\n****Website & Visualisation prototype****Visualisation engine with marketplace attached, that allows you to navigate how a design or creative work was created. This can be used internally by designers and artists to create fruitful decentralised collaborations, while also allowing the Cardano audience to mint and buy NFTs out of a particular creative work at a particular point in time. The visualisation engine will visualise the creative process at all steps, while attributing authorship to each creative for the part that they did.\n-Legal advice for licences (to pay a consultation with a lawyer to discuss appropriate Creative licences for the original & remixed material created on the engine)\n-Node and server expenses for testing\n**Project Plan:**\n\nWP1: Smart contract and User Tools Architecture (graph explaining logic and strategy)\nWP2: Visualisation website workflow (design, mockups, code prototype)\nWP3: Smart contracts (writing, deploying to test-net, connection with user based tools, testing with users, iteration)\nWP4: User-based tools (python scripts on Blender, Sverchok-python scripts on Blender, testing with blender models)\nWP5: IPFS integration (Blender -IPFS integration, Visualisation Website-IPFS integration)\nWP6: Artists Testing\nLink to Work Packages, simple GANTT chart, Outputs for each WP and KPIs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IyMYFEv0nmNQ9YFTI-ir_ODOAoaGMo8tkqVk2ejwU24/edit?usp=sharing\nThe expected public launch date will be in September 1st sos that the Fund 5 governance phase is finished\nMetrics of Success\n1.Number of designers / creatives on-boarding and using the engine after the completion of testing.\n2.Number of NFTs minted on the platform\n3.Number of creative, collaborative projects launched on the platform\n4.ADA circulated through the platform\n5.Profit generated by the platform\nFinal Cost :\n188 Working Days : 47000\nInfrastructure\nIPFS System : 4800\nCardano Node : 500\nMonitoring System : 500\nWebsite : 200\nsummary : 51000\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352284-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352281-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nMission: To create self-governed markets around NFT assets.\nGoal: To build a fractional ownership token minting contract (when Alonzo goes live), pay for NFT storage (IPFS, Arweave), and design website.\nMosaic: a decentralized protocol built on Cardano where NFT artists and owners can mint fractional ownership tokens tied directly to their unique NFT's. These ownership tokens are Cardano native tokens and behave like Cardano's core token, ADA, affording them governance and staking capabilities. These affordable fractional ownership tokens paired with Cardano's ability to negate the environmental impact and gas fees associated with NFT's positions Mosaic as a perfect use case for Fund 5: DApps & Integrations, as it supercharges adoption for Cardano while highlighting some key elements of the protocol.\n-Benefits of Fractional Ownership-\nLiquidity & Volume Optimize Price Discovery and Royalties\nMinting multiple ownership tokens creates a miniature market that has enough liquidity to discover it's true price. With many buyers and sellers competing, the NFT can be priced accurately by the public, all while trading at a much higher volume than ever before. High volume means a lot of trading is happening, and since royalties are generated from every trade, the artist is passively earning crypto like never before.\n1/1 Editions Make Sense\nUniqueness doesn't demand exclusivity. Ownership tokens introduce an improved release mechanism to artists, since releasing a 1 of 1 edition won't sacrifice accessibility or earnings. Increased number of transactions and royalties, increased number of collectors holding your art, increased NFT adoption because entry is more affordable, increased uniqueness, what more could one ask for? One might wonder \"what's the difference between fractional ownership of a 1/1 edition and owning a 1/1000 edition?\" The answer lies in governance, a topic we touch on more later, but briefly, with ownership tokens you maintain the ability to consolidate ownership and even vote to sell the 1/1 edition to a solo buyer.\nAccessibility & Community\nEveryone has their own thoughts on what crypto represents. For us, a large part of it is giving the people the freedom to own their money and assets. With this line of thinking, we believe it's imperative that the CryptoArt scene doesn't become exclusive and toxified like much of the physical art market has. With fractional ownership, buyers earn the chance to purchase partial ownership in premium art for affordable prices, allowing people to support the artists they like and be a part of this wonderfully wacky movement. While making money is valuable, creating a supportive community of collectors that not only share a common interest in your work, but form a democratic body and economy around it is something in and of itself.\n-Roadmap-\n\n\nDevelop Website\n\n\nMinting Smart Contract - Beta\n\n\nNFT Data Storage with IPFS or Arweave\n\n\nBasic Selling Mechanism on User Profile\n\n\nMinting Smart Contract - Final\n\n\nRelease V1 -- July 4th, 2021 (V1 covered by this funding round)\n\n\nNFT Governance System\n\n\nMarketplace and/or Partnership with a Cardano DEX\n\n\nMarketing and Art Partnerships\n\n\nRelease V2 -- January 2022\n\n\nNFT Staking, Pooling and Collections\n\n\n$MOS Token Release\n\n\nRelease V3 -- April 2022\n\n\n-First Sprint-\nWebsite:\n\nLink Wallet to website\nWebsite minting UI (input number of tokens to mint)\nProfile page (owned tokens and their NFT)\nBasic \"For Sale\" placard (NFT displayed, total # of fractions, # for sale, cost, seller name, proof of ownership, Buy button)\n\nMinting fNFT Option 1 (pre-Alonzo update [no on-chain smart contracts]):\n\nUser initiates minting\nNFT sent to multisig address and private keys are minted (amount the user specified)\nNFT data is pinned to IPFS or arweave\n10% of tokens are sent to Mosaic Collection address\n90% of tokens are sent to user's linked wallet\n\nMinting fNFT Option 2 (smart contract):\n\nContract initiated\nNFT locked in escrow-like contract (only unlocked with a certain number of token signatures)\nTokens are minted (number input by user in website UI)\n10% of tokens are sent to Mosaic Collection address\n90% of tokens are sent to user's linked wallet\n\nSelling fNFT, simple escrow contract:\n\nOwner lists \"x\" number of tokens at a specified price\n\"x\" tokens are locked in escrow unless owner cancels\nBuyer links wallet, selects number of tokens to purchase and clicks Buy button\nIf they have enough funds, their funds are accepted by the escrow contract.

The proposed project will explore how to use the Cardano blockchain to make it possible to encode different portions of the genome as NFTs, so that the user can control who gets access to what, and under what terms.\nOur research shows that many people who have had their genome sequenced are willing to share it for medical research, in exchange for payment. Having sequenced their DNA, most people have stored their data files, with the hopes that they may be of use in the future. The challenge thus far has been for consumers to trust service providers with their data. Thanks to the Cardano blockchain and its affordable transactions, we see a sizeable opportunity offering the possibility to select portions of the genome that will be relevant to different R&D partners, and securing them on the blockchain so that individuals can choose which portions to share, and which to keep private.\nA simple personal genome-browsing app can give individuals the power to choose which Medical Research project to take part in, under what privacy terms and rewards.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352255-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\n*Raffly.io is the simplest version of of two applications to catalyst, the first being synthesis.finance in round 4 and raffley.io for round 5*\n- The concept with raffly.io is to work with the absolute basics of establishing and legally running a raffle on Cardano with any asset type.\n- Raffly.io will function as a platform that allows users to sell items from NFT's, artwork, cars, houses, crypto or anything that has value via a simple crowdfunded method.\n \nMore details to follow.\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352180-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352166-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEZ-Ticket (Tikkit.app)\nEvents tickets are a high volume potential use case for NFTs\n\nHow?\n\nBuild a NFT storefront that can add great value to ticketing companies and change conventional ticketing to smart ticketing.\n\nWhy?\n\n* With NFTs, smart tickets are verifiable, interoperable and have clear ownership.\n* A ticket doesn't need to die after being redeemed at an event. It can live on in digital wallets of the user's choice.\n* Current tickets themselves are collectable items memorializing events attended. NFT's make them even more so.\n* Large volumes of NFTs can be required for events and other purposes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPROJECT SCOPE\n\n* Build a ticketing specific DApp storefront and API on the NFT Framework Collab.\n* Deploy the server-side code in a decentralized network configuration.\n* Operate the client-side as a perpetual service to the Cardano community of developers and users. Provide support, maintenance and upgrades.\n\nBENEFITS\n\n* Creates a method for events, marketplaces or projects to mint and sell tickets with verifiable provenance.\n* Builds DApps on Cardano that prove the chain is attracting meaningful DApps.\n* Offers a business model extension to the NFT Framework we are building for the community.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\n* General Availability (GA) 3-months post funding.\n\nPLAN AND BUDGET\n\nPhase 1\n- Research and design the DApp and use cases\n- Market testing the concept and the potential uptake on the service\n(In process already within NFT-DAO working groups, and a test ticket for Akkadia is already an NFT)\n\n \n\nPhase 2\n- Prioritize Resource Utilization\n- Assign teams and workload\n- NFT-DAO will handle the commercialization (requirements, website, market research, partnerships, operations)\n\n \n\nPhase 3\n- Run Sprints to build all the logic components needed and the UX/UI\n\n \n\nPhase 4\n- Testing, Audit and hardening (dev/ops teams doing verification testing)\n\n \n\nPhase 5\n- Go Live (alpha and beta testing in real world conditions)\n\n \n\nPhase 6\n- G/A Launch (General Availability for developers to use)\nTotal: $29, 842 includes the initial development costs and operational costs for 3-month ramp.\n\nDEFINED SUCCESS REPORTING\n\n3-month: Post funding much of this work will be available to see firsthand and can be followed in the Github repository. The system should be up and running in General Availability (GA).\n6-month: Active and Fully Operational (FO).\n12-month: Working within the wider blockchain community with many of the list of collaborators listed below, and adopting our model for use with the wider community.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nTicket Dispenser—NFT Framework DApp\nTikkit.app will be one of the storefronts on the NFT Framework Collab. It will resemble https://www.nft.kred/events/tickets but on the Cardano blockchain and a better UX/UI and different features and use models. NFT.Kred is just an example.\n\nThe problems with traditional event ticketing\n\nInteroperability, scarcity and ownership don't exist on the internet, nor in traditional ticketing. Non-fungible tokens will shake up the ticketing industry and rival traditional companies like Eventbrite.\n\n \n\nCosts\nEvent organizers don't have it easy nowadays. They face high upfront costs as well as high risks such as terrorist threats, natural disasters or counterfeiting tickets. On top of that, promoters have to wait until ticketing companies payout ticket sales after the event has finished. Companies like Eventbrite take a high percentage of every ticket sold, which is usually between 2 and 3.5% on every sale, in addition to a set fee. What ticketing companies give in return is a digital ticket sales solution, marketing and sometimes – hardware scanners.\n\n \n\nScalpers and Authenticity\nAnother major issue is that tickets are sold on secondary markets for a much higher price and it is difficult to control who is buying, selling, or redeeming a ticket. On average, 12% of people buying concert tickets get scammed*. In short, the whole ticket sales cycle is a mess.\n\n \n\nWhere do NFTs come in?\nNFTs can add great value to ticketing companies and change conventional ticketing to smart ticketing. With NFTs, smart tickets are verifiable, interoperable and have clear ownership. A ticket does not die after being redeemed at an event but, lives on in digital wallets of the user's choice.\n\n \n\nCosts\nThe costs associated with building and minting non-fungible tokens is negligible, especially compared to traditional ticketing infrastructure. Structured correctly, hundreds or even thousands of NFTs (smart tickets) could be created for less than a couple of dollars. Not only do tickets cost less to produce, but they are also unforgeable – the event organizers can easily, quickly, and without a question validate the authenticity and history of ownership.\n\n \n\nScalpers and Authenticity\nThis is where the blockchain truly shines. Where re-sale is acceptable, using non-fungible tokens built on top of blockchain technology enables an end-user to verify and validate the authenticity of the ticket with absolute certainty.\nWhere scalping/resale of an event's ticket is strictly forbidden, and the event organizers can enforce this without error. NFTs can be made non-transferrable in computer code and prevent the transfer of tickets.\n\n \n\nNon-fungible tokens as event tickets in the wild\nThe first-ever NFT-exclusive ticketing is demonstrated on Cardano by NFT-DAO.\n\n \n\n* https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/13/about-12-percent-of-people-buying-concert-ticketsget-scammed-.html?utm_source=nonfungible\n\n \n\nGUIDING QUESTIONS\n\n++What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?++There are a few DApps that have wide adoption on other platforms. On is NFTs and marketplaces. This is a specific storefront for selling event and other ticket types that in themselves can become collectables.\n\n++What are the most profitable or most used applications on other ecosystems?++Clearly DEX and DeFi solutions are at the headwaters of the money stream and therefore the most profitable. Next to DeFi and related is the NFT market, not just art, but NFT solutions of all types will generate trillions in capital in the next decade.\n\nWhat needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?\nThey need a wide range of DApps similar to other blockchains.\n\n++What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?++The uses for tickets offers possibilities to create decentralized versions of things like EventBrite, not particularly highly technical, more utilitarian, but with a high revenue and volume potential.\n\n \n\nTEAM NFT-DAO\nOur team is drawing talent in at this writing over 320+ persons joined our NFT-DAO Discord. We're embracing everyone who strongly desires an overarching NFT framework on Cardano—especially those who proposed NFT solutions—and invite you to join our NFT DAO that will open-source the patterns we build as a community. Join us in a coordinated and consolidated effort. Others have already merged their proposal. You'll join:\n\nRich Kopcho, a life-long entrepreneur building 18 start-ups in his career. He has owned and managed a development shop and open-sourced the successful 'Restore' backup solution. He taught manufacturers around the world Holonic manufacturing (1997-2007); a heterarchical systems and technology approach that is the foundation DAOs are based on. He currently operates a venture studio in Laramie WY building technology solutions with partners. Rich is the executive producer of the Wyoming Blockchain Stampede - an annual conference by UWYO that IOHK/Cardano/Emurgo and others sponsor to educate the blockchain community.\n\nMichael Yagi, a senior software engineer with experience facilitating integration between different technologies across many different facets in a smooth, seamless fashion. He has a background in leading the development for projects that need to ship projects with many unknowns in a timely manner. His interest lie in building the bridge between the ocean and the pond (Cardano and \"traditional\" software engineering) as well as leveraging his game development background for NFT's in the game industry.\n\nTyler Wales, an entrepreneur with product development and management expertise, and experience bringing new solutions to market. He has launched multiple profitable businesses in media and technology and has established relationships in film production and distribution. Tyler is currently a mentor at Portland Incubator Experiment.\n\nCommunity Members n+1, is passionate about NFTs and has aligned themselves to a previous proposal seeking funding for a NFT point solution. They are eager to build their business model on top of a solid framework. Since none has existed for Cardano, they were planning to build one for themselves from scratch. They are one of ~300 individuals who could potentially pool their expertise into an all-embracing open-source version to benefit the entire community rather than one project. Their expertise is multivariate in development, SPO, marketing, design, business, and more.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352152-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352031-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nFurther Context - The base\nSPRD advances the delegation process of Cardano. In the software, users can give their \"commitment of delegation\" without a real delegation and each \"commitment\" will be registered by SPRD. If there are enough \"committed delegators\" collected then all of them are notified by email, telegram, or something similar. Enough \"committed delegators\" means who have in sum the minimum ADA in order to let a pool mint a block and to get rewards.\nThis process will guarantee with any delegation to fulfill the minimum ADA before the delegation happens.\nWhen smart contracts are available then the delegation will automatically happen without the need for notifications which improves trust and automation.\n\n \n\nAttract \"Commiters\" in the first place\nUsers may not use the software because of a lack of motivation, but here comes a bonus feature that will attract them:\nPool operators themselves can register within the software and define prices, some examples:\n\nThe very first \"commiter\" will get 50 ADA when we mint the first block\nThe first 5 \"commiter\" will get 10 ADA when we mint the first block\nThe first \"commiter\" who owns more than 100.000 ADA will get 50 ADA for 2 epochs when we mint blocks\nAll the \"commiter\" will get 5 ADA when we mint the first block\nAll the \"commiter\" will get the whole pool rewards equally splittet when we mint the first block. Example: when the pool gets 400 ADA of the first minted block and there were 10 \"comitters\" then everyone gets 40 ADA\n\n \n\nIn this way the user is attracted by the prices and the pool operators can afford them since it's related to the condition when the pool gets rewards.\n\nThis will be implemented by a smart contract to ensure trust and automation.\n\n \n\nPrevent scamming\n\nThe logic behind starting with a desktop app is due to validation limits on server-hosted APIs vs Daedalus wallet API. In order to prevent scamming we can verify on the desktop app if the current user has access to a wallet with a specific ADA. On server-hosted API there is no way to prevent users from faking to be the owner of a wallet with 500k ADA, the only way would be to transfer ADAs but this will increase costs by transaction fees and therefore not applicable.\nWe aim definitely to find a thin client (web) solution while Cardano APIs are evolving.\nWhile waiting for smart contract to be available we are facing another scamming issue when users are not delegating what they \"committed\"\nIf one person of the delegators that did \"commit\" does not delegate at all and changes their mind then this wallet will be blocked for a time period and will be internally ranked lower. But Goguen (smart contracts) in May would solve it because delegation will happen automatically.\nThe same example is true for pool operators which are offering prices. (see above)\n\nWhat pools is the software showing and in other words recommending?\nThe software could show with no filters all Cardano stake pools, but the software will have default filters in for supporting a better decentralization.\nThose default filters are:\n\nHaving less than 100% block chance\nSingle pool operator\nIf a cloud hoster is used then it would show a more negative ranking to the user if the hoster is used by a lot of others in the Cardano network*\n\n*https://nasec.co.uk/2020/12/28/cardano-decentralisation/\n\nWorkflow\n\nUser opens SPRD application\nUser finds an interesting cardano stake pool with a live stake of 500.000 ADA\nUser shows his interest by \"commit\" his 150.000 ADA to this pool within SPRD\nOn the blockchain, nothing happened so far\nAnother user shows his interest by \"commit\" his 350.000 ADA to this pool within SPRD\nAnother user shows his interest by \"commit\" his 500.000 ADA to this pool within SPRD\nNow the live stake plus all the \"committed\" ADA will have the minimum reached.\nSPRD will send notifications to the \"committed\" delegators in order to delegate the ADA.\nAll delegators manually delegate their ADA (Prototype already published in April)\nWhen smart contracts are ready then the delegation will happen automatically in order to guarantee trust and automation.\nSoon the pool mints blocks and everybody gets rewards.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nJan 2021: The idea of SPRD is born (done)\nFeb 2021: Cardani API capability was approved to fulfill requirements of SPREAD (done)\nMar 2021: Collected beta testers, found co-developer for server-side, implemented client desktop alpha version. (done)\nApr 2021: Publish desktop client and server beta versions. (done)\nMay 2021: Researching website solutions for replacing desktop clients.\nMay 2021: Extend desktop client with pool operators to offer prices.\nMay 2021: Start implementing smart contract if Cardano Goguen test net is ready.\nJune 2021: Replacing server-side with the smart contract if Cardano Goguen mainnet is ready.\nJuly: Continue to research website solutions and implement if ready.\n\nMore on the website: https://sprd-pool.org/#roadmap\n\nFunds\n\nThe funds will be used to finance the development, management, and marketing until publishing. Also, the infrastructure costs like Website and SPRD server hosts will be covered.\n\n \n\nThe calculation for the first 1 year (261 working days) for Developer, Marketing, management and research with costs of 115 $ per hour comes to the sum of 30.000 $\nThis ensures the finished development with smart contracts, maintaining the software and giving support.\n\nIn the second year there are two possibilities for being valued of the time invest in SPRD:\n\nI run a Cardano stake pool called [SPRD] and when minting blocks the rewards can be used to maintain the SPRD software\nIf case one is not fulfilled then provision costs are added for stake pool operators when a not minting block was successfully funded within the SPRD software. Example: Stake pool XY mints his first block then SPRD will get 25% of the epoch rewards, in the case of 400 ADA total pool rewards this would be 100 ADA.\n\n \n\nWhich of these definitions apply to you?

We have consulted on multiple defi projects. However, as ETH's infrastructure is lacking, a lot of the DeFi space is looking to Cardano. We have built the first and main Cardano launchpad providing us access to all the developers in the space that will be first to launch on Cardano when the mainnet is live. This access along with our experience provides us with the opportunity to optimize the user experience for Cardano users and developers. The marriage of these two worlds occurs with the use of the web browser/extension wallet. The Ethereum equivalent of our Gero Wallet (named after Gerolama Cardano) is the well-known metamask wallet. The revenue for such wallets is related to transaction fees which can be mitigated with the use of holding our ADA-based token.

We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized app allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.\n \nThe goal of this Fund5 proposal is to get resources for our initial phases which include the development of a Minimum Viable Product (or MVP) as a proof of concept (PoC). We plan on building a webapp without any blockchain at first, just back-end logic, for faster prototyping. It will, of course, later be converted to the Cardano blockchain. We have started hiring a development company to be actively working on the project. This MVP will help demonstrate the basic functionalities of two user personas (Donor and Organization) first.\n \nThis MVP will allow us to demonstrate the benefits of iGIVit and increase traction of potential partners, investors and charity organizations. We are already in early discussions with the Canadian Red Cross for implementing some of their campaigns into our solution.\n \nWe are personally fronting the money to pay for developers to materialize our MVP, and the funds we ask for through this proposal will help cover these initial costs. For the initial phase, we are asking for 20,416.00$ USD.\n \nYou can see more details below or directly in the spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AmTc_Wd-fCToCF37u3KvxYiA27Wm9VrIedPM7lBjV8U/edit?usp=sharing\n \nRemember to vote for us so we can make donations better!\nThank you for visiting! Leave us a comment.\n \nThe iGIVit team\n\"And if you'll permit us we'd like to change the world\" ?\nWell, this might be one good start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONG VERSION:\nOverview:\nCurrently, when giving to a charity, it is very hard to know how the funds are really being used. This opacity in the donation process prevents a lot of people from making contributions. Now, imagine being able to know exactly, and with absolute certainty, how your donation is making a difference in the real world.\nWith iGIVit, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing financial assistance and/or emergency relief to the people and communities in need. We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized application allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-user value:\nOnce fully deployed, iGIVit will help in more than one way:\n- Bring back integrity, transparency and accountability into the donation process and;\n- Become a leading donation platform in the philanthropic space; where charities and other organizations will be running all their campaigns on our solution.\nWe strongly believe that iGIVit is a great use-case for the adoption of blockchain and its underlying Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). By being very easy to use and by giving the ability to witness, in real-time and with 100% certainty, how the donations are used, iGIVit will be a great tool to demonstrate the true wonders of the technology.\nIn time, the general public will realize that blockchain-based organizations offer so much more than regular charities that the balance of donated wealth will start to shift.\nWhat's more, iGIVit will provide a thorough search engine that will allow you to find new charities to give to, even if they're not blockchain-based. For those latter ones, iGIVit will automatically forward the donation to the charity's account (minus minuscule processing fees). If the organization is not showing in the search results, it can be added very easily by the user itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage:\nHere are two examples of the main features the platform can be used for in order to improve the donation process:\nFinancial aid\n- This is the most simple example. If the end-goal is to give money then the funds get transferred to the wallet of the person in need, for them to spend as they please. Every transaction is displayed transparently on the blockchain. There is no need for an auditor.\nEmergency relief\n- If the goal is, for example, to feed villagers, then every step of the process will be displayed on the blockchain. For this to be validated with great certainty and to avoid fraudulent claims, a 3rd party Auditor will need to assess and approve the various steps involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoadmap:\nHere's an overview of the road ahead. Everyone will be able to follow the progress of the build on both our website (https://igivit.org) or Github repository (https://github.com/lokdao/igivit).\nPhase 1 - Proof of Concept - April 2021 (in progress):\n- Applying for Fund5 (hi!)\n- Subcontracting external developers to help us build the Proof of Concept (or PoC) as a high-fidelity prototype with all user personas: Donor, Recipient, Organization, Employe, Supplier and Auditor. This PoC will be a web-based app that won't yet be connected to a blockchain and won't have a FIAT on/off-ramp. The delivery for this phase is planned for the end of May 2021.\nPhase 2 - Complete solution build - May and June 2021\n- After receiving Fund5 resources, we will initiate Phase 2 which is two-fold:\n- Demo the PoC to internal parties and make modifications following comments.\n- Start attaching the whole ecosystem onto a blockchain. Part of our team is currently taking part in the Plutus Pioneer Program in order to build it directly on Cardano.\nOnce completed, Phase 2 will deliver a functional MVP that can then be used to demonstrate the value proposition and attract investors and potential partners.\nPhase 3 - The Alonzo Era - July, August 2021\n- Finish transferring the app on Cardano using Plutus\n- Integration with Atala Prism for decentralized identity\n- Make UX improvements and UI advanced design\n- Perform Quality Assurance (QA)\nPhase 4 - Hello World - September, October 2021\n- Go Live: Launch the first real-world campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of success:\n- 3 months: In three months, we will be converting the PoC into the Cardano blockchain using Plutus/Marlowe so a success marker would be that the PoC has done its job well and we pursuing the goal.\n- 6 months: In November, if all goes well, our first real-world campaign will have been launched 1 month prior. This will stress-test our solution for field use. It will be a great milestone and also a great source for improvement ideas.\n- 12 months: May 2022. iGIVit will start to get traction as we can demonstrate the various campaigns it helped manage and the growing adoption of it for making those donations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team:\nDavid Poulin or @mrvaralta (https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-poulin/) used to be a Creative Director for Cirque du Soleil. Being a crypto enthusiast and a Cardano fan, the pandemic pushed him to write down the initial idea for iGIVit in a white paper and to design paper-prototypes (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bD-l9eQOUmiRrg_eE2SFA4Rk9OCh2Gc?usp=sharing). Even though he's not from the dev world, he has a very good understanding of this emerging technology and the new possibilities it can offer to the world.\nLudovic Grandclement or @gildor (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludovicgrandclement/) is an experienced Project Manager as well as owning a Master's Degree in Computer Science. What's more: he got accepted into the first cohort of the Plutus Pioneer Program.\nThe two joined forces during the Fund3 proposal process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges and Roadblocks:\nMany challenges and roadblocks exist on our path to successfully reach our goal. Here's a brief description of some of them, in no particular order.\nChallenge 1 - Fraudulent/Untruthful ledger entries or claims\nTo deliver funds to a person in need is relatively straightforward as we can easily verify the transfer of values on the blockchain as long as we have proof of their true identities (we are looking at implementing Atala Prism for this portion of the challenge).\nHowever, when trying to deliver physical help in the field (building shelters, serving food, etc) it is much more difficult to prove that non-digital actions really took place. To overcome this challenge, we are implementing a multi-signature process where both the Organization's campaign manager and an independent Auditor need to confirm the truthfulness of the action item being forever written on the blockchain.\nChallenge 2 - Partial Centralization\nSome level of centralization will unfortunately need to be present in order for a charity to manage their own campaigns. But we believe that the transparency of the blockchain coupled with the aforementioned Auditor process, will bring enough accountability into the system for the general public to get a heightened sense of trust towards the whole process.\nChallenge 3 - Large endeavour\nOur project is not small. There is a lot that needs to be accomplished and it has lots of potential ramifications that we are not aware of. We are then taking it one baby step at a time. Building the house brick by brick instead of throwing a tarp over some branches. That's why we are splitting the work in distinct phases.\nChallenge 4 - Reliance on sub-contracted dev teams\nWe want to be 100% transparent regarding our capabilities. Our core team is not made of pure coders. In order for us to succeed in creating this ambitious project, we sub-contracted a dedicated dev team that will enable us to demonstrate to the world the possibilities offered by iGIVit.\nChallenge 5 - Legal monetary issues (doing philanthropy in all regions of the world)\nRight now, questions arise about the legality of using cryptocurrency to deliver humanitarian aid to any parts of the world. This challenge is currently being addressed within our team as an on-going research. The solution will emerge in a later phase of the project.\nOne thing is for sure, in order to secure the value of the donated money, the use of a stable coin is inevitable.\nChallenge 6 - Identity proof\nOne major challenge is to get absolute proof of the identities of the people and organizations taking part in our ecosystem. As we mentioned before, in order to be able to trust that help is really being carried out to the right people, a decentralized identity system needs to be used. All parties involved are then becoming owners of their own information; their own identities. Again, Atala Prism is so far the best example of such a system that could potentially be integrated into iGIVit once we deploy on the Cardano blockchain.\nOne added benefit is that, while providing humanitarian help, it also provides greater freedom and possibilities to the affected people and their local communities through identity ownership.\nChallenge 7 - Adoption by organizations\nOf course, some organizations might not want to open their books so wide and so transparently to the world. They might prefer to remain opaque in order to keep more money for other things than helping the needy. Our vision is that, over time, the donors to these charities will switch to iGIVit for a better way of giving. The opaque organizations might find themselves forced to adopt blockchain in order to remain relevant.\nChallenge 8 - Blockchain choice\nEven though we will be building the PoC with backend logic only first in order to get a working prototype faster, meaning without any blockchain, inevitably we are going to migrate to the only blockchain worth building on: Cardano. Our legendary 3rd generation protocol is the perfect backbone for our entire system because it is built the right way; because it is built for centuries. But we are preaching to the choir…\nBuilding our solution in two separate steps will create a layer of complexity to the process as we will need to find time and resources to do the switch. But we believe the advantages outweigh the drawbacks so that's why we are moving forward with this plan.\nChallenge 9 - Competition\nRight now, there are very few places to donate where blockchain is used to guarantee and show the usage of said funds. The biggest one being Binance Charity (https://www.binance.charity/) . Even though it is one of the biggest crypto exchange in the world, the reach of its campaigns and the thoroughness of what is available to monitor seems pretty limited and we believe this is where our solution will shine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget:\nWe already have committed personal money into this adventure in order to showcase the basic functionalities and the seriousness of our intentions, but, in order to move forward, we need more funds and that is why we are asking for the approval of 20,416.00$ USD during this Fund5 process.\nHere is a simplified version of our intended use of the funds. If you prefer, you can see the full budget details in the attached spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AmTc_Wd-fCToCF37u3KvxYiA27Wm9VrIedPM7lBjV8U/edit?usp=sharing).\nPhase 1 budget breakdown\nDefinitions and Initial Design: $ 5,200.00\nArchitecture, wireframes: $ 12,860.00\nBasic infrastructure (website server, etc): $ 500.00\nContingency (10%): $ 1,856.00\nTotal costs: $ 20,416.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nWith iGIVit, members of the general public will finally be able to see with their own eyes how their money is really being used, what actions have been taken, who received the intended help, all in fine details. This emerging blockchain technology will then be used to create real improvements for real people; real changes in the real world.\nBy tackling challenges of the 3rd sector (philanthropy) head-on, we believe that one day, iGIVit will become the reference in money donations.\n \nThanks:\nThank you so much for taking the time to read our proposal. If you like it, if you have a comment, if you have a question or if you are interested in joining us, we would be happy to hear from you. Send us a message!\nFinally, you can help make a difference by voting for us on the Catalyst App or directly within the Yoroi Extension.\n \nThe iGIVit team\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351711-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351697-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nProblem Statement - High Fees, Centralized and not User Friendly\n\nMany art marketplaces do not put users first: they have high commission fees, they are hard to navigate, they are heavily curated and last but not least - centralized. We noticed that the business models of current NFT marketplaces don't have a long-term, sustainable focus. They are saturated with digital artworks of varying quality and a lot of great pieces get buried in the sea of transactions created by the existing quick buy-and-sell hype. Moreover artists are easy to impersonate, and there's a lack of awareness in the NFT community about NFT copyright and ownership. Existing NFT platforms generate profit through exclusive art auctions or through large volumes of NFT sales on platforms with low security. All this compromises the platform's content and transactions become profit-driven.\n\nArtano is the Solution!\n\nArtano is democratizing art. We want to create opportunities for artists from all backgrounds and open up the space to a global artist population. Our aim is to make a platform which ensures the safety of our users through security mechanisms, the council of artists and collectors, and our curators. We will involve the community in the decision making process of our platform and all users who engage in transactions will be able to acquire a token that will allow them to vote on features of the platform. Artano will be a safe platform to sell art on and it will address most of the usability and scaling issues that current NFT platforms face! We're already on our way to create an affordable, sustainable and most importantly - community-driven platform in the Cardano space.\n\nArtano applied for Fund 3, and we received over 320 Million ADA in votes, placing us in 6th place overall. We were humbled by the incredible amount of support from the members of the Cardano community, who, with their votes, showed a deep level of trust in our vision and team, believing we would be able to deliver the safest, most equitable and user-friendly platform that deals with NFTs. Despite not being funded, we defined the MVP and our business model, interviewed more than 15 potential members of our council, started building the website, and we're looking for partners within the blockchain and art/collector space. The success of Artano looks brighter than ever!\n\nWho's Making Artano Happen?\n\nWe have a diverse team from all over the world that will be able to deliver a DApp from start to finish, including four developers, one business/financial analyst, one in-house designer, one content manager and one product manager. Moreover, the dev team is working on the Plutus Test program.\n\nHere's our team (in alphabetical order):\n\nEdgar (Head of Design) - Edgar is our graphic designer based in Valencia, with 10 years of experience in the art world. He worked with more than 100 clients, including big European festivals, advising them on graphic design. He takes inspiration to create designs and art collections from his personal life. He is one of the new core members of the Artano Team.\n\nMarija (COO) - Marija has experience in audit and management consulting, with an inside view of the startup ecosystem, refining the business model and market positioning. She has worked on engagements for European companies in the healthcare, energy, media and entertainment industry. She was involved in building long-term business plans, and she has experience in advising companies on growth and development strategies.\n\nMateja (CEO) - Mateja/Matt is a Serbian-born, American-educated full-stack software developer, an activist and an agile advocate. He brought the team together with the idea of building an affordable, user-friendly and collaborative NFT marketplace. He has worked for one of the biggest automotive clients in the world and for one of the biggest insurance companies in Europe. He's the product owner, the brains behind the planning, communication and development of Artano.\n\nMohammed (Lead Content Manager) - After spending over a decade creating content for a wide spectrum of industries, Mohammed knows what truly drives online conversations and how to turn those conversations into support. He creates and nurtures stories that connect effectively with the needs of the people. His clients include multiple universities and research institutes in Qatar, bio-tech and medicine industry leaders, as well as magazines and news outlets.\n\nRon (CPM) - Ron has 25+ years International IT experience and a technical background in computer science. His role includes managing planning and setting requirements with the dev team. He has helped in the successful execution of several projects, such as an art framework for high-end art and the Delegation Tracker on Cardano. He's the backbone of our product and our needs to the dev team. Ron has been in the Cardano ecosystem since early 2017.\n\nSandip (CTO) - Sandip built his first Bitcoin payment system back in 2015/2016! He's been in the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano space for years. Sandip is managing our development team and making technical decisions. Sandip & Ron form an experienced team working together for several years on a daily basis. They created multiple startups, one of which is active in the blockchain space and created a framework for security tokens and high-end art on basis of Ethereum.\n\nArtano's 2-person dev team via Ron & Sandip (2 developers, for now) - Artano's dev team has 5+ years experience in blockchain smart contract development on Ethereum. Artano's dev team built several successful cloud native platforms, mobile solutions and wallets under the leadership of Sandip and Ron. In mid-2020 the team decided to take some time to deeply understand Cardano. The team consists of devs with deep cryptographic knowledge, programming in several languages, and have machine learning and AI skills.\n\n20 council members: the council will comprise a group of traditional and digital artists from different regions of the world, with different levels of experience and exposure. They will help us curate art and accelerate the growth of Artano, as well as help us create unique collections and stir the global art scene towards the NFT space.\n\nWhat Have We Done so Far?\n\na) Interviewed potential council members, currently pending the final decision. They're a diverse group of people from all over the world and from traditional to digital backgrounds. Below you'll find some examples of people we've interviewed:\n\n- Two Motion Designers + one musician/designer from the UK\n- One designer from Ghana\n- An indiginous Santhal film maker in India\n- An artist collective from Paris\n- A 3D architect from Rhode Island\n- A CGI art school teacher from Paris\n- A traditional artist from Belgium\n- And many more…\n\nb) We've done a user survey of ~70 artists and collectors within (and outside) the NFT space. We wanted to hear the opinions and ideas from the community in order to be able to match them up with our own ideas and define the future direction of the Artano NFT marketplace. We had many responses and we continue to have one on one meetings with artists to understand their needs. You can answer the survey here: https://forms.gle/sPqR6fHwtkML7ssY8\n\nc) We're working hard to get our website live, and Edgar is a dedicated designer working on this as we write this proposal. Stay tuned and we'll keep you updated for when the website is officially launched.\n\nd) We had two conversations with the IOHK/IOG's executive team about sustainability issues of NFT platforms and how we can make Artano last longer than the current trend.\n\nWhat is Artano Doing to Benefit Artists and Collectors?\n\nFull transparency: we will be completely transparent about our decisions and features once we've built our MVP. We will communicate all potential changes to our users and they will eventually be able to vote on what they would like to see on Artano using a governance token.\n\nDiversity: We want to be an NFT platform that's open to the world! Our goal is to assemble a geographically diverse group of artists and collectors on the council and as curators. This approach ensures that Artano is able to invite people from all over the globe into our NFT ecosystem, no matter their socio-economic status, or any other barrier that prevents them from joining the current NFT platforms.\n\nFraud-reduction efforts: We'd like to protect our users against impersonation and fraud through legal protection or economic incentives (we are an integrity-first platform). We want to prevent impersonation, low-quality work (spam) and minting copies of copyrighted work. Currently this is work in progress for which we are consulting with external advisors since it requires specific domain expertise. This is possibly one of the hardest parts of our solution to make Artano sustainable beyond the current NFT hype.\n\nUser-first approach: Artano will always put the users first. We want you to feel as part of a community that's greater than an NFT trend. We're starting an art revolution that will bring jobs to thousands if not millions of artists world-wide, where people get to keep a fair share of the pieces they've sold.\n\nCreating new opportunities for artists: We believe in partnerships and looking at existing startups and projects that are open to collaborating with Artano. Our goal is to provide artists with more opportunities via these collaborations. We will also create special events and collections that will help promote artists and their art.\n\nWhat's Artano's Edge Compared to Other Platforms?\n\nArtists come first: Artists will always be at the center of what Artano does.We tailor our platform to the needs of artists and collectors, collaborate with artists from different backgrounds for our initial art release and nurture a close-knit community that will put collaboration over personal gain.\n\nA Council of artists, collectors and curators: The first step to decentralization is to partially shift decision-making processes from the core Artano team to the artists and collectors themselves. The role of a council member is to be the connection between the Artano team and our users. The initial council members will be selected by the Artano team with the expectation to help us bootstrap our solution, bring their connections to mint on Artano and help us define our MVP. They will also be our first curators, filtering artists for fraud (though they won't be the only filtering mechanism).\n\nThe community will later have the power to vote using a governance token. They can replace these members with an entirely new council, or choose to disassemble the council altogether. Furthermore, council members will communicate new features to be developed on Artano to the core team through the community that can later vote on which ones they like the most. In short, the council represents an organized communication and curation channel that drives the development of Artano.\n\nCuration of users by users: A separate curator role will come later down the line, given to trusted members of the Artano community (all initial council members are also curators). The primary objective of a curator is not to exclude people, but to be able to vouch for the user they verify and create a community of trusted members. Users will be able to become curators through meaningful contributions to the platform (such as buying/selling art, bringing on more community members) and by holding a certain amount of our token they've earned by participating on Artano. The curators will be rewarded for bringing artists only upon successful first sale of their artwork. This means they won't be rewarded just by bringing people to Artano - they have to make a successful sale. The curators will take a percentage of the first successful art sale, and no further awards will be given to curators.\n\nDiscoverability: It should be easy for users of the Artano platform to find art. Many existing NFT solutions don't have effective search features. Our goal is to lead by example of good discoverability.\n\nWe take ZERO minting fees: Minting of NFTs on Artano is free, except for the minimum ADA taken upon a transaction by the Cardano blockchain.\n\nA Thought-out Approach: We will take our time to deliver a stable, scalable and sustainable solution. We were here before the NFT craze, and we plan to stay long after the bubble pops (and it will certainly pop).\n\nLegality issues - Solved: We are trying to figure out the best way to solve the ownership issues of current platforms and to offer a terms of use that is clearly communicated with our users, both artists and collectors. Our community members should know exactly what they're buying and selling and what they can do with the rights they have. As we've mentioned above, we want to protect our members against fraud, impersonation, and breach of the terms of use by other actors in the system through special legal and economic incentives.\n\nInformative material: We don't want our users to fend for themselves in the NFT wilderness. We want to educate every single one of them about the simplest things like \"how to mint an NFT\", \"what are the copyright and IP terms of Artano\", to the more technical stuff like \"what type of NFT standard we want to use\". We will use materials such as infographics, videos and simplified literature. We will address the issue of copyright and ownership to enable various kinds of transactions, while making the terms of use as clear as possible to our users. This is a great opportunity to both educate and empower the community and we want to be on the forefront of this movement!\n\nLow tolerance to low quality content: We will filter out profiles that spam with low quality, copyrighted, offensive or otherwise undesirable content. We will use our unique curation system to identify who recommended the artist onto the platform in case of them causing trouble. This is not to punish the curator or artist - we want to learn how the curation process can be improved and what we can do better going forward. No other platform has this mechanism so far.\n\nCosts:\n\nWe will be applying to Project Catalyst more regularly to fund Artano. This breakdown will bootstrap our development for the first 2-3 months and help us build the website and some back-end API's.\n\nOur total ask is $20,000\n\nBreakdown of the funds requested:\n- 2 developers working full-time for 2 months - $16,000\n- 1 Designer for the development of our branding strategy and website - $2,000\n- 1 Content Lead to help us accelerate our growth organically, and help with the \"hype\" around the platform - $2,000\n\nWe are aware that the funds requested won't be enough to cover a large part of development, but it will be enough to get us started, work on the MVP and initial content creation as well as get some great people on board in making Artano come to life!\n\nWe are also looking for funding primarily from global VCs and we'll keep you updated on any developments in that area.\nThe co-founders of the company, Mateja, Sandip, Ron and Marija don't expect to be compensated by the funds received from Project Catalyst. These funds will be invested into developing Artano and compensating team members involved in initial design and marketing efforts.\n\nSo you'll have a governance token?\n\nYes, we are planning to have a mechanism that will reward participants on our platform. We cannot disclose too much here yet, as that could undermine our business in the future, so we appreciate your patience regarding the tokenomics.\n\nWhat's the roadmap like?\n\nWe're currently discussing the idea of dividing Artano into different phases (we call them \"chapters\"). This is our current timeline, but we're aware that things change quickly in the startup world. For reference, we call different art styles \"universes\".\n\nChapter One (July/August '21):\n\n- Working on several exhibitions that will launch within the first few weeks of Artano. Our first Artano-sponsored collection will push the understanding of NFT's forward. We want to revolutionize not only the NFT marketplace space, but the art world in general. Stay tuned in the following weeks for the first Artano collaboration that aims to shift the NFT space forward!\n- The council is established and our members are ready to invite their connections to Artano.\n- The Visual Art Universe released, so that people are able to mint and trade their pieces\n- The users can buy and sell art using ADA\n- NFT Discovery I (one) - The first phase of discoverability will be a user feature that allows them to find art more easily, something that current platforms lack\n- Social features like likes, shares, views, follows, etc will be available from day one.\n\nChapter Two (December '21)\n\n- Governance Token has been released in the first airdrop to existing users who have helped Artano grow in it's initial phases by participating on the platform.\n- First vote on disassembling the council/Creating a new Council…\n- Phase II Discovery - we add new features to enable users to find art more easily, including some ML/AI code.\n\nChapter Three (June '22)\n\n- Music, Photography and Video Universes released\n- NFT Discovery III \n \n\nAI/ML now a serious part of our platform. Personas defined, users are able to get art recommended based on previous art they've seen.\n\n- Video-oriented art projects and collaborations started\n\n- Enable models to find work on the platform\n\n- Music labels enter the picture, it's an additional channel for collaboration\n\nThe following developments are a bit far in the future, as we're still discussing the future of Artano, but here's what we planned:\n\nChapter Four (December '22)\n\n- Literature universe released\n- NFT Discovery Phase IV\n- More features TBD\n\nChapter Five (June '23)\n\n- Gaming Universe released (think integration with items, skins, loot-boxes)\n- NFT Discovery improvements and tweaks\n- More features TBD\n\n \n\nHow can I help?\n\nJoin the conversation: You can join the conversation on Telegram (artanonftmarketplace), Reddit (r/artano) or Twitter (@artano__io)!\n\nHelp us get funding: You can suggest a seed investor/incubator or a personal connection that might be interested in a project such as Artano!\n\nFind potential Artists for our council: If you know artists with special skills (like a traditional art form or an art that's hard to find) or you know an artist with substantial social media following, please reach out to one of us, so we can consider them for our council.\n\nVOTE!: This one is obvious, but vote for us on Project Catalyst!\n\nAnd again, To Conclude and thank you for going through this proposal with us\n\n \n\nArtano already set us out on an incredible journey. We've met many amazing people along the way, from creatives to technologists, and we built a small community around us that makes us want to deliver this project even more!\n\nAt this point it's all about patience, and being able to deliver a solution that will outlast the NFT bubble - a platform that people will know as the #1 NFT Art DApp, where art and artists will be respected and low-quality, make-a-quick-buck content frowned upon.\n\n \n\nSee you on the other side of the Artanoverse!\nThe Artano Team","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351682-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nDisclaimer - ALL Artworks are just mood concepts and can differ little in detail from the final version -\n\nCombine blockchain technology with NFTs in a mobile environment\nModular development strategy with three Phases\nPre-Sale, NFT Marketplace, Native App for Android and iOS\nQUEST already a Stake pool!\n\nWebsite WIP: www.ada-quest.com\n\n \n\nTeam\nCoding: Dirk worked for Ubisoft, founded two gaming studios as a Dev Lead, and is currently working as a Technical Architect.

In the past 10 years, he has helped some start-ups in their initial phase. Michael is the second guy and mainly responsible for game design and balancing. He holds a degree in business administration and had a lot of experience as a QA Tester in the EA environment. Both OG´s love to crunch numbers, always try to find out which RPG class is the best of all times. The struggle is still going on…\n\n \n\nOperations & Story: Thomas is the oldest and financial expert within the team. His knowledge about movies, games, and fantasy worlds is immense. He currently tries to tie the stitches to bring the world of ADA to life.\nOverall we offer more than 100 years(!cumulated!) of professional gaming and business experience. We all are old school gamers(started in the mid '80s), played a lot of pen&paper RPGs, love tabletop games, and of course strategy. This project will be something like our legacy. Ada Quest will not only be for the masses, we are developing this title because we like to play our own games. Maybe one day you will meet us on the battlefield or in a dungeon, cave, tavern you name it ;)!\n\n \n\nStory\nWelcome to the legendary world of ADA.\nIt is epoch 259! Long before this time, there was a huge war in ADA, which completely cast a spell over the land. It was about the most powerful gemstone, the Goguen Stone! Whoever possessed this stone would be the absolute ruler of this world. Nevertheless, in the greatest battle, the Goguen Stone shattered into four pieces.\nAfter this bloody encounter, a mage, a barbarian, a dwarf, and an elf were each able to take possession of one of these shards. In order not to devastate the land any further, the four heroes agreed to a truce and founded the first four realms.\nNow you have arrived on ADA and it is up to YOU to choose your hero and your destiny. Prove your skills and courage in duels and quests to finally conquer this world! But watch out, ´cause nothing is as it seems. An unrecognized greater threat lurks in the darkness, which wants to use this legendary world for its intrigues.\nStart your QUEST for ADA now…\nEstimate Roadmap\n2021 Q2:\n\nCreating token(done)\nFinalizing story and the world (assets creation, English version)\nBackend coding (shop system, account-management, marketplace for NFTs)\nFrontend coding (web-based, ready for native)\nCreating the first draft of quality hand-drawn artworks for sale\nStart pre-selling NFTs\n\n2021 Q3\n\nStarting to port to a native app (Android)\nCreating further quality artworks for the NFT marketplace\nHiring further people\n\n2021 Q4\n\nFinalizing the game for release\nPorting to iOS (Apple)\nLocalize into german language\nModular development strategy with three Phases\n\nInside Phase Overview\nPhase I (Initial NFTs pre-selling) - Q2 2021\n\nCreating quality artworks and selling them as unique In-game characters ready to be used within the game!\nOfficial founding/running our development studio\nCollecting more funds for the Next Phase\n\nPhase II (Creating a native marketplace) - Q3 2021\n\nOffering new Items, Quest tokens, further heroes\nDeveloping own In-game marketplace for selling, buying, and trading to get more funds for the Final Phase\n\nPhase III (Final Phase, game release) - Q4 2021\n\nCode freeze (Balancing)\nFeature complete beta version of the game\nMain game mechanics working and tested for initial release (QA)\nStart developing additional deeper game mechanics (depends on funding and sales)\n\nUse of Catalyst Funding\n\nHire further resources like coders and artists, testers\nGetting dev-kits and dev license for iOS\nLocalize in additional languages like French, Russian, Polish, or Hispanic\nCommunity manager for international groups\nDesign of deeper game mechanics\nSome Marketing would be nice :) (teaser, trailer, Facebook(ads), Google(ads), content creation like youtube and twitch)\n\nBusiness Model- Road to success\nWe like to call our business model a hybrid one. Since we started to develop the world of ADA, we also already invested time and money BUT we also started to create a community around our project, which we like to expanse to an international one.\nThe initial NFT sale will hopefully allow us to get some financial support from the community, which would flow completely into the development.\n\n \n\nThe future business model will be a hybrid of in-game sales (only cosmetics, NO pay2win) and community-based funding for upcoming add-ons and maybe some further rewards from running our stake pool successfully.\n\n \n\nBesides the initial NFTs sale, what really will help us to get through the phases is the additional \"juice\" to set up the business and run smoothly until the release. The first draft of the game is created by us, our coder, artist, and game designer are working already on Phase I of the project.

Take health care for instance: health workers, patients and health care insurance companies have to track and approve worked hours and arrange payments. The plan is to create a dapp that will allow these parties to perform their tasks as efficiently as possible in a secure and user-friendly way.\n\nThe above is only one use case. We will build a framework of time tracking and billing that will be applicable to many use cases, for instance companies that pay free-lancers for IT development work. In addition to secure time tracking and payments it will be possible for companies to put up funds in escrow accounts for payments. Funds will be released if the worker and approver sign of on the hours worked or on other agreements made. If there is no sign-off, funds are returned. This increases the likelyhood that the worker will receive his/her money. Also, because of this incentive, overall, the change of success for the deal increases.\n\nFunds that are in escrow accumulate interests (by lending out to other defi platforms). This additionial profit will be paid to the worker, or, if work is not delivered, returned to the company that put up the funds.\n\nA trusted framework will require digital identities on Cardano, tokens to register and exchange assets (hours worked) and smart contracts to execute payments and put funds in escrow accounts.\n\nThe advantages of using a decentralized network above a centralized solution are:\n\n- Transactions (hours registered, payments) are stored decentrally (at least hashes) making it more difficult to tamper with data. Blockchains have a strong auditing capability.\n\n- Using a trusted blockchain network will make it easier to convince new organizations to connect and trust existing parties that are already tracking hours or executing payments on Cardano.\n\n- Smart contracts will ensure predictable and correct payment behaviour.\n\n- Cardano tokens and smart contracts will offer a single technology that will make it easy for parties to exchange information (tokens) and execute smart contracts. Connecting parties can develop smart contracts with party-specific behavior. All this is possible in a centralized network, but the level of security, robustness and smart contract possibilities of a blockchain like Cardano are much higher.\n\n- Self-sovereign identities will allow users to only share necessary details needed for tracking time and payments.\n\n- Financial transactions will be global and fast. This will allow for truly global tracking of work hours where hours can be tracked on one continent while payments are executed by an organization on the other side of the globe without the usual delays of money transfer. Yes, all this can be achieved by connecting centralized systems, but a decentralized solution will be superior, less chance of connection components failing, more trust and all parties are using the same platform to interface with each other.\n\n- Blockchain tech offers possibilities to keep money for payments in escrow, generating extra money (staking, lending on other defi platforms).\n\nThe first phase consists of more validation with workers and organisations to verify the proposal and to design and build a prototype using the features of the existing Project Hours time tracking app. This will help designing the right processes and, very importantly, implement the requirements of our customers in the best way.\n\nWe want to achieve this in a period of three months with one person working on this full time to design and build the prototype dapp. The other team members will help designing processes and validating the idea with other organisations. Of course the team size and roles can change, this is a first proposal. The requested funds are needed to sustain one person working on this full-time for 3 months without income from other activities (will take unpaid leave from current job).\n\nAfter the first phase we will evaluate the validation results and prototype and plan next phases in detail.\n\nPresentation with a high level use case described: https://1drv.ms/p/s!Am8N2js26XiCj7g9zj-WCaBtq7ssvA?e=t19wpO\n\nTeam members:\n\nBert-Jan Lappenschaar https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjlappenschaar/\n\nRobert-Jan van Es https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertjanvanes/\n\nImre de Groot https://www.linkedin.com/in/imre-de-groot-04655529/\n\nHigh level initial road map:\n\n- 3 months: working prototype with technology selected, time tracking functionality and basic smart contracts in place\n\n- 6 months: pilot projects with customers, identity framework added, implementation of smart contracts.\n\n- 12 months: test with customers, complete minimum viable functionalities, commercial roll-out to first customers\n\nA lot of refinement needed, comments are welcome!\n\n- Find out exactly what technologies to use\n\n- More detailed business process flow\n\nThanks Marco Mirabella from the Ensuro project to think along with us!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351579-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n#Development\n\nTo simplify development, we'll be using https://www.blockfrost.io/ to communicate with the blockchain instead of building our own API layer.\n\nThe plugin will be quite simple with two interfaces:\n\nThe administrator/merchant to configure their address,\n\nFor the user to interact with the website to conduct a transaction.\n\nWhen an order is made the plugin will monitor for the value of ADA and metadata that will be sent to the address to identify a unique transaction.

In scenarios where the paper wallet is being used as a form of exchange (merchant selling paper wallets in exchange for local fiat currency), the mechanics of securely sharing a password to the buyer along with their paper wallet can quickly become complex or expensive. Having no security is a recipe for financial disaster.\n\n \n\nI am proposing a smart contract based system that will allow the merchant to validate / approve the transaction associated with the paper wallet through a simple mobile interface. In this way, if a thief were to steal any number of paper wallets from the merchant, he would have no way of completing the transaction and transferring the funds to his own wallet.\n\nProject Scope\n\nI intend to take this from proof of concept to a working application with manual interaction by the merchant in 6 months.

The Polldr party will be one of the first parties to use the Prsona dapp. We will use it to form the Polldr party and to guide the party with the representation of the people. The app will be decentralized, open source, modular build and focused on politics so that other political parties can use it too.\n_\nWhy do we need the Prsona dapp?\nThere are ways to gather data from people, but there is no application using blockchain or a DLT at this moment. I don't know (d)apps where one can build/form their own political persona and provide the info to political parties so they can represent us better. A political persona can represent you - as a voter - in a digital world. This persona consists of all your political preferences like your voting history, favorite parties, poll history and other information you have submitted or received.\n_\nHow?\nFocus on releasing an MVP in 6 months. We start by collecting simple personal data and answers to simple queries about certain political preferences or views. By asking questions, creating quizzes, conducting polls and collecting more relevant information on a regular basis, a decentralized political persona can be build over time.\nIdentity: Non-verified identities to begin with (Atala Prism?);\nPersonal data: Basic info;\nAddresses: Cardano addresses can be added/connected to an identity;\nPoll data: Overview of polls (open/close) and your answers;\nPolitical landscape: You can follow, like and dislike other political parties in the app;\nMembership: Subscribe to a political party and pay them membership fees trough a smart contract;\nAvatar: Build a digital representation of your political self:\nTokens: Payment in ADA or tokens created by political parties;\nFiat: Fiat gateway to attract non-crypto users.\n_\nYour Prsona NFT: Forming a complete political persona takes time but we want to make it a 'fun' and gamified experience. Personas can have a customizable appearance to act as an avatar. Eventually a digital representation of your political persona can be minted on a Cardano NFT. You could share and sell copies of your avatars with attributes corresponding to your political preferences, lifestyle and other relevant gadgets.\n_\nWhat can a political party do with the Prsona dapp?\nStrategy: A political party can use the personas to form and evaluate the party's point of views and their short and long term plans. A complete strategy can be build or updated using Prsona data;\nParticipation: In the Netherlands there are regular voting rounds in the 'second chamber' (House of Representatives) about a variety of subjects. With the Prsona dapp, direct participation becomes possible. Polls can be send out to the people to see how they would vote on certain matters. A political party can then choose which strategy to follow or actions to take to represent their supporters accordingly;\nMembership fees: In the Netherlands, political parties are registered in the chamber of commerce as 'associations' and membership fees form a large part of the income source. A (recurring) payment option from within the Prsona dapp could provide the ability to bring in funds via members;\nBenchmark: Eventually the goal is to open up (or copy) the dapp for other political parties in the Netherlands and also for parties around the world. Each party needs to have it's own userbase with paid / free accounts and it's own allocation of membership funds. With more parties using the app there can be benchmarking among parties.\n_\nPotential users\nParties in the Netherlands: In the Netherlands, a political party needs around 67,000 votes in the national elections to take place in the House of Representatives with 1 seat (150 seats in total). Here you can find the average members of the big political parties in the Netherlands: https://dnpp.nl/themas/leden. Polldr aims to participate in the elections of 2025 and the goal is to have 25,000 paying members by 2023.\nIf other Dutch parties would use the app the potential paying members could reach 75,000 by 2023.\nParties in the world: It is hard to say how much political parties would use or further develop the Prsona dapp. Each new party would bring in new users to the platform. Estimate > 500.000 users\nPrsona users: The goal for the Prsona dapp users (unique identities) in the Netherlands is 50.000 to 150.000 users by the end of 2022. The goal for total users of the Prsona dapp is 300.000 to 500.000 active users worldwide by the end of 2022.\n_\nGoals\n1-3 months: Complete ideation and design. Compliancy. Branding ready. Website live.\n3-6 months: Basic user profile functionality. Connect social media accounts. Basic political party registration. Political parties overview. Subscribe to, like, dislike and bookmark political parties. Subscriptions to parties payed in ADA.\n6-12 months and beyond: Advanced user profile. Manually define your own political standpoint.

Also Payment withdrawal in some platforms can take up to 2 weeks. in addition to fees of the international payment network around 2%.\nLimitation on project value from payment network.\nThe absence of milestone payments in the contract for large projects or ongoing contracts as a support engineer.\nUnfair Dispute Settlement Clients have changing requirements and freelancers have to deal with these changes. This can be very challenging for freelancers as some clients require a specific output also sometimes client need help in documenting his requirements, Besides this, the feedback system for freelancers tend to be skewed towards the client since freelancers have to make the deadlines or else they won't get paid or even worse an undeserving review will be given to them. This will ultimately have an adverse effect on their earnings, and ratings. Ratings play a big part in the freelancing market as it dictates the amount of work a freelancer can secure\nCentralized Authority: All existing freelancing websites have sole authority over the decisions of the platform. This includes the suspension of accounts without any valid reason. This results in the withholding of funds earned by the freelancer for the work he/she had delivered. Whenever this happens, trust and faith is lost.\nHow ADALancer manage all these problems? Blockchain technology has made it possible to provide solutions such as decentralized marketplace, instant payment, low fees, security of funds and feedback mechanism.\nHere are some major characteristics which make ADALancer unique from other freelancing platforms:-\nInstant Payments: smart contracts are going to be deployed that are going to act as an escrow medium with predefined conditions and rules to facilitate a smooth transaction between the client and freelancer\nDecentralized platform: We aim to introduce a decentralized autonomous organization marketplace, opened to its community as specialized token holders \"TA\" will be able to decide on a particular matter in an incentivized manner. This leads to a more transparent and trustless system without having a third party making the decisions\nDispute Resolution: Conflict resolution is carried out using smart contracts that ensures neither party get any payment problems or undeserved reviews. If either party is unsatisfied, an independent panel of TA will deliver a verdict on the matter while being rewarded for their participation.\nLow Fees: We aim to charge only 3% of the contract price. It is considered a low fee due to eliminating the middleman cost.\nActors\nClient\nIs a business owner could be a person or an established company looking to find the best matching freelancer or software provider with specialized skill to provide the required software project or IT operation service with good quality and effective cost under certain SLA .\nThe client project scope should be one of the below:\n\nFreeLancers\nITA \"if the client project is big and client is not interested in managing a group of freelancers.\"\n\nThe client project type could be one of the below\n\nSoftware Development\nSupport Service\nAdvisory consultant\nThe project details business & technical requirements should be filled by Client\nin the RFP section as the platform recommends certain information for freelancers to understand the client requirements.\nThen the client is expecting to receive proposals from freelancers or IT Agencies.\nFreeLancer is someone who has a certain skills and reputation is responsible for sending proposals to clients to sell work or service. might be registered under an IT agency.\nIT Agency (ITA) is a virtual IT company \"group of freelancers\" could be managed on the platform and looking for finding potential clients they have:\n\n\na reference projects and clients\nset of IT skills\nTeam structure ,CVS ,skills and IT certificates\nAdvisory Team \"AT\"\nIs a group of IT people classified by skills, responsible for managing the disputes between clients and freelancers/ITA, they are capable of rating the freelancers & ITA skills, Conducting technical interviews where the freelancer stares back at a tribunal of assessors under a barrage of rapid-fire questions .They are receiving rewards for their works from the platform. they are required to hold a certain amount of ADAlancer token.If the token holders are not IT experts they will delegate the IT experts to do the technical work on their behalf.\nHow does the Platform work?\n\n\nClient will apply for a new project requirement through the platform.\nClient will select the project type and scope (freelancer or ITA)\nClient will fill payment terms and conditions and submit the RFP document.\nPlatform will notify matched freelancers/ITA to check the RFP as they are eligible for sending a proposal.\nFreelancers/ITA could ask the platform for proving their skills by assigning random ATs to validate and rating their skills and experience.\nFreelancers/ITA will review RFP and they can contact the client to ask for more information.\nFreelancers/ITA will submit their proposal to client.\nClient will select the appropriate freelancer/ITA.\nOnce the freelancer submits the project and client is accepted the smart-contract will transfer the money from client wallet to freelancer.\nIf the client doesn't agree with freelancer/ITA. will ask to dispute the issue and the platform will assign it to the court team.\nThe platform will call the appropriate TAs for voting by sending an email .\nOnce the voting process has been finished and the decision is finalized the money will move based on the voting decision and the case will be closed.\nThe platform will ask the client to submit a review and comment on freelancer work quality.\nPlatform Components\n\n\nClient & FreeLancer/ITA Profile\nDecentralized reputation verification to verify & rate the freelancers\nTendering module\nVoting module.\nTendering/project/service event and notification management\nProject delivery/quality module\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351200-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis project was submitted in Fund3 but missed out on funding by $1000. We have streamlined the proposal in order to make the use of funds more effective and also to address concerns from Fund3.\nOverview\nThe platform aims to be a next-generation crowdfunding platform based on the Cardano network. By using the Cardano network the platform can enjoy low fees, fast transactions and a great community whilst increasing network usage and encouraging adoption.\nMainstream crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and GoFundMe have been hugely successful in recent years, however both require a huge amount of trust from investors that their money is going to be used as they expect, and that they will receive the expected reward or benefit associated with the fundraising campaign. This platform aims to reduce the level of trust required by investors through the use of smart contracts as will be explained further in the proposal.\nGoals\nInvestor Insurance:\nAs previously mentioned, the main goal of this platform is to provide a trustworthy, secure way for backers to invest in chosen projects.\nLow fees:\n\nInvestors need to be sure that no matter what time of day or how busy the network is, they are not paying extortionate fees when backing a project. This is why the Cardano network is the ideal solution for this platform.\n\nBusiness Launchpad:\nThe platform will aim to be the ideal launchpad for businesses and ideas both big and small. Thanks to the scalability of the Cardano blockchain, the platform can enable campaigns from as little as a few hundred ADA to hundreds of thousands of ADA.\nInvestor Insurance\nIn order to prevent scams where a product is promised and never delivered, the platform will introduce a staged funding model. In this model campaigns will receive only a small percentage of the campaign funding initially in order to get the project off the ground. The staged funding model is explained in a step-by-step process below;\n\nProject owner launches their campaign with a desired target amount and a specified initial payout amount.\nBackers research the campaign and assess whether they think the project has potential and whether they would like to back the project.\nIf once the campaign deadline passes the project has been successfully funded (i.e. amount raised is greater than the goal) then the initial funding is released to the project owner. If the target amount is not reached then all backers receive a refund of their investment.\nOnce the project owner has reached a milestone in their project and would like to receive the next stage of funding, they can request an amount from the funding pool. This starts a vote in which backers vote on whether they think the milestone has been completed successfully and if the requested amount is acceptable.\nIf this vote passes, the next stage of funding is released to the project owner. If the vote does not pass then backers have the opportunity to wait for more evidence of the milestone being completed or they can start a refund vote. If the refund vote passes with a specific quorum then all backers remaining contributions are refunded.\n\n \n\nProject Scope\nThis project does not aim to create the perfect crowdfunding platform from day one, it aims to use the funding from this proposal to create the first usable version of the platform before growing over time to fix any issues the community has or implement any improvements. In this section I will outline the scope of what will be completed using funds from this proposal.\n\nDevelopment, testing and auditing of smart contracts required for the project.\n\nDesign and implementation of a front-end website\nEnsure a legal framework is in place to protect backers and fundraisers alike and ensure that the platform is operating within the law in various countries.\n\n \n\nFuture Plans and Sustainability\nIn the future the platform will be sustained via small fees (~2%) applied to fundraising campaigns (far less than platforms such as Kickstarter which takes 5%) and will not be applied if a project fails to raise enough funds or to any investments refunded to backers. These fees will be made clear on the platform so that campaigns can accommodate for these when fundraising. These fees will help to pay for web hosting and platform management.\n\nFuture plans include the following;\nAllow payments in fiat.\nAllow payments in other cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins.\n\nGovernance\nAfter launch, changes to the crowdano platform will be governed by governance tokens. These tokens will allow users to vote for or against proposed changes in the platform. Initially these tokens will be distributed to delegators of the Crowdano Crowdfunding stake pool, however it will eventually be possible to earn tokens by launching products using Crowdano, or even donating to projects.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Property\nI believe that in order to promote community involvement as well as improve security that the smart contracts needed for the project should be open source. As such I will be releasing the contracts on github for anyone to view.\n\n \n\nProject Costs\n\nSmart Contract Audit - $5,000\nWebsite Development - $10,000\nWeb hosting and domain - $1,000\nMarketing - $10,000\nLegal council - $5,000\n\nWage - $0 - In order to ensure the platform's success, I will divert all funds for my wages into other aspects of the project since I am a firm believer in this project.\nTotal - $31,000\nTo allow for any delays or unforseen expenses, a safety cushion of $2000 will be added to the requested amount, bringing the total up to $33,000.\n\n \n\nRelevant Experience\nI have over 7 years of experience in software development with knowledge of various programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, Solidity, HTML, PHP and SQL.\nI am also a member of the Plutus Pioneer programme, giving me early access to the Plutus testnet which will allow for testing the smart contracts before launch.\nWith these skills it is possible for me to design the website and program the smart contracts needed for this platform.\n\n \n\nKey Performance Indicators and Roadmap\nThe platform aims to be completed within 6 months, however it may be possible to complete the project due before smart contracts are launched on the mainnet in June/July 2021. As a member of the Plutus Pioneer programme, I will have access to an early testnet, allowing me to test the contracts extensively before launch.\n\nWebsite: Partially completed, full functionality expected early June 2021\nSmart Contracts: Started. Expected finish June 2021\nTesting: June/July 2021\nLaunch: July 2021 earliest, November 2021 latest.\n\nOnce deployed, the platform aims to have at least 50 campaigns active in the first 6 months with this number growing rapidly into the future. This will be achieved through the use of a marketing firm to ensure our platform reaches as many potential users as possible.\n\n \n\nFeedback\nIf you have any feedback regarding this proposal or the project in general, please do not hesitate to ask or suggest anything. I am always open to feedback!\n\n \n\nWhitepaper\n\nV0.1 of the whitepaper can be found attached to this proposal.\n\n \n\nReferences\n[1] https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/329995\n[2] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2088298&http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2088298","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351183-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nBackground\nThe reason I have put forward this idea for fund 5 is that I have a tokenization of a physical asset use case. This seeks to crowd-fund and tokenize ownership of a football club (around 5th-6th tier in the English football pyramid - that's soccer for you US folk) which is also backed by ADA in a smart contract to have a more sustainable business model. (See use case slides attached below to show my concept)\n\nI am seeking Cardano developers to collaborate with for this project who can help write up the designs / schema for the native token physical asset standard. Quite a lot of funding proposals in Catalyst are looking at physical tokenization e.g. property - but no one is actively looking at the Cardano standard for physical tokenization to make sure we have consistency. If we are not careful, when smart contracts arrive the community's enthusiasm will lead to extremely messy code that has security flaws as everyone tries to 'reinvent the wheel'.\n\nThis proposal has gone into the dApps and Integration challenge because that is how I see my future use case with the football club token but I want to start small and almost do a POC. I can totally understand why this challenge might instead be a better fit in the Metadata or Developer Ecosystem challenges and it isn't exactly clear to me which challenge this should be submitted to. I welcome any advice from the community on this topic.\n\nScope\nThe scope for this fund is to:\n- Create a native token standard for tokenized physical assets (1 example use case: football club of type business)\n- Review and approve schema with community stakeholders (other funding projects may be able to take advantage of this schema/framework)\n- Create documentation for the community, that explains in simple English what we have done, and how this type of native token will work from an architecture perspective. (This will help drive innovation and bring in new developers to our eco-system)\n\nI am not able to do this on my own so the budget I'm seeking, looks to cover my own expenses + the expenses of developers that I find. I plan to project manage this project from start to end. (See my website Steerco to show my Project Management and Agile credentials).\n\nThe current funding request of $10k is an estimate - I hope to finalise and confirm the budget required as I find developers to work with throughout the Fund 5 proposal round.\n\nProject Plan\n\nHire: 1 x architect / developer, 1 x security architect (need a 2nd pair of eyes at a minimum - but hope that more people contribute from the community)\nCommunication to community - make sure we gather feedback from other projects / stakeholders to gather their requirements\nCreate the native token schema in an agile iterative manner (Create draft schema for review, Peer review with all project stakeholders, Update schema based on feedback)\nSubmit schema to Github for merge to cardano-foundation:master branch under CIP\nCreate community documentation (e.g. animated videos, website, blog posts)\n\nI see the project plan taking about 3 months to complete from the point in which resources are hired. It will not be full time roles and I have planned currently for 3 iterations of feedback. I plan to run this project in 2 week sprints.\n\nMetrics of Success\n\nCollaboration with multiple stakeholders in the Cardano eco-system\nAdoption of native token physical assets standard (developers, dApps or DAO over the next 12-24 months)\nWider adoption for Cardano - tokenizing physical assets is something being explored on other chains (see Binance and Tesla stock recently)\nUse this schema to crowd-fund the tokenization and ownership of a football club onto the Blockchain\nAgile design and development metrics can be communicated to the community to be transparent on progress\n\n \n\nFuture Roadmap\nI plan to use this schema that is developed for a use case that I mentioned above (see attached slides) to crowd-fund and tokenize ownership of a football team on Cardano. This is out of scope for this funding challenge but hopefully gives you an insight into why I am looking at this funding challenge. Tokenizing a football club on Cardano is going to be very difficult therefore I am aiming to start simple, with a view to develop this idea and deliver it over the next 18-24 months. (I already have found private investors who are interested in running this project, but I would prefer to crowd-fund and do this as a community which aligns much more with the Cardano ethos)\n\n \n\nAt this stage I would propose circa 5m in crowdfunding to make this happen - as I would target a smaller professional team in the English league pyramid (around 6th tier). The aim is over the next 10 years to use the ADA/Football token model to create a sustainable football club (staking ADA and splitting rewards 50/50 between club & shareholder), that has fan ownership, and owning the token gives you 'voting rights' regarding manager changes, budgets, signings. (Think real world football manager meets Catalyst voting for those who hold the Football token).\n\n \n\nThis would be the first truly 'digital football club' and being the first to do this would bring significant opportunities with other revenue streams.

A number of projects have undergone initial development which promise the evolution of a vibrant ecosystem. Of particular interest today are decentralized and centralized finance solutions.\nFor example, the liqwid token (LQ) intends to provide extraordinary products in the domain of decentralized lending. Celsius (CEL) has expressed interest in becoming a multi chain product with a Cardano deployment as a centralized lending product. A Uniswap clone was demoed during the latest Cardano 360 update.\nCardano is committed to interchain operability and integration. Nonetheless, that interoperability is unavailable for many assets. We see opportunity in providing wrapped versions of assets not currently available to users on Cardano. We argue these wrapped assets will complement the financial solutions described above. Further, we argue these wrapped assets provide superior user experiences than those found in their native environments.\nWe intend to deploy wrapped versions of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Uniswap (UNI), and Polkadot (DOT) to the Cardano blockchain during our first year of operation. We will follow up with the expansion of our catalog into other popular assets, including physical assets.\nWhitepaper:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHjkrEdgoGS8KHoGk3XfLo3Xut5lCThkOxEs1Z7ekS0/edit?usp=sharing\nCost breakdown:\n1 year burn rate of $485k\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kx-xLiPzkippsZelaJ5D7rYT7mLb_kFm4rqBX5y-cYU/edit?usp=sharing\nWe are seeking 4 months of runway. $150,000\nBranding and Positioning:'The Coinbase of Asset Wrapping'\nWe seek to provide asset wrapping to the broader population, to professional entities such as lenders and exchanges, and to early adopter crypto currency enthusiasts.\nTeam:\n1.

It takes a lot of time and paperwork.\n\nElevator pitch\n\nInteract with strangers on the blockchain and exchange value and services with minimal risk by participating in a network of trust that anyone can verify.\n\nSolution to the problem\n\nI believe that soon people will want to represent real-world properties as equity tokens. Those properties will be tradable and have many fractional owners. There will be a need for trusted property managers responsible for maintenance, recurring payments of dividends etc. Today there is no way to build human trust on blockchain thus there is no one to manage those real-word properties and there is no infrastructure which could facilitate this kind of marketplace either.\nSmart contracts designed in line with a new standard would provide verifiable past performance and provide a way to earn reputation and trust.\n\nDetailed plan\n\nThere is a need for a standard way of assigning some trust score to entities like property managers on the Cardano blockchain. This is how it could work:\nListing entity (company that legally and outright owns some property) sells shares of a property by minting equity tokens and offers them at the market at the price they want to it sell for. Along with tokens, property's master wallet is created.\nMaster wallet (governed by smart contract) receives all income generated by property to later distribute it fairly. Master wallet is responsible for minting and burning trust tokens.\nInvestors (wallets that own equity tokens) using their private keys will:\n- vote on various decisions,\n- approve or disapprove property manager's actions,\n- receive their share of profit generated by the property.\nProperty manager (person or a company represented by identity token) maintains property and takes a fee for doing it. If investors are happy, property manager will be allowed to burn trust tokens they receive periodically together with money to cover agreed upon property expenses. This process will increase their trust score in the network. Not burning trust tokens will decrease their trust score.\nIf multiple dapps developers would implement standard way of recognizing and assigning new trust score it would incentivise people who need to be trusted to invest in their credibility, because it would not be tight to a single application or company but it would be for ever recognizable by anybody with access to internet thus creating a network effect.\nYou are property owner and need trustworthy manager → you ask potential managers to send a signed message with a proof that they successfully manage or used to manage such and such wallets.\nYou are an property manager and looking for customers → you make sure your potential customer is on Cardano blockchain. Only this way you will work for money and provable trustworthiness which will accumulate accumulate over time and bring you more business.\n\nExample\n\nImagine a real-word investment property like old-school vending machine (but really could be anything physical). There are couple of problems with it:\n1. It is expensive.\n2. It needs space, it can break.\n3. Income will not be in digital currency (you need to trust somebody to convert it to crypto).\nSo what happens if we tokenize it? First of all, we can crowdfund the purchase, so the first point is out. But there is no way to solve the other two problems without a real human manager which exists on the blockchain. We need somebody to fix it when it breaks (which means they must have access to some money to which owners also have a right), and because it is an investment we need a way to receive dividend and prove its performance to the next investor when its time for us to sell our share (good dividend will likely increase price of the property).\nAlong the way there will be decisions to make, like for example: do we want to sell Coca-cola or Pepsi? Do we want to change location of our machine from expensive shopping center to cheaper collage campus or not? Good property manager will execute on those decisions and should be awarded with universal trust score which will be accepted by others (but not transferable to others). I believe this is all possible to implement on Cardano blockchain.\n\nPlan\n\nMy plan is to:\n1. In 4 weeks develop set of smart contracts in Plutus that will serve as a proof-of-concept for this imaginary scenario. This will include contracts driving: master wallet, decision voting and manager approval or disapproval.\n2. In one week create a website with basic introduction to the standard and explain purpose it serves to attract developers that don't have yet experience with Plutus.\n3. In one week create a technical documentation for how similar contracts must be created in order to have compatibility between them.\nI estimate it will take me up to 6 weeks learning and working full-time to complete. Requested funds will cover:\n* $500 website design\n* $7500 my compensation as Plutus developer.\n\nChallenge question: What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2021?\n\nMy new standard will introduce new currency to the crypto economy which is human trust. It will be measured in actual dollars spend on things that were promised they were going to be spend on. If successful, it will have a huge impact on what developers will be able to build on Cardano blockchain when utilizing this new standard. You will be able to implement things like: insurance, arbitration, more transparent ICOs, peer-to-peer lending, property management (as explained in detail) and many more areas of life where trust and reputation are essential.\n\nChallenge metrics impact\n\nIt might take longer time but potential for impact is massive. Trust is something that does not exist today on blockchain. In fact trust-less nature of blockchain is what attracts a lot of people to the crypto space, but I believe that if we introduce trust back to the blockchain it will only broaden its appeal and provide completely new possibilities.\n\nDefinition of success\n\n* In 3 months I will be able create my own dapp following this standard.\n* In 6 months at least one other developer will create dapp based on this standard.\n* In 12 months people will invest time and money to gain trust and reputation on the network.\n\nNext steps\n\nIf successful, my next step would be to create a blockchain explorer website where instead of all transactions I would focus only on transactions related to smart contracts adhering to my standard. That would include all actions related to: decision making, approvals, ownership changes, payments etc. Based on all those inputs I will also be able to calculate trust score for property managers.\n\nComparison with other ideas\n\nNative tokens for physical assets (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Native-tokens-for-physical-assets/351135-48088) - focuses on distinguishing tokens with metadata but lacks solution for interactions with those tokens (like voting and delegating entities responsible for managing assets). If there is a standard way of representing physical tokens I'll definitely take advantage of this but my plan is to do so much more then that.\nDecentralized real estate (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Decentralized-real-estate/351225-48088) - my idea is not to have single marketplace for curated assets, but to create a standard that will allow co-existance of many different markets (and to create so called ecosystem). They just need to agree that they respect trust score that was created on any of the other platforms and implement smart contracts following common standard so people can earn trust using their service.\nAn authentic review ecosystem (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/An-authentic-review-ecosystem/352771-48088) - I believe that it is possible to have trust without KYC identity verification. Trust is earned by executing on shareholders decisions and not by showing some papers.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350886-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350809-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350808-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nOVERVIEW\nWe'll build mobile and browser apps that will allow users to save their logins encrypted on the cardano blockchain using transaction metadata. Passwords and sensitive information are never lost, no central server required and no recurring fees.\n \nThe idea is to bring regular users to the cardano blockchain without them even knowing they are using it. On the surface the app will be a regular password manager, with the option to buy credit (with credit card) for saving information to the blockchain. There will be a \"bait\" to attract new people into cardano in the app through the option to load credit using ADA as well (cheaper than buying credit the regular way). Our goal to showcase what can be built on top of this technology, bring more utility to the general user who doesn't even know what crpto is, and hopefully educate and incentivize people to join our ecosystem.\n \nVALUE PROPOSITION\nWe propose a DApp that runs as browser extensions and mobile apps, and allows users to automatically generate secure passwords for any websites they are visiting, then save any logins & passwords, bookmarks or other information that must remain secure (such as account recovery codes). Auto-completion of details such as credit card information and personal addresses, etc\nHow it will work:\nUsers will install the extension or app and be presented with two options for setting the password manager on the new device:\n(1) New Secret Profile\n\nthis will present the user with a seed phrase like a regular wallet, the profile name (optional), and a master password for the secret profile.\nthe encryption algorithm to be used to encrypt user data locally and on the blockchain. AES will be the default.\n(2) Restore Secret Profile\nthe user will be asked for the seed phrase of an existing profile, and the master password for it.\nIf you provide a seed phrase from one of your existing cardano wallets, it will work fine. That could include wallets managed by hardware devices such as ledger/trezor\nthe profile name will be loaded automatically from the corresponding wallet metadata - if empty then the user will be asked to provide a name\nMultiple profiles can be created, such as \"my logins\", \"credit cards\" and \"work\". Whenever some secret information is saved, it will be stored locally and associated with a given profile. Everything encrypted using the private key that's protected by the master password. You can optionally provide a master password for each profile.\nWhen websites are visited and a password field is detected, the extension will offer to fill the password if it's been registered. At that time, the user will be asked for the master password to decrypt the details and fill in the form on screen.\nIf it's an unknown password, DaPassword will allow you to input the password or simply generate one for you. The password generation process can be configurable similarly to what commercial products like LastPass offer (select password length, allowed characters, etc).\nEverything works locally and anonymously. Your details will be stored on the blockchain whenever you choose to do it. If you have many logins and other details to import on an initial setup, all of them can be persisted locally first, then with a single transaction saved on the blockchain, substantially reducing your costs.\nUser who have no idea what cardano is and what a blockchain is, won't have to learn it. When attempting to save their credentials, they'll be offered the option to \"buy credit\", which will essentially load ADA in their app under the hood to enable transactions to take place to persist their data. ADA holders will be able to simply transfer their ADA to a receiving address exposed by the application with no additional cost.\nAs everything will be stored on the blockchain, users can restore their secret profiles in multiple devices and all their updates will be picked up automatically from the blockchain, including the \"available credit\" to persist new logins and secret information.

This includes any organization that helps protect, rescue or a sanctuary for all forms of animal, from Elephants to Pangolins, Horses, Cows to Cats and Dogs etc.\nSupporter - A user who is staking their wallet address(s) to the system\nAmbassador - A person who lives in the country/state/area who is able to have face to face contact with the conservation organizations for verification, validation and help them out with receiving the funds of Ada.\n\nSummary\n\nCreate a DApp to allow Supporters the ability to stake their Ada (or portion of) to a staking pool via a smart contract that will distribute the rewards to Protectors based on their votes (web3 wallet integration will be required). In the future we could send to rescue farms and individuals that specifically help rescue animals all over the globe.\n\nThis will essentially be a staking rewards distribution system via a Smart Contract Core that will be able to be reused by other Cardano Developers.\n\nWe want to give the Supporters something great in return for helping fund the Protectors.\nAlthough the main reason people stake is to get the Ada rewards, it may end up being a more valuable reward to receive a unique NFTs instead. This will make a lot more sense when staking supports partial wallet amounts. We would hope that a lot of small amounts will add up to something bigger.\nThe Supporters will in return receive a unique NFT specific to their contributions (depending on how often the rewards are distributed). This could be a unique photo of an animal saved that month, a piece of artwork or whatever can be thought of. There will also be a unique NFT given out every so often randomly.\n\n \n\nWe will divide this into 2 parts:\n\n \n\nPart 1: This will work like the subscription box service with different levels giving different types of NFT. The level they are in will be based on the fiat value at the time the rewards come through from the stake pool(s) (probably USD). This is so we can account for the fluctuating value of Ada. As a side effect, Supporters will automatically move around the levels as prices change. The level thresholds may change over time as the value changes. Example only (not final levels).\nIf 1 Ada = $1 USD and their staking rewards returns 100 Ada that is the $100 subscription level\nIf 1 Ada = $2 USD then their staking rewards may put them into the $200 subscription level\n\n \n\nPart 2: Supporters can make a direct donation to their Protector of choice and then they will receive an NFT along the lines of SpaceBudz where it is randomly generated. The rarity may be based on the amount donated. The treasury will get a small portion of this.\n\n \n\nI would like these to not just be a NFT which seems to be the thing right now - I want the NFTs to have more real value than just a digital asset. As these Supporters are essentially committing real money they obviously have some connection with the helping of animals. We would like to be able to in conjunction with Protectors offer either safari's or animal interactions at zoos.\nThis is something that your average person would have to pay for or not even be able to get, but the NFT holders get something special. Think of the NFTs as a form of animal passport within the community.\nWe will also provide updates and feedback on where their rewards helped. This will be done via the Protectors and/or Ambassadors data and shown on our website.\nThere would be a community where people can suggest conservation organizations, NFT rewards etc.\nAs much of this is on chain as possible, but to start with some of it may need to be off-chain.\n\nStaking Rewards Distribution System via a Smart Contract (open source)\n\nThe plan would be to develop this in such a way where the core underlying code (smart contract) can be used by anyone (open source) who would like to be able to send to a stakepool, manage where to send it and then get the rewards distributed to relevant addresses. Developers could essentially come up with their own plan/dapp that sits on top of this smart contract. This is still being architected - subject to change.\n\n \n\nThe Supporter will allocate their stake via the DApp (we will support Protector voting in a future version). They will only need to do this once. Hopefully just a simple api call via JS to either our servers or a Cardano smart contract server with their staking information (after permission given from the web wallet of course) - not sure how it works. I hope I'm using oracles in the correct sense.\nPlease see attached DApp / Smart Contract Image\n\nSmart Contract (User Delegated):\n\nThis will tell the smart contract that this Supporter is now part of Project Kifaru and their delegation can be routed (and re-routed on demand) to the stake pools of our choice. All rewards from those pools will be returned to our treasury wallet and not the Supporters wallet.\n\nSmart Contract (6 Epoch Triggered - Distribute - the core):\n\nEvery 6 Epochs (~ 1 month), the rewards will be collected from the pools and placed in our treasury (all this will be publicly visible and on-chain).\n\nGive us the required rewards to sustain us (for a given amount of time). The time is to allow for leaner reward return and lower Cardano prices. This is for operating costs and paying artists.\nCalculate the reward distribution to the Protectors and send to their wallets (all public of course).\nGive us a list of Supporter reward contributions.\nTrigger a stakepool re-delegation if some are saturating or our needs change and we start allocating to MDPs (see below). This will be fully in our control.\n\n \n\nSmart Contract (Event - Reallocate Pools):\n\nThis will re-delegate all the wallets we have across the stake pools of our choosing. There will be no need for the original wallet holder to do anything - totally smart contract driven. Note sure if this is just part of the above contract, but it might be.\n\nNFT Rewards\n\nNote that the NFT rewards to the Supporters is outside of these smart contracts and is triggered manually by us after we mint and define the allocation of the NFTs for the month. The allocations will be based on the rewards we received from the individual delegations.\n\nTeam Members – Partner with Other Catalyst Community Projects\n\nI would like to get developers and designers from within the community who have a passion for what we are doing on both the development and animal side. I have about 40 years of development experience, but I would like to take a more management role for this project.\n\nOverall Manager - Taking my development experience with many projects over the years to get the right people in place and keep the direction on track.\nDeveloper(s) – Writing the DApp and blockchain integrations - We are currently in talks with other organizations and developers who may be able to help implement this if all goes well.\nDesigner(s) – Design and brainstorm the NFTs - this will be artists, 3d artists and photographers. Not required at this stage if we go for Option 1 (see Funding)\nAmbassador(s) - People on the ground to gather, validate, help integrate and communicate with the Protectors and come up with ways to get more interactive events for the NFT holders. We do not need these people until we have an up and running system.\nOther Catalyst Community Members - we would love to access / integrate with other community projects and members wherever possible.\n\n \n\nMy Detail\n\nI have 30-40 years of past development experience working mainly in New Zealand, but also working for companies in the UK like BP (via Schlumberger), BT Syncordia and others - CV available on request. Currently transitioning to a more architecture / management role. Discord: Braden [SteampunkCow]#0277\n\nInfluencers / Marketing\n\nWe will need the help of Cardano social media influencers and the community at large to help push this to early adopters for beta testing.\nI would hope that we could use the influence of some stakepool operators with popular YouTube channels and in return we can commit some of the staking to their pool(s).\n\nMetrics (Auditability)\n\nNumber of wallets subscribed to stakepools.\nAda Rewards collected.\nPercentage / Dollars going to Protectors.\nNumber of conservation organizations.\nAnimals saved (not sure if we can actually track this)\nForests saved (not sure if we can actually track this)\nDollar value based on rewards in USD.\nFeedback from the Protectors might help show that the donations are actually making a difference.\nNumber of people subscribed to the notification mailing list.\nNumber of people following our social media.\nAda amount subscribed to stakepools.\n\n \n\nPlease view the attached PDF for a expanded version with funding options, roadmap and project components included The requested funds is for Option 1, which will cover Option 2 if Option 1 can't be done immediately.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350674-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis proposal is an updated proposal from Fund 4 - several responses to questions raised by the community advisors during fund 4 review are included at the bottom of this submission. #thankyouADAcommunity\n---\n\"From data abuse to personal data control and direct compensation\" – implementing and developing on top of the Cardano blockchain a smart contract system that (i) gives people back control over their personal information and (2) compensates them for the use of their data and for their attention.\n\nCardano adoption and impact in the next 6 months - We are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected in 2021; 78.200 expected in 2022. More info under the detailed plan, section 5. Proof of concepts (POCs) to develop under this project submission can be tested with these consumers.\n\nShort summary of the Profila app (as testing ground for the smart contract POCs) - Profila is a platform (consisting of both a mobile IOS and Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call \"Brands\") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance. Organizations can be either private or public entities.\n\nConsumers can manage their digital life in one location. They can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see \"Illustration 1 – Profila for Consumers\" attached to this proposal).\n\nNow let's move on to our actual proposal (!):\n\n1. The market explained - the current privacy problem en digital marketing business model\nToday's online advertisement model - A big part of the time we spend online (social media and websites), we are being subjected to online advertisement. The advertisement market touches billion of consumers and poses great privacy concerns.\nOnline advertisement is a lucrative business model, valued at USD 304 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 982.82 billion by 2025. This model is entirely based on collecting as much personal data about you and increasing your screen-time. Every second and click (literally) counts. What is being bought and sold by brands, ad agencies and social media companies is your attention, at a cost-per-view (CPM, per 1000 views) or cost-per-click (CPC) rate (namely each time you click an ad). For example; Facebook's average CPC is USD 1.72 worldwide; and each user clicks on avg. on 12 ads per month. In USA/Canada, Facebook's has an avg. revenue per user around USD 200/year.\n\nOnline advertisement's privacy problem - In order to present you with the best add at the right time, social media or ad companies need to sell your attention to the highest bidding business/organisation (we call them \"Brands\"). They therefore collect a large amount of personal data about you, in order to present Brands with the best possible picture of who you are and what you like. Some of this data is collected directly from you, whereas other information is collected via cookies or other third parties. Most people are not aware of how much data is shared with how many Brands, and how they use it.\n\nThe larger privacy problem – you don't know your rights or what you agree to. The same privacy problem in online advertising can be found in your direct relationship with Brands. People interact with digital services and purchase products from Brands globally. With each interaction - regulated by such a privacy policy – you directly share personal data which is used for a certain purpose (e.g. offering you a product and servicing you as a customer). You agree to share your personal data – in most cases – without knowing how a Brand will use it.\n\nIn principle, each time your personal data is collected or used by a brand, you are shown a privacy policy or cookie policy you are forced to accept. Thereby, you agree to share your personal data, without knowing how recipients will use it. These legal documents make it almost impossible to understand.\n\nBut what can you do if Brands uses your data against your expectations, and how do you keep track of all these legal terms that governs Brands' use of your personal data? You made an online Wholefoods-account to order groceries but you now get 15 newsletters/week, and your social media feed is full of adds from companies like Trader Joe's, to who you never shared your personal data. You have no idea what you agreed to in a privacy policy with Wholefoods, and you do not know why similar companies are contacting you for products you bought from Wholefoods.\n\nToday, you have no control over the use of your personal data. However, people demand more control over their personal data and are willing to take action to gain back ownership of their digital lives, but the resources to put that in motion are lacking.\n\nThat is where Profila steps in!\n\n2. Profila today - the existing consumer App – first step towards data control and compensation\n\n\"We must work together with web companies to strike a balance that puts a fair level of data control back in the hands of people, including the development of new technology … and exploring alternative revenue models like subscriptions and micropayments\" (Tim Berners-Lee, developer of the worldwide web @ CERN).\n\nIf you know how to control your data and take action against those who (mis)use it, you can demand the value that is derived from it by asking compensation.\n\nThe current Profila App helps people control their data (see 2.1 \"data control through privacy rights education and management\") and demand compensation for the use of their data (see 2.2 \"subscriptions and micropayments\".)\n\n2.1 Data Control through Privacy Rights education and Privacy Rights Management\n\nA first step to data control is knowing your rights in relation to your data and taking action against those who misuse your data.\n\nNumerous national and regional privacy and consumer protection laws (e.g. European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA); the Brazilian General Data Protection Regulation (LGDP) and many more) grants private individuals – often called \"data subjects\" – with certain rights in relation to their personal data, that can help you control/manage your data and hold Brands accountable. These rights are often called \"data subject rights\" or \"data rights\" and include e.g. the right to information; the right to opt-out, the right to access; the right to be forgotten. The main goal of these rights it to GIVE CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONAL DATA.\n\nHowever, in order to take control, you need to (1) understand your privacy rights (step 1 \"education\"), and (2) understand how to manage these rights (step 2 \"management\"). The existing Profila mobile App therefore includes a privacy education and data rights management functionality:\n\nEducation – the App has 9 basic modules about your privacy rights, explaining to you in understandable terms and with examples \"what is personal data\", \"what is a controller/processor\", \"what are your rights\", what is e.g. \"your right to be forgotten\" (see \"Illustration 2 – Profila Privacy App\" attached to this proposal).\n\nRights Management – the App then has a dashboard which allows you to manage your rights, e.g. use your \"right to object\" to tell Wholefoods to stop sending daily emails, or your \"right to be forgotten\" to ask Wholefoods to erase all personal data they hold about you. Profila has reduced this legally difficult process of exercising data subject rights to an easy 3-click step process, where you can (1) choose a company logo (recipient of the right); (2) click on one of the 8 data subject rights, and (3) include an identifier (email; phone). Profila then forwards an official legal template to the business. According to the law that applies to your relationship with this company (which is determined based on your country of residence/nationality), the company will be legally required to respond to you within 15-30 days.\n\n2.2 Subscriptions and Micropayments\n\nA second step in order to get to data control, is keeping track of your personal data. Where does your personal data reside and who has access to it? This is taken care of by Profila's data subscriptions.\n\nProfila's data subscription contract functionality allows for people to keep track of all the Brands that access and collect your personal data; and ultimately receive a compensation from Brands that subscribe to your data.\n\nVia Profila's web-based Brand dashboard, a Brand can send a \"subscription offer\" to their existing customers or potential new customers, in which the Brand can detail which of your personal information in your Profila App (one source of truth with your contact details, communication-, product preferences) they ask access to, and in which they propose to you some key contractual terms in relation to your interaction; a.o. (1) the specific data they require, (2) the duration you grant access; (3) the purpose for which the Brand wants to use it; and (4) the compensation you receive in exchange. Our process makes sure the Brand explains the contract terms in understandable language, so the consumer knows what he/she agrees to. Our revenue model is 50/50, meaning that every USD that a Brand pays for accessing your personal data (and showing you its products/services), we share 50/50 with consumers.\n\n(Please see the illustration \"Smart contract visual\" for the UX shown to the consumer during the subscription process).\nIf you do not agree to these terms, you remain anonymous and the Brand will never see your personal data. If you do agree to these terms, you essentially click \"accept\" and both parties conclude a data subscription contract. Payment is made by the brand at intervals throughout the contract terms (usually monthly), on the conditions that the consumers' personal data is kept up to data, and the brand can also access additional data about the consumer's preferences for certain products and services relevant for the brand.\n\nE.g. Wholefoods pays Alice 12 USD/year (1 USD each month) to access her (i) personal data (email, phone) (ii) preferences about food (vegetarian, bio-products, lactose intolerant) and (iii) communication preferences (Alice would like to receive discounts/product info via WhatsApp). This helps to serve her better. If Wholefoods listens to Alice, she will be a happy consumer. Alice gets good products and services and receives a compensation for the use of her personal data by Wholefoods. Each advertisement she watches, Alice gets paid. If Alice wants to know in the future what she agreed to, she can easily verify the terms of her relationship with Wholefoods in her Profila App (under the Wholefoods data subscription). If Alice want's the relationship to stop, she can end the contract and exercise her \"right to be forgotten\", so that Wholefoods is legally required to delete her personal data.\n\n3. Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - implementing privacy right transactions and data subscription contracts on the Cardano blockchain in the form of a smart contract, and using ADA for micropayments\n\nWhat do we seek to improve via this Challenge?\n\nIssue 1 - \"centralized privacy rights' and contract management\" - Each privacy right that an individual Profila user sends to a Brand today; as well as each data subscription contract (including the specific terms) that is concluded between an individual Profila user and a Brand today, is only saved/stored by Profila in our IT environment and can only be enforced by Profila or its existence proven by Profila. Profila as a commercial entity is therefore guaranteeing that a privacy right was exercises, or that a data subscription contract exists, what terms it contains, whether terms are abided by (e.g. payments made or request received).\n\nFor the privacy rights, Profila needs to monitor if the Brand received the data subject right request and if the Brand – timely – responded to the individual. If there is a dispute because a Brand does not abide by the rights / continues to (ab)use an individual's personal data in breach of the right he/she exercises, Profila as a company will need to be involved as third party to proof that such right was exercises on a specific moment.\n\nFor the data subscriptions, Profila needs to monitor if money is paid by the Brand, and if personal data and other commercial data by the individuals is filled in/updated. This is a liability for both contracting parties, who would need to trust Profila.\nIn both cases, we, as a commercial company, would have to actively step in as arbitrator/mediator, and guarantee this level of trust that a transaction took place/contract was concluded + terms thereof. However, we only want to provide consumers with the tools to control their data. The trust and consensus that a transaction took place or contract was made needs to come from the community of users.\n\nIssue 2 - \"low-value; high volume payments\" - The data license fee and any other fees for attention to be paid to users are currently setup using Stripe, which is not entirely ideal for sending very low-amount, high-volume instant payments worldwide. What is Mitsubishi, as a Japanese brand, needs to pay a US consumer on Profila for seeing an add? We would have to bill Mitsubishi 0.40 USD for displaying the add and transfer our US customer 0,20 USD. This takes time, administration, and will include large payment processing fees (compared to the amount transferred). Considering the amount of customers of the Profila App (25.000 expected in 2021; 78.200 expected in 2022), this payout model doesn't scale. We have setup monthly payouts to consumers (in bulk, for several activities with several brands combined) to reduce costs of transferring money, but we would want to be able to instantly pay a consumer.\n\nWhat do we seek to create in the POCs under this Challenge?\n\nUnder the Catalyst project (fund 5), we want to tackle these 2 issues by including smart contracts (which executes themselves and don't require Profila as intermediary monitoring entity) and paying the compensation out via ADA. See \"illustration 5 - Profila Catalyst - 2 POC use cases illustrated\"\n\nFirst, we will include the relevant elements of a data subject / privacy right (POC 1) or of a data subscription (POC 2) in an immutable (Cardano) blockchain ledger, so each individual has an audit trail of every such transaction (=privacy right exercised) or interaction with a brand (=data subscription contract) that concerned the use of its personal data.\n\nData subject rights ledger POC 1– a ledger for all privacy interactions that you as an individual exercised via the Profila privacy rights management platform: each user that exercises a data subject right with a brand will be able to easily access each such request, including the brands' response.\n\nE.g. You exercises your right to object to the processing of direct marketing messages to Wholefoods, after receiving 15 mails per week with advertising. If several months after this request, Wholefoods doesn't abide by this request and again starts using your personal data to send you direct marketing messages, you can use the ledger entry as immutable proof of the right you exercised. (unlike the \"unsubscribe\" buttons you click 10x times, with no proof thereof, and with no effect because mails keep on coming).\n\nSubscriptions ledger POC 2 – a ledger of all data license contract you concluded with different Brands, showing every authorization or consent he/she gave to each company for the use of your (personal) data.\n\nNobody would be able to tamper with this information. If a company misuses your data, you can make them accountable by referring to the ledger entry. You can even use the information in the blockchain to file a complaint at a national data protection authority, showing them what you agreed to, and how the company actually (mis)used your data. This is control.\nSecond, we want to integrate cryptocurrency payments using ADA, so that people can receive instant micropayments for their personal data and attention if the terms of the smart contract remain fulfilled. Our vision is that by the time the online advertisement market reaches USD 982.82 billion by 2025, every USD of that budget that gets spend via Profila, goes to our users in the form of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat other challenges are ahead in our \"Zero-knowledge advertising & insights\" development roadmap?\n\nThis smart-contract project is only the first step into our broader Cardano technology adoption and integration around zero-knowledge advertising and insights, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. Under the next funds, we want to submit additional project proposals for important features we want to develop as part of this effort:\n\n- step 1 - personal data license smart contract - this is part of the present submission. This will include a ledger for all data license contract concluded between individuals and businesses. under Fund 4 \"dapps and integrations\", we already submitted this first step in our \"zero knowledge advertising and insights\" project called \"Dapp to control and monetize your data\". https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/341501-48088, which we now file again in addition to step 2, \"privacy ledger\".\n\n- step 2 - privacy ledger - this is part of the present submission. This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform.\n\n- step 3 (for FUND 6 or later) - zero-knowledge proofs - personalized ads with respect of privacy - using zero-knowledge proofs in order to allow a brand to advertise to the \"perfect\" consumer (meaning to the exact target audience consumer, which exactly matches the specific offering/message a brand wants to share), without sharing ANY personal data with the brand. This in se means that a brand is doing highly relevant and personalized advertising, and a very high cost of conversion (and low cost of engagement), without the privacy risks that the current surveillance marketing model has (=namely, the model requires large amounts of personal data in order to personalize advertising). We will be able to tell when a consumer wants to see an add from which brand, without having to tell the brand who this consumer actually is. Only when the consumer converts (and actually buys a product or service) on the brand's own system, will the brand have access to his/her personal data.\n\n- Step 4 - digital ID (for FUND 7 or later) - Atala implementation - All digital ID data can be securely stored and encrypted on a user's device, using Cardano 's decentralized public key infrastructure. Each individual can allow organisations access thereto as permissioned by the user; With this integration, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments.\n\n4. Practical aspects – \"show us the money\" – costs\n\nVia this submission, we are requesting 42.400 USD funding to develop the 2 POCs:\n\nStep 1 - Creating a first proof of concept (POC) on the Cardano blockchain of a ledger that stores each transaction from the privacy rights management platform, namely when a user X exercised a data subject right Y towards the Brand Z. will require at least a budget of 19.200 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 15 days of senior blockchain developer @ 800 EUR per day – totaling 12.000 USD\n- 15 days of web/backend developer @ 240 EUR per day – totaling +/- 3.600 USD\n- 15 days of app developer @ 240 EUR per hour – totaling +/- 3.600 USD\n\nStep 2 - Creating a first proof of concept (POC) of a data subscription on the Cardano blockchain, will require at least a budget of 23.200 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 20 days of senior blockchain developer @ 800 EUR per day – totaling 16.000 USD\n- 15 days of web/backend developer @ 240 EUR per day – totaling +/- 3.600 USD\n- 15 days of app developer @ 240 EUR per hour – totaling +/- 3.600 USD\n\nWe are currently already preparing for the development of this solution – which we are trying to pre-finance – because we believe this is a very important functionality in the control of your data. We expect the solution to be ready by the end of Q2 2021, early Q3 2021, so that we can test it with the companies that are now using the Profila app with their consumers.\nWho will be the senior blockchain developer? We are currently in tasks with IOHK's professional services department (option 1) and are \"seeking\" in parallel a blockchain developer in the Catalyst community (=those who are interested, please contact myself or Shawn).\n\n5. Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer\n\nAt the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 5, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.\n\n(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila. These campaigns will show the benefits of Profila (=individual in control; individual compensated) and will attract the first customers to join this kind of new loyalty program. It is therefore not necessary that all the brands' customers join, but mostly the loyal customers that want to be engaged. We project that for SME companies, around 5% of their existing customer base will join this \"new relationship\" in the first year/after the promotional campaign. This would be seen as a success.\n\nWe have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021. According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 in 2022 (by adding more brands).\n\n(2) Geographical focus market? We are currently launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q1/Q2 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).\n\n(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy \"Millennials\" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old), and \"brand-loyalists\" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).\nFollowing a research collaboration we conducted with the University of St. Gallen University of Zurich (Switzerland) to define our go-to-market strategy, we concluded that Millennials are the target consumer audience. Millennials carry out most of their transactions online and are aware of their digital footprint. They are also aware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it. Our research also showed that brand-loyalists are more likely to put in the time required to manage their relationship with brands, and to actively tell the brand what content they want to receive, via which channels.\n\n(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.\n\n(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end-of-April 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).\n\n6. Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)\n\nAs an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:\n\nFirst, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.\n\nSecond, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.\n\nIn addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.\n\nFinally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.\n\n7. Defining success\n\nThe 2x POC we are developing (and hope to get funded for) under this first Catalyst (fund 5) submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to provide people with control of their data and compensation for their attention. Success of the POC would be that we can integrate it into our existing App with one of the 5 SME brands that are testing, and make sure it works with their consumers, and their consumers can get paid via an integrated or linked ADA wallet.\n\nSucces after 3 months - finalizing the POC work to be tested in the App\n\nSucces after 6 months - running targeted trials with the POC in the App with real customers\n\nSucces after 12 months - full deployment of the smart contract POC in the App; covering every interaction that includes privacy rights from every user.\n\nOverview of the work-packages which technical requirements and sprints to be included shortly.\n\n8. Responses to community advisors' reviews under Fund 4\n\nWe want to end our proposal by thanking the community (advisors) for their numerous great feedbacks during the review phase of our proposal under Fund 4, where we submitted this first step in our \"zero knowledge advertising and insights\" project called \"Dapp to control and monetize your data\". https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/341501-48088\n\nWe are very grateful and humbled by the 3,55/5 score we received from the 36 reviewers, who showed they read our proposal in detail and who provided valuable feedback. #thankyouADAcommunity\n\nWe wanted to briefly respond to some open questions of those of the 36 who made some reservations.\n\nAdoption GTM\n\n\"[…] without seeing a business plan that addresses how the Dapp will scale. How will we get to 78,000 users\"? and \"[…] how to go from development to millennial adoption\"\n\nProfila answer: We have provided more information about our go to marketing in point 5 \"Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\", the first title \"Go-To-Market\".\n\nMarketing / website low\n\n\"[…] there is not much mentioned about the marketing of the project, and the website could do a bit of work, so the team could possibly turn attention to this eventually\"; and \"More information regarding the onboarding process of marketing channels and how it could be deployed in social media platforms could strengthen a bit more the angle\" (CA comments)\n\nProfila answer: Agree! We have been focusing our 3 years R&D time and funds on the product and are just starting with our marketing messaging/social media presence/website revamp. Stay tuned during the next weeks for substantial progress there! You can already follow us on Linked \"Profila – Relationships Redefined\" - https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy and our Website www.profila.com should be updated before the end of the month April 2021.\n\nBAT/brave comparison\n\"This is interesting solution to a relevant problem, but the proposal is very similar to the Brave/BAT protocol which is well established.\" (CA comment)\n\nWe are definitely BRAVE fans (and have been following them since 2018)! Although there are some similar goals when it comes to the post-cookie advertising market (zero-knowledge), Profila has a different angle in many ways.\n\nBrave doesn't use third party cookie tracking and uses also zero-knowledge proofs to show you \"relevant\" adds (if you choose to), but this relevance is based on – again – your (web browsing) activity on the brave browser. Just as in normal advertisement via other browsers, there is no context around why / and Brave doesn't really know you + can't do anything outside of its own browser. If I – as a 30-year-old Belgian lawyer – search the internet for \"glitter dog toys\" because my client wants to know if there are competitors on the market, Brave might think I am a dog owner who wants to buy toys.\nAs we detailed in our proposal: our consumer app focuses on creating meaningful relationships with brands/companies that you as an individual choose, and where you define the parameters of the relationship, namely when can they (directly) contact you, via which channels (e.g. Profila app, e-mail, post, phone), and what content you want to receive from them as well as the frequency thereof. We are merely a facilitator of this new 1-1 relationship but provide tools to empower consumers.\nThe competitive landscape illustration in our slide deck attached shows that our mobile application for consumers is an over the top (OTT) opportunity in people-centric customer communications across four markets (of which some include Brave's market, see Brave logo in column 1 and 3 of the slide \"competitive landscape\" in the PDF pitch deck attached to this proposal), namely:\n\n(i) individual privacy rights management and education,\n(ii) personal data and insights marketplace,\n(iii) advertising and customer content, and\n(iv) customer communication.\n\nWe are working on a plugin for browsers to help enforce each person's preferences and relationship with certain brands as defined in the consumer App.\n\nNo Cardano mention on website\n\n\"team […] available on the website*. However, ADA / Cardano is not mentioned even once […] I get a feeling that you wanted to do this anyway and now you jumped on the opportunity to finance the developer's work via Project Catalyst\" (CA comment)\n\nProfila answer: We have heard Dor on the weekly townhalls talk numerous times about \"how to engage entrepreneurs to join Catalyst\", and under Fund 5, there is even a challenge \"Proposer Outreach\", describing \"How can we encourage entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds?\". If we want to get more entrepreneurs to the space, why would you penalize us for joining? (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/25943).\nWe are entrepreneurs that fell in love with IOHK technology and are determined to integrate them into our existing solution and build further on top of it!\n\nData protection laws and compliance\n\n\"The proposal doesn't mention the several Data Protection Legislation frameworks that exist worldwide and how they would navigate this and ensure they operate within the legal framework\" (CA comment)\n\nProfila answer: As a privacy lawyer with work experience in Europe, Switzerland, and the United States, I am well aware of international privacy legislation and all of its ins-and-outs. First, our App is privacy compliant with GDPR as a best-practice and high standard privacy law. Second, the data subscription process is merely a way for consumer and brands to interact in a more transparent way, with control by the consumer. It is the brand's responsibility to provide clear and complaint information to the consumer about the processing of personal data in the jurisdiction they find themselves, and its for the consumer to accept his. Profila will not act as a public authority/enforcer/privacy agency to control the privacy terms of their relationship, nor will Profila monitor the brand's privacy obligations under local law. It is the brand's responsibility to collect and use personal data within its legal framework.\n\nIf you have any specific privacy questions, I would be more than happy to elaborate.\n\nBudget low for a big project which might require multiple funding rounds\n\n\"The budget and timeline seem way too low\"; \"I do believe however that the plan and budget for the task described is not sufficient\" and \"The only \"risk\" would be that the funding is currently dependent on 4 rounds of funding from Project Catalyst, however, the amount asked for is reasonable and the team is looking for other avenues of funding as well\" and \"only thing to keep in mind is that it's a long-term project which might take multiple rounds of funding. (CA comments)\n\nProfila answer: we agree that our aspirations are big, but we also understand that its necessary to start small and test out what works. It is therefore that we started this phased approach to file parts of our solution in steps. We believe that the current budget will allow us to develop these POCs. If it turns out the need additional funds, we will refile a submission explaining the use of the first funds and why we require more.\n\n9.

The two agree on a 500 ADA price and Bob is requesting Alice to send him the NTF promising her that he will send the 500 ADA as soon as he receives the NFT. Alice does not like the idea and she requests Bob to send the 500 ADA first promising him that she will send the NFT to him as soon as she receives the payment. They both have a point here, since they don't know each other. This lack of trust could prevent the transaction from happening for a simple but justified reason. This is where the solution we will be implementing shows its utility. Thereby, Alice sends the NFT to the escrow address, so does Bob by sending the 500 ADA. As soon as both reach the escrow address, in a fully automated way Alice receives the 500 ADA and Bob the NFT, and all just for a small fee.\nThe dApp:\nOn top of the smart contract, which will enable non human interaction, a slick web interface will be built for the interested parties to initiate and complete the process in a seamless way.\nInitiating the escrow\nOne of the two interested parties will initiate the escrow service by specifying the terms of the agreements:\n\nThe assets involved in the exchange and the quantity, this can be either ADA or any other native token\nWhenever ADA is involved in the transaction, a 0,25% transaction fee will be applied up to a maximum(to be determined). In any other case, until price oracles become available on Cardano(see roadmap) a fixed fair fee will be applied\nThe cardano addresses involved in the transactions, to prevent third party to interphere\nA time constraint for the deal to be closed\nA unique identifier will be generated, which will allow all the interested parties to monitor the status of the service and receive instructions on how to complete the transactions. As soon as the involved parties send the assets to the escrow service the exchange will occur automatically. If the deal expires or one of the two parties does not want to execute it anymore, any asset already sent to the escrow will be sent back.\nEnabling more use cases:\nFour more flavours of the basic smart contract will be implemented:\n1. Crowdfunding smart contract\nThis smart contract flavour will enable the crowdfunding use case. The intiatior will describe the initiative and the target amount to be reached and a deadline. The escrow service will accept contributions from all the interested parties and the funds will be locked until either the target is reached or the deadline expires. In case the target gets reached the amount will be transferred to the initiator, otherwise all the funds will be returned to the contributors\n2. Trusted third party\nThis smart contract flavour will be useful when a trusted third party needs to be involved to settle the transaction. In this case, once all the involved assets are sent to the escrow service the exchange won't be happening automatically but will need to be triggered by a trusted third party allowing him/her to perform the needed due diligence\n3. Vesting and Team Distribution\nThis smart contract flavour will allow to lock any asset in the escrow, defining a vesting policy to gradually distribute those assets over time to a set of predefined addresses. An example of usage might be locking newly minted tokens for a new project built on Cardano for a given amount of time(vesting) and gradually distribute them to the developers, in a fully transparent and verifiable manner.\n4. PoolTogether style lottery\nPoolTogether is a popular Ethereum lottery dApp, which allows participants to get their assets back in case they don't win.\nThe participants lock their assets in the escrow for a given amount of time, in the meantime the assets in the escrow are put to work ideally on a #defi platform gaining interests or simply being staked and earning rewards. The lottery's prize is simply the interests accrued in this period and everyone else(the losers) get their assets back. The bigger the participation the higher the prize. The winner will then randomly and transparently selected among the participants.\nFunding:\nThe team is requesting 8000$ to cover the expenses for operating and implementing the MVP solution within 3 months:\nservers, licenses and tools: 600$\nbuilding the base smart contracts plus the 4 additional flavours: 2500$\nbuilding the dApp, a responsive web application optimized for desktop and mobile to interact with the basic smart contract implementation: 2500$\nSetting up a proper build pipeline to automate building/deployment of the solution: 800$\nbuilding a series of automated UI tests for the dApp: 800$\nmanual pre-production QA testing of the solution, including non functional tests: 800$\nRoadmap:\n***The requested amount covers the first 3 months only***, nonetheless the roadmap presented here outlines the whole vision for the next 12 months:\nWithin 3 months:\nCoding, testing and deploying the basic smart contract plus the 4 additional flavours first both on testnet and mainnet\nGo live with the MVP dAPP which will allow the interaction with the basic smart contract on Q3 2021, or in alternative as soon as the Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator Events takes place\nWithin 6 months:\nFurther enhance the MVP to include optional email notifications and other nice-to-have features\nImplementing a second dApp interacting with the crowdfunding smart contract flavour, hence releasing a comprehensive crowdfunding web platform\nBuild a tokenomics model for the release of a native asset on the Cardano platform related to the project\nWithin 12 months:\nIntegrate the dApps with the Yoroi dApp connector(Metamask like) to significantly improve the user experience\nImplement 2 additional dApps interacting with the Third Party and Vesting and Team Distrubtion smart contract flavours\nIntegrate price oracles to better determine fees on transactions involving native tokens rather than ADA\nRelease a mobile version of the dApps\n\n \nAll the collected transaction fees will be used to support the development of the platform.\nAll the produced code will be made freely available under an Apache 2.0 License and published on github.\nLinkedin profile of the main submitter: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ottavio-monzione-470b1626/\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350661-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350634-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nTo start, we all know that taxes are not a sexy topic.\nEveryone wants to have fun with Defi and trading now, and then think about the tax consequences later. The problem with current crypto tax software is that most are trying to be so widely inclusive in their attempt to capture every crypto and blockchain out there, that they cannot read and parse on chain activity very well, if at all. In addition, most other software is unable to read the the separate staking key that Cardano uses, which creates a situation where most crypto tax software implementations lack the ability to create a comprehensive snapshot of the user's tax situation from all of their blockchain activity. Further, the multi-asset nature of Cardano creates unknow and issues that cannot be identified until encountered, which will require special attention and organization.\n\n \n\nSimple Example:\nUser sends 2 units of crypto to a smart contract and in the future receives back 2.4 units. In almost all instances of current tax software, the software cannot easily link the transactions to separate the gain and the basis from that trade, and the user would need to manually split their gains from the trades and create a new item in their personal accounting (as in outside of the software) for that gain and the accompanying tax basis.\n\n \n\nCurrent Team:\nBill Najmy will serve as the project manager and tax compliance lead. Bill is a US tax attorney licensed in the state of Florida, with an LL.M Masters in the laws of taxation. Bill has written multiple academic papers about US tax policies related to cryptocurrency transactions. Prior to tax law, Bill was a project manager for the Asolo Center for Performing Arts, and regularly managed production projects whose budgets ranged upwards of $1,000,000. Bill is also familiar with the basics of software development, and has begun creating a similar software implementation on the Tezos blockchain. The listed website is the working model of this software, called Back to Basis . Tax\n\n \n\nProject Goal:\nThe number one goal is to create a cost effective US based tax compliance software, that is ideally free to for most users, as well as eventually handle international tax compliance. The second priority goal of this project is to create tax tool that can grow with the Cardano ecosystem, especially in the Defi area, as well as meet the specific needs of the Cardano platform and community.\nThe result will be a report of the comprehensive tax picture for the user that includes the determination of income from staking ADA, any gain or loss from selling ADA, income from receiving payments in ADA for any other reason, and the potential tax liability form sales or exchanges of ADA that was received, but not purchased. All of this, plus the inclusion of how to factor in native tokens, and what results from interacting with smart contracts.\n\n \n\nProject Phases:\nThis project will require hiring no more than 2 professional freelance software developers. At least 90% of any secured funds will go towards this portion of the project.\n$!5,000 - The first phase of this project is to develop a private and stable price oracle and REST-API database bridge that is suitable for traditional tax finance reporting purposes. While there are other API's available, none currently have all the features necessary to facilitate this project. Part of the sustainability of the project will be to sell access to oracle and API to third parties.\n\n \n\n$12,000 - The second phase of this project is to develop a useful web-based front end that creates a simple and intuitive user experience. The goal of the second phase will be to generate tax reports based on the users on chain activity. This phase will still require users to self report their tax liability.\n\n \n\n$8,000 - The third phase of the project is to be able to generate useful tax forms that the user can then take to their own tax professional or use in conjunction with self filing with their respective tax authority.\n\n \n\nWorking Product Expected Q1 of 2022","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350629-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350627-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPrototype Phase\n\n- Establish basic functionality and comms between Cardano Node and BTCPay Server.\n\n- Entirety of work would occur in a forked BTCPay Server repository\n\n- Essentially a mapping of Cardano API to BTCPay Server API.\n\nMVP Phase\n\n- Ensure easy deployment via Docker / Docker Compose\n\n- Ensure high quality user experience for Yoroi Mobile users and Daedalus users.\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n- Enable support for multi-asset payments.\n\nThis is a low risk / high reward project. This could easily be executed by a single developer (myself) due to the small scope of the project.\n\nI am confident that I can execute on the vision for the project, and I am excited about what it could mean for the Cardano Developer community. We could finally have easily deployed web payments.

Based on Yelp's Sep 2020 Economic Impact Report, 60% of the closed businesses won't be reopening.\n\n \n\nGoal\nTo build an economy that empowers Local and Small Businesses and uses Crypto Economics to incentivize developers to solve small businesses' problems and consumers to shop locally.\nAs a step towards achieving our ambitious goal, we are building a decentralized UberEats during phase one, we focus on supporting local restaurants with their delivery and cash flow issues. We have a group of restaurants signed up and starting a learning pilot in Northern Virginia, USA. It is just a step towards building an entire economic system that empowers small businesses.\n\n \n\nSolution\nFor struggling restaurants that depend on delivery or takeout orders, Valorem is a food delivery and takeout dapp with Tokenomics designed to help restaurants and delivery drivers be profitable and improve their cash flow, not barely survive. Unlike other platforms such as UberEats or Doordash, we use Tokenomics to incentivize consumers to shop locally and developers to build small business solutions and fund/improve restaurants' cash flow via NFT gift cards.\n\n \n\nRoad Map\n\nPiot (covered by this funding round):\n\nA learning pilot in Northern Virginia, USA\nMobile and web apps and no blockchain backend\n\nPhase One MVP (covered by this funding round)\n\nRestaurant and consumers app\nReferral program\n\nPhase One Main Launch (will need another round of funding/not covered by this funding)\n\nDriver app\nGift Cards\nAmbassador program\n\nPlease check the road map picture attached for the full roadmap and launch dates and the attached whitepaper for more details.\n\nWhat are the funds used for (for more features and future plans, please check the attached roadmap and white paper)\n\nPrompt\n\n \n\nHow might we empower independent restaurants to provide economically efficient delivery and take-out services while providing a delightful experience to their customers?\n\n \n\nFeatures\n\nDelivery and takeout food orders:\nValorem connects restaurants and consumers and uses token economics to nudge each actor towards the desired behavior in a decentralized manner. Restaurants define their prices and offers. This round's fund won't cover the driver app. Restaurants will run their own delivery. To learn more about the future state of the dapp, please, check the whitepaper.\n\nHow to maintain service quality?\nRestaurants are morally and legally responsible for providing their services on Valorem.\n\n \n\nRestaurants have to go through a KYC process.\nRestaurants can block specific customers and not serve them.\nWe use escrow service to make sure orders are delivered successfully before releasing the funds.\nHow restaurants capture value\nNo transaction fee means restaurants save 27%+ of their revenue taken by centralized food ordering platforms.\nThey have the opportunity to build personal relationships with customers by directly responding and resolving customers' issues.\nEarning rewards in Valorem tokens.\nHow consumers capture value\nSave 41%+ on food prices compared to centralized food ordering platforms.\nEarning rewards in Valorem tokens\n\nDispute resolution:\nWe believe that businesses have to take moral and legal responsibility for their actions for such a decentralized system to work. We aim at nudging consumers and businesses towards resolving any disputes between themselves\n\nHow it works\nThe customer files a claim.\nBusiness (restaurant or/and driver) receives notification and has three days to resolve the dispute.\nResults:\nThe business decides to reward/refund the user ( resolved). Business gets extra reputation points.\nThe user withdraws the claim. Nothing happens\nNo resolution. Reputation points subtracted from the restaurant. No transaction rewards given for any of the users involved in the transaction. The customer is refunded. Customer and store prevented from rewards for their next order.\nConsiderations\nWe want to ensure the business taking responsibility for running their business while making it hard for consumers to abuse the network. The restaurant can block orders from a specific user, which will impact the users' reputation. Still, if they ignore a users' dispute, restaurants will get reputation points subtracted from their accounts.\n\n \n\nReputation points:\n\nAt the time of registration, a network actor has 0 reputation points.\nNetwork actors get reputation points added to their accounts with every successful transaction.\nWith every unresolved dispute or low rating received, reputation points are subtracted from the network actors.\nReputation has a significant effect on voting power and rewards received by each network actor.\nPhase two:\nEach local community can vote on removing a business from the network in the case of sustaining a bad reputation over a period of time\n\n \n\nPayments:\n\nStable Token/Fiat\nStores have to buy a specific amount of stable tokens in their wallets. Users will be able to exchange fiat for stable tokens directly at any restaurant in the network. Users can pay using these stable tokens at any restaurant in the network. For future payment options, please check the whitepaper.\nCrypto Payment\nUsers can pay with Valorem tokens and ADA. Businesses can choose to keep the crypto or exchange it for fiat/stable coins on the spot.\nEscrow\nWe will use an existing on-chain escrow service to hold the payment in an escrow service for a day. If it doesn't exist on the Cardano network, we will build an escrow smart contract. If the user didn't initiate a dispute within a day, the money will be released to the business. If the user initiates a dispute, we will hold the payment for three more days or until the dispute is resolved—whatever happens first.\n\n \n\nAccount/Identity management:\n\nOne of the challenges facing blockchain adoption is identity management. Users find it hard to keep a private key or 15 words with no way to retrieve the account if the information were lost. We will be using AIKON to handle user registration including allowing users to use email, Facebook, and Gmail without risking users' data.\n\n \n\nReferral program\n\nRestaurants, drivers, and users will be rewarded in Valorem token to refer their customers to use Valorem instead of other centralized platforms. Restaurants, drivers, and users will get rewarded when the referred user completes his/her first order.\n\n \n\nTokenEconomics\nPlease, check the attached Token Economics Canvas for a quick review. To learn more about the how rewards work and the details of the logic behind the Token Economics Canvas, please, check the whitepaper.\n\nGovernance\n\nFor the five years after the official launch, Valorem will be governed by the founding team. We will be designing the governing process based on three different governing levels.\n\nGlobal governance: Governing the network as a whole including network offering expansion, economics, maintaining the market quality\nLocal community governance: Governing each local community on the network including network offering expansion, economics, maintaining the market quality. Our assumption is it will be a country-level governing, but we will have to validate the assumption during the first phase.\nSuppliers governance (work in progress): We aim at helping small businesses work together to increase their purchasing power.\n\n \n\nFunding\nWe already have a non-blockchain MVP app to launch in the pilot phase. This is a scrappy version that was built in one day for learning purposes.\n\nWe are raising $50,000 that will cover:\n\n$7,000 for UX and dev of restaurant app\n$7,000 for UX and dev of consumer app\n$10,000 Valorem token and basic smart contracts dev\n$6,000 for the pilot operations\nWithin the next four months we will raise another round of funding to cover:\nThe driver app\nGift cards feature\n\n \n\nTeam\n\nMo Behairy\nBased in Virginia, USA\nProduct manager: Capital One, IBM, and Cybrary\nBuilt two food delivery startups in Egypt and the USA\nHolds a Masters of Science in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadshaaban/\nUmoh Bassey-Duke\n\n \n\nBased in Amsterdam, Netherlands\nPlutus Pioneer\nSenior Software Engineer\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/umoh-bassey-duke-2951b71b/\nHisham Ibrahim\nBased in California, USA\nFormer VP of Innovation at PayPal and VP of Product at Intuit\nDesign Thinking and Innovation instructor at Berkley\nCreator of the Customer-Driven Innovation framework\nFounded a food delivery startup with Mo in California\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hisham/\nEman Herawy\nBased in Cairo, Egypt\nDevcon scholar at Ethereum\nBlockchain full stack developer\nKERNEL Fellow at Gitcoin\nFounder of Arabs in Blockchain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanherawy/\nAbdulrahman Ismail\nBased in Istanbul, Turkey\nFull-stack web and mobile developer\nMahassin Qoudri\nBased in Nigeria\nAttorney\nBlockchain developer\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahassin-l-quadri/\n\n \n\nChallenge key metrics and questions\n\nValorem is already starting a pilot soon, and the team is committed\nThe challenge we are solving exists everywhere in the world.

PMX, the native cryptocurrency will be earned in gameplay enabling gamers to get paid to play videogames (first game will be Fortnite) and be used to mint and trade items as well as govern the PlayerMint DAO as the system decentralizes. Gamers are the perfect audience to build a high value decentralized application for. They understand digital assets and economies and voluntarily engage with them.\n\n- Fund4 Proposal // Phase 1 -\n\nWe are currently engaged in a fund4 proposal to build out the PlayerMint protocol as a Discord bot. You can view this proposal here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/PlayerMint-Token-System-for-Gamers/340535-48088. The fund5 proposal you are reading is to provide additional funding to further develop PlayerMint's position as the mint of the gaming metaverse.\n\n- Fund5 Proposal // Phase 2 -\n\nPlayerMint Phase 2 is all about becoming the mint of the metaverse. This begins with building a website that supports the PlayerMint protocol. This website would become the main hub of PlayerMint, allowing the user base to connect their social platform accounts (Discord, Twitch in future) and their gaming accounts (Epic Games). This hub would also be used as the main place for users to mint and safely manage their tokens. The Phase 1 Discord bot is to provide a social environment for the community to form. The Phase 2 website is to provide a quality user centric hub that PlayerMint can use to launch the protocol onto other social platforms and into virtual game environments.\n\n- User Experience -\n\n1. Head to playermint.com\n2. Create an account (username and email)\n3. Create a wallet\n4. Link social and gaming accounts (Discord and Epic Games)\n5. Play Fortnite\n6. Receive payouts of PMX\n7. Use PMX to mint and trade NFTs\n\n- Development Roadmap and Use of Funding -\n\n100% of the Catalyst funds will go towards PlayerMint's dev group Kromeon (https://kromeon.com/) to build Phase 2. Kromeon will get paid in two separate instances. The first instance PlayerMint will pay Kromeon $15k at the beginning of the development process. The second instance, of $15k, will occur at the end of the development process. Kromeon's development and payment process is listed below.\n\n \n\n- Phase 2 Development (18 Weeks) -\nInitial Payment // $15k\nInitial Discovery Meeting // 2 Days // To Do\nDetermine Product Scope and PRD // 3 Days // To Do\nProduct Design // 5 Weeks // To Do\nProduct Development // 10 Weeks // To Do\nProduct Testing/QA // 2 Weeks // To Do\nFinal Payment // $15k\n\n \n\n- Public Launch Date -\nOur expected public launch date for our fund5 proposal is by the end of September 2021, soon after the Alonzo hard fork.\n\n- Technical Details -\n\nBlockchain Dev Environment: KEVM\nGaming SDK: Epic Online Services\n\n- Business Model -\n\nThe PlayerMint business model has been constructed with the sustainability and longevity of the project in mind. PlayerMint mints PMX every 5 days. This means the years supply of tokens are minted in 73 separate epochs. Each epoch 80% of the minted tokens will fund the prize pool for people to get paid to play. The other 20% of the minted tokens will be distributed to the PlayerMint Team. On the non-fungible side 95% of the initial sale of the PlayerMint NFTs will go to the artist. The other 5% will go to the PlayerMint Team. PlayerMint will also take a 3% royalty on all aftermarket NFT sales. The artist is welcome to set a royalty of their choosing. This business model aligns incentives between the PlayerMint Team and community. In order for the Team to have sustainable revenue the community must be receiving meaningful payouts of PMX and see reason to mint and trade NFTs.\n\n- Metrics of Success - Goals Set for 3 // 6 // 12 Months -\n\n1. Unique addresses holding PMX\n10k // 50k // 200k\n2. Daily active addresses as measured by a transaction (2% of unique addresses)\n200 // 1k // 4k\n3. NFT sale volume\n10k // 100k // 1m\n4.

This is a staged approach to tokenomics that will start simply and progress to intermediate and eventually become a full complex governance token incentive method.\n\nBACKGROUND\nNFT-DAO is emerging from the Project Catalyst community as a collective of 300+ like-minded individuals looking to pool resources and develop an NFT framework on Cardano. Since forming, NFT-DAO has merged or collaborated with 18 Catalyst proposers from Funds 2-5. NFT-DAO is an emergent organisation that is constantly iterating and learning how to work with new and diverse individuals, and considering a range of different viewpoints and ideas. We have looked to Cardano and Project Catalyst as an inspiration for what a collaborative community is and can become. We are also aware of the challenges Project Catalyst faces as it grows in scale and reach, including the challenges of maintaining standards of quality in such a fast-growing environment. Our goal is not only to watch and learn from these challenges, but to align any solutions that may arise between our organisations, and that may apply to other current or prospective DAO's forming in the space.\n\nIn our commitment to develop a collaborative economy dedicated to NFT's, we registered NFT-DAO as a DAO-LLC under Wyoming law in March 2021.\n\nThis is a Proposal by:\nNFT-DAO, a Project Catalyst Fund3 Recipient for a Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework on Cardano. NFT-DAO is a community of 300+ members composed of Developer, UX/UI, Governance, Creative and Marketing holons (working groups). Our motto: 'We work better together'.\n\nNFT-DAO Fund3 Proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088\nWe have also been very humbled by the vote of support by the Catalyst community in receiving a Fund3 budget allocation. Our holon-teams are busy working toward our major milestones, including delivering a composable marketplace for the community to build on.\n\nCURRENT OPPORTUNITIES\nAlthough we are not near the scale of Project Catalyst, NFT-DAO does have a community of 300+ members, each with varying degrees of engagement and activity within the DAO. Some of the early challenges we have found in building a collaborative community has been:\n1--how we communicate and make decisions within a large community?\n2--how we balance people's right to open discussion (to have a voice and be heard) with finding closure and initiating action?\n3--how to onboard newcomers who may feel overwhelmed by a proliferation of information?\n4--how to implement fair and equitable consensus mechanisms in relation to varying degrees of community input and investment?\n5--how to navigate centralised leadership with distributed ideals?\n6--how to manage dissent, disillusionment or conflicts of interest/ideals?\n7--how to reward contributions for members who are volunteering their time?\n\nIt is apparent that some of the challenges we have experienced in establishing an emerging DAO align with Fund 5's Distributed Decision-Making challenge.\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION\nAs our goal from the start has been to transition toward a decentralised, self-governing and self-organising DAO – as patterned after Cardano – with members being rewarded in proportion to their contributions. Rewards can be distributed in the form of token utilities for contributions made or governance voting/decision-making. The NFT-DAO has been working on a multi-tiered tokenomics model that can be templated and applied within Project Catalyst, and other DAO's who see fit to use it. The principal tiers of the tokenomics model are:\n\n1--A Project Roadmap;\n2--Business Development Stages;\n3--Business Milestones;\n4--Token Sale Rounds;\n5--Token Circulation, with percentage splits;\n6--A Token Utility Development Cycle: a) Contribution Token, b) Governance Voting Token, c) Pro-bono Token, d) Kudos Token, e) Retail Investment Token;\n7--Contribution Metrics captured per Token Development Cycle;\n8--Decentralisation;\n9--Metrics of member engagement levels;\n10--Onboarding Incentives.\n\nA staged approach to tokenomics (that progresses from simple, through intermediate to complex token templates) will enable delivery of tokens in the near, intermediate and long term. Our process for tracking tokens in the near-term will adapt existing solutions such as the Cardano Registry GitHub to capture contributions. Further research and development will be required to explore cross-DAO auditing options, as metric capture will also need to take quantitative and qualitative contributions into account.\n\nNote: A quantitative contribution is objective, material, untrusted, trackable, accountable (something that can be automated in principle). A qualitative contribution is subjective, involves trust, differences, ranges, balances (something that requires human intervention or representation in the form of voting etc.). A quantitative contribution can always be extracted from data.\n\nHow do we encourage people to participate in decision making?\nWithin this tokenomics model, the high-level goal is to eventually develop a machine-assisted collaborative economy, with automation of voting and engagement mechanisms and tokenised rewards. As this is a more advanced stage of development, this proposal aims to implement a holistic tokenomics framework to incentivise Tier 1 level contributions from community members. This means that a Cardano DAO (C-DAO) native token will be minted for the purposes of distributing to Catalyst community members (and other C-DAO's). The distribution of these tokens will be in accordance with contribution metrics, which will also be determined by member engagement levels within Catalyst (and other C-DAO's). Participation will be incentivised through gamification, that allows members to unlock higher tiers and token utility/rewards as they progress through the member pathway.\n\nHow do we ensure the group of decision makers is diverse and accessible to newcomers?\nAdmittedly, this is a meritocratic tokenomic model. We have found from experience that, despite our best intentions at inclusivity, the core actors and decision-makers in the community are comprised of a 'coalition of the willing'. Therefore, a tiered membership pathway will be better able to attract diversity and newcomers by incentivising their contributions, and providing more opportunities for reward as they contribute more.\n\nHow can we ensure that the Catalyst process keeps iterating to improve?\nThe NFT-DAO are developing ways to improve member engagement and rewards via a native NFT-DAO token. Catalyst uses proposals as a means to provide solutions to problems posed by the Catalyst team and the community. One of the tiers within the member pathway is to unlock Bounty Access. The work we are doing in NFT-DAO can also be leveraged across Catalyst if the community agrees with the approach. One approach is, at a certain tier of engagement, the Catalyst team and community can place Bounties for initiatives, solutions or jobs that need to be done in the community (to iterate or improve on an existing idea), and that contributors will be rewarded in C-DAO, ADA or a Pro-Bono native token. Bounties can then be signed off by Community QA's, who also receive a Pro-Bono token for their service. This is our initial idea and can be influenced by collaboration as we move forward.\n\nHow will we include the community in decision making?\nOne of the utilities to be unlocked is governance. This not only means voting for proposals, but for anything. This can potentially work on two fronts:\n\n1--Lower Member Engagement: Contribution tokens can provide a nominal contribution token payment for a lower tier of member engagement in the community, such as voting on a poll. Polls can support a casual form of decision-forming, that can be incentivised;\n\n2--Higher Member Engagement: Governance tokens can provide members with a weighted vote on more pressing community issues, such as voting on a policy. These higher tier utilities require a consistent degree of engagement within the community to be earned (not just the amount of ADA held) so that members with less ADA can build merit and make equitable contributions toward more impactful outcomes.\n\nA solution may arise in the form of a more robust voting dApp (or enhancement of the current one) so that polls can be made available (for Level 1 Contribution Token holders) or governance votes (for higher-level Governance Token holders). A linked wallet can allow members to receive nominal payments for contributions.\n\nROADMAP / COSTS\nTo support the implementation of a holistic tokenisation model for Project Catalyst within the next two Catalyst Rounds, NFT-DAO will merge our own tokenomics development:\n\n \n\nMAY 2021 | FUND 5 CLOSE + FUND 6 OPEN\n\n• Dev Team: Contribution token minting/test/pre-distribution (pre-alpha)\n• Dev Team: Token minting policy\n• Gov Holon: NFT-DAO Charter: terms of engagement\n• Gov Holon: Finalise Tokenomics model\n• Open-source policy (with QA-DAO)\n\n \n\nMONTH COSTS: $7,000\n\nJUNE 2021 | FUND 6 CLOSE + FUND 5 PAYMENT\n• Tokenomics Roll-out / troubleshooting (alpha)\n• C-DAO tokenomics discussion (with DAO Council)\n• Project Catalyst team meetings\n• Metrics capture implementation strategy\n• Ideation with Project Catalyst Voting app team\n• Voting dApp research project\n• Bounty system flow-chart\n• Finalise Rewards system\n• Gamification system design\n\n \n\nMONTH COSTS: $12,000\n\nJULY 2021 | FUND 7 OPEN\n• Tokenomics Roll-out / troubleshooting (beta)\n\n \n\nMONTH COSTS: $5,000\n\nAUG 2021 | FUND 7 CLOSE + FUND 6 PAYMENT\n• Full Tokenomics Roll-out / maintenance\n\n \n\nMONTH COSTS: $5,000\n\nOCT 2021 | FUND 7 PAYMENT\n\nKEY METRICS\n\nProject Metrics will include but are not limited to:\n• Establishing auditable Github repos for all core project tasks;\n• Number of tokens minted;\n• Collaborative partnerships (Catalyst, DAO's);\n• Community consensus/ratification/participation on token rollout;\n• Contribution Metrics per Token Development Cycle;\n• Proof of iteration via rollout staging.\n\nDEFINED SUCCESS REPORTING\n\n3-month: Post funding much of this work will be available to see first hand and can be followed in the Github repository.\n6-month: Active usage of contribution tokens in NFT-DAO.\n12-month: Launch ready governance tokens in NFT-DAO and the stretch goal of Catalyst actually adopting our model for use with the wider community as suggested herein.\n\n \n\nCONCLUSION\nNFT-DAO is an emerging, self-organising community that is patterned after Cardano and Project Catalyst. Having experienced the challenges of building a collaborative community from scratch, we are positioned to support Project Catalyst using a native token model to reward community members for their voluntary contributions. Beginning with the pre-alpha minting of contribution tokens, this project will have potential to stage out into a larger project that supports multiple tiered token utilities and member pathways that incentivise community engagement and higher quality decision-making. In the spirit of collaboration, we aim to do this by working with the Project Catalyst team and community, the QA-DAO (for quality assurance and open-sourcing standards), the Council of Catalyst DAO's; and by testing and trouble-shooting within the NFT-DAO itself.\n\n \n\nTEAM\nTroy Egan (NFT-DAO)\nTroy is an NFT-DAO Co-Proposer and Catalyst Fund3 Co-Recipient; NFT-DAO Governance Holon Lead; PhD student studying collaborative strategies within the creative economies; 20 years' experience in the creative, health and community development sectors in New Zealand and Australia.

Our team of highly skilled developers can complete this phase 2 for the web app in an additional 3 months if funding is available. This gives WADA a tool to streamline / optimize its proposal outreach mission, and therefore make Project Catalyst more accessible and understandable to new users they bring in.\nNext: Team for research and development of DAG has been set from phase 1. Now real research will start to delve into the complexities of category theory and type level programming and how it applies back to Plutus.\nProject Description\nThis proposal covers not only the direct application of Cardano Blockchain core components such as Servant Server, Haskell, Plutus, and Elm into concrete action by creating this integrated management system, but serves as a learning journey for a whole network of developers; driving them towards a bright future in IT.\nOne aspect of WADA's integrated management system that we will create with Plutus is a crowdfunding platform for our membership schemes allowing clear visibility and follow-up on contributions using metadata. Once successful this will be easily replicated to Project Catalyst's platform in terms of the follow-up component for funding as well as offering a model for distributed decision making in how projects get funded.\nSuccess looks like\n3 Months: WADA Integrated management system is fully operational. Website becomes a gateway for proposers in Project Catalyst.\n6 Months: Alternative community crowdfunding platform built with Plutus with follow-up component with metadata history and more direct involvement for all stakeholders (similar to Guanxi but more decentralized and distributed guanxi-invest.com) that can therefore be shared to other platforms such as Project Catalyst to optimize their donation/contribution cycle.\n1 year: Most of WADA's processes will be automated and decentralized. We will be transitioning to structuring WADA as a DAO.\nDeveloper Team requirements for this phase:\nTeam: DITC + WADA Network developers\n3 Web developers (Elm)\n3 Graphic designers\n7 Haskell, Elm, Plutus developers (1 is currently enrolled in Plutus pioneer program)\n1 Artificial Intelligence PhD\n1 Mathematician\n1 Tokenomics expert\nFunding requested will go towards motivations for 3 months\nSenior developer motivations 5 @ $2 K each = $10K\nOther dev/expert council motivations $2K\nPartners and Collaborators\nWADA West Africa Decentralized Alliance is a fast growing community in West and other parts of Africa and the Diaspora. By supporting the \"building of an integrated management system from the ground up…,\" we hope to provide a one-stop platform where our incoming leaders can quickly access information and other resources to easily onboard into Project Catalyst and ultimately Voltaire. Not only does WADA help onboard proposers, but they educate about distributed ledger technology and more specifically Cardano. They are heavily focusing their outreach on making Project Catalyst more accessible to newcomers by thoroughly explaining and supporting the processes from the submission through the voting stage. WADA's outreach is currently limited by their website capacity. Providing the resources to them to make a solid web app/ integrated management system is key to keeping their momentum, and spreading Cardano philosophy throughout Africa.\nDITC Distruptive IT Cameroon is the rebranding of our IT company iServices SARL which was founded in Cameroon in 2017 with five passionate technical and business people. We are in the process of re-branding as a way of merging with WADAs Blockchain Hubs for Solution Design. The core team consists of two senior software architects and developers with strong foundations in functional programming, specifically Haskell and currently working through the new Plutus program. We also have one senior UX web designer. In addition to this throughout the years we have taken on several apprentices and local university students to learn with us and work on projects as they come along. We have lined up several verbal agreements in order to establish a team ready for this specific project with WADA. We will continue to work without funding as a passion project but we will be able to fully engage the full team if funding is granted.\nRousseau International School to host large developer events + Disruptive IT Cameroon DITC training space\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352497-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352495-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThis is an Adagov.org Project.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhy is Open Ideas and Data Important?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe build hierarchical, categorical proposal submission systems that are inefficient for messaging and we ask ourselves: \"Why don't groups cooperate more on Catalyst?\"\n\nThe systems we have are perfectly designed to give us the results we're getting.\n\n \n\nWe need more than to generate proposals:\n\n1. We need a way to assess proposals against a collective direction\n\n2. We need to ensure projects deliver Return On Intent\n\n3. We need to ensure project teams are held accountable and rewarded for their contribution. [6]\n\n \n\nThe goal is to create a more holistic, integrated, community friendly system (initially off-chain) that can expose proposal and review data so that we can build systems that can offer curation and accountability. This will improve processes and systems that will help each funding round and build between the gaps.\n\nCurrently we manually repeat processes with spreadsheets but as we scale, these will have their limits.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Truth About Data\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nData is the core to data-driven decision making - which provides multiple perspectives on the objective truth. The closer we are to truth, the better chance we have at making successful decisions and funding projects and teams that work.\n\nWhen we reinforce these systems with peer-review and allow feedback to occur, we get the best results. [6]\n\nGood data hygiene and systems to support this are fundamental to building the technology that drives our community and dealing with issues of scale, fairness, audit-ability and traceability.\n\nNote: Placing this data on-chain is a separate process to experimenting and defining the way these systems will work.\n\nSummary\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nData Management is the heart of the Project Catalyst Community and key to a Meritocracy. The success of the community depends on the ideas we pick. Every product or offering evolved out of Catalyst will first begin as a proposal within these tools.\n\nWe also want to feed-back these delivery metrics into a believably or merit weighted results to make future rounds easier.\n\nAs an extra we would like to gamify the process further so repetitive work, where it cant be automated, is more engaging and that reviewers who contribute and get it right earn recognition.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWho Is This Proposal For?\n-----------------------------------\nThese tools are for the Project Catalyst community to help:\n1. Voters easily decide who they will vote for in subsequent funds based on performance.\n2. Proposers effectively draft, collaborate and submit their best ideas and find teams as they do so.\n3. Community advisers review, contribute and rate these ideas using supporting tools.\n4. Allow Veteran Community Advisers provide training and feedback ensuring a fair and equitable outcome.\n\n \n\n \n\nIt will improve the following challenge metrics:\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nProof of iteration: Round over round, \"pain points\" like data curation, processing and reporting would evolve.\n\nRe-election rates: More proposers receive subsequent funding.\n\nEmbracing failure: Community would be able to track and see value in & learn from proposals that did and did not work out.\n\n \n\n \n\nAuditability\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nFund 5 Scope: We will comprehensively examine, select and trial and integrate an alternative idea management platform into data analytics and reporting tools so that reviews can take place faster, more effectively and at scale.\n\n[Completed] Develop a requirements framework for open data sharing between ideation and auditing platform.\n\n[Completed] Develop a comprehensive review of idea management and execution platforms [5]\n\n[Completed] Trail free-to-trail services around idea management.

We'll negotiate a better enterprise licence model for our community\n4. We'll negotiate to have developers enhance the tools further as a part of licencing\n5. We'll configure the tech to match the requirements.\n6. Where gaps exist we'll create integrations to connect to other tools.\n7. We'll overcome risk of delivery by leveraging a class of applications known as middleware\n8. We'll ensure integrations can deliver data reliably and securely to publically accessible sources\n9. We'll audit our work to ensure PII is not being leaked\n10. We'll review and present progress regularly to the community.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact\n----------------------\nOur objective is to have a smoothly working alternative dataflow and data reporting setup as soon as possible.\nWe estimate if our Fund 4 vote is successful, we can have such a system by Fund 7.\nWe will continue to work with the community and IOHK in training and handover.\nThe key goals of this project are high impact items for the community:\n1. Automate much of the repetitive work done between funding rounds by community advisors so they can focus on community and proposer issues, growing proposals, maintaining community documentation and standards and providing feedback.\n2. Provide the community with standardised open access to data so they can grow and build out the tooling ecosystem.\n3. Support off-chain decision making with data while on-chain systems are established.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences\n\n----------------------\n\n[1] Catalyst Problem Sensing has 74 out of 223 entries related to incomplete UI / UX or have needed alternate solutions\n\n[2] Project Catalyst Discord [31/03/2021@2:14 PM] #reviewing-the-reviewers.

This time we are looking to create 20 infographics and a also include a motion graphic work.\n\nThe infographics will continue to visually explain Cardano Project Catalyst for use in community communications.\nThe motion graphic work will focus on a short explanation of the insight sharing stage of Project Catalyst. This is a poorly understood part of the process and a motion graphic explanation will provide an easy way to understand the details of the process.\n\nA full list of proposed Infographic will be developed at the time of funding: Explain how the ranking inside of the voting app is being calculated.\n\nAs a part of an experiment for the concept being proposed of adafund.io in Fund 5 https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Co-participation-fund-adafund-io/350662-48088 I developed https://teleolog.art which was a test to. the graphic attached is an example of the work being done by Evgeniya Tranevskaya https://www.instagram.com/etranevskaya/ and will form a part of the body of infographics being developed in this multiple series body of work. Future funding will be sort to continue creating infographics for the community.\n\nBudget\n\nInline with previous development each graphic will cost $200 ($200x20 = $4000). The Motion Graphic I estimate to cost $1000 to develop and create. I have not yet engaged a motion designer but have a number of contacts through my networks who would be able to achieve the task. The Split would be 50/50 between myself to develop and research the concepts and the designer to design them.\n\nRoadmap & Milestones\nThe Project will not take more than three months to complete. The process will start on funding**.**\nDevelop and create a minimum of two info graphics a week for 10 weeks (2 weeks of contingency).\nCreate and deliver the motion graphic in a 10 week time frame.\nLook at build out a more detailed process of funding graphics and engaging a wider range of graphic designers - for future funding rounds.\n\nAbout me\n\nI am a very active community advisors, and I have past experience in business and design. My personal site is philkhoo.com. I am the project lead on developing the community landing page https://cardanocataly.st, and I am active in the development of the CA-tool https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool, vCA-tool https://cardanocataly.st/vca-tool/ and Proposer tools. I actively engage with numerous proposals in the Community Discord Channel, I assist with the introduction of new CAs to the process and actively participate in governance development by assistance in creating important community developed documents such as the CA Guidelines, Red & Yellow Thing.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351735-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n.\n\nCatalyst Assessment and Review Phases Overview\n\nIn the current Catalyst process, after the proposals are finalized, there are three phases before community voting:\n\nCommunity Advisors (CAs) assess the proposals and give them a rating between 1 and 5 in three categories: Impact, Feasibility and Auditability, along with a rationale explaining each rating given;\nProposers review the CAs assessments, when they are able to flag low quality/unfair assessments to be checked by the Veteran Community Advisors (vCAs).\nvCAs review all assessments of all proposals, starting by those flagged by the Proposers in the previous phase.\n\n.\n\nCurrent Problems/Limitations\n\nCurrently, during the assessment phase, CAs have to navigate through IdeaScale website and search for proposals to access. In order to better distribute the assessments between proposals, CAs have to manually search for the least assessed proposals, which is inefficient, tiring and time consuming. During Fund4 a document created by IOG was distributed indicating the proposals that were missing a minimum number of CA reviews.\n\nThe assessments review done by both Proposers and vCAs is currently performed using an Excel sheet, which is functional to perform the job, but in the case of vCAs reviews, there is no coordination during this phase. This leads to an imbalance in the reviews of assessments: some assessments receive lots of reviews, and others receive none.\n\nAs seen in Fund4, CAs and vCAs got overloaded with the amount of proposals they needed to assess and assessments to review. Considering the expected exponential increase in Cardano Project Catalyst's size, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of CAs and vCAs work.\n\n.\n\nProposed Solution\n\nTo solve these problems, we are proposing three tools:\n\nA CA Tool, to automatically suggest a proposal to be assessed by the CA based and his challenge preference and the least assessed proposals;\nA Proposer Tool, to make it easier to go through all the assessments, set them as 'checked' and/or flag them;\nA vCA Tool, to automatically suggest an assessment to be reviews by the vCA based on his filter choices and the least reviews assessments;\n\nThese tools aim to make the process of assessment and review easier, and also to improve/create coordination between CAs and vCAs during these phases.\n\nThe team is already engaged with a plan for each tool, and a prototype each tool is already being designed and built.\n\nWork is currently being done on these tools with the intention to have their prototype operational to be used in Fund5 as an option to the current process. Then, based on users' feedback and team's insights, the prototype will evolve into an improved solution.\n\nSince the CAs and vCAs work is paid by Project Catalyst as well, we believe that these tools will increase the Return on Investment related to these activities.\n\n.\n\nRoadmap\n\nDesign user flow and interface for all three tools - Complete (See: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lN0yFEM=/))\nCreate working prototype of all three tools - CA Tool: Complete. Proposer and vCA: To be complete in time for Fund5 Review-of-Assessments Phase (See: https://cardanocataly.st/proposer-tool , https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool/ , https://cardanocataly.st/vca-tool/))\nImprove prototype based on community feedback after Fund5 (To be done in time for Fund6)\n\n.\n\nKPIs\n\nNumber of CAs that used the CA tool in Fund5. Goal: > 20 CAs or 20% of CAs\nNumber of vCAs that used the vCA tool in Fund5. Goal: > 10 vCAs or 20% of vCAs\nNumber of Proposers that used the Proposer tool in Fund5. Goal: > 30 Proposers or 20% of Proposers\n\n.\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nCA Tool\n\nThe CA Tool is a simple SPA (Single Page Application) based on the JavaScript framework Vue.js.\n\nAll the proposals in the \"Assess\" phase will be preloaded in the tool (using an export provided by the Project Catalyst Team) and the end user will have the opportunity to filter by categories and get a suggestion on the next proposal to be reviewed.\n\nIn parallel, a script will be developed that will keep the number of assessments received by each proposal updated: in this way the suggestion on the next proposal to be evaluated is based on the number of reviews received, with the idea of ​​distributing the work of the CA.\n\nFor each proposal, the CA that will use the tool will have the possibility to mark it as \"reviewed\". This information will be stored in the browser (using the local storage) and it would be useful for the CA to to get an overview about the work already done (and also to double check in a simple way if every review was submitted correctly).\n\n.\n\nvCA Tool\n\nThe VCA Tool is a simple SPA (Single Page Application) based on the JavaScript framework Vue.js.\n\nThe main idea behind the design of this tool is to maintain everything decentralized and compatible with the process followed for Fund4 using Google Sheets.\n\nEvery vCA will receive an export file from the Project Catalyst Team that could be imported into the tool.\n\nUsing the local storage technology through Vuex (a state management library for Vue.js applications), the tool will store locally in the browser all the reviews made by the vCA. For each assessment review completed the client will also increase the counter on the backend. In this way, the updated count of reviews received by each assessment will be always available to the tool used by others vCAs, in order to coordinate better the workload (no specific info about the review will be shared with the server, only the \"reviewed / non reviewed\" state).\n\nThe backend is an API made with node.js connected to redis and deployed to Heroku.\n\nIn addition the vCA will have advanced filters for the assessments (eg. by assessor, proposal, question, rating, length of text and sorted by number of reviews received, random, etc.) and a page with the statistics (of his own work and global).\n\nWhen the vCA has finished he can simply export the file with his reviews and share it with the Project Catalyst Team.\n\nThe files (import and export) used by the vCA Tool are fully compatible with the process followed for Fund4, so it is not mandatory to use it and a vCA can still use Google Sheet.\n\n.\n\nProposer Tool\n\nThe Proposer Tool is really similar to the vCA Tool, but some features are excluded from it.\n\nThe Proposer Tool is a simple SPA (Single Page Application) based on the JavaScript framework Vue.js.\n\nEvery proposer will receive an export file containing the assessments received for their own proposal. Using the local storage technology through Vuex (a state management library for Vue.js applications), the tool will store locally in the browser all the flags reported by the proposer.\n\nWhen the Proposer has finished he can simply export the file with the assessments reported and share it with the Project Catalyst Team.\n\nThe files (import and export) used by the vCA Tool are fully compatible with the process followed for Fund4, so it is not mandatory to use it and a vCA can still use Google Sheet.\n\n.\n\nCosts Breakdown\n\nDesign user flow and interface for all three tools: $1000\nCA Tool Frontend Development: $600\nvCA Tool Frontend Development: $800\nvCA Tool Backend Development: $200\nProposer Tool Frontend Development: $600\nProject admin and management: $1400\n\n.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350981-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n.\n\n________ I M P A C T _________\n\n \n\nPROBLEM\n\nCatalyst is a fast-growing decentralized crowdfunding platform where the community advisors play an important role. They assess the proposals and thereby lay the foundation for the voters about which proposal they chose to get funded. As I went through the assessments from previous funds, I saw many good ones but also a large number of inadequate assessments.\n\nTherefore, I asked myself this question:\n\n\"How can we deal with the fast growth and ensure that every community advisor has the same understanding of the assessment criteria?\"\n\n \n\nSOLUTION\n\nThe solution to this problem is an online tutorial for community advisors. This video series will prepare community advisors to assess proposals in the best possible way to give valuable feedback to the proposers and to help to make the voters better decisions. A video contains following advantages compared to a written guideline (like the CA assessment guide):\n\nVisual and auditory elements enable a better learning of the content\nVisual comparisons increase the overall understanding\nDifferent emphases help to better highlight important messages\nA video increases the recognition rate of the learned content\n\n \n\nIMPACT\n\nThe proposed tutorial will help to increase the quality of the assessment process and the decision-making process in Catalyst. Therefore, it has the following positive effects on Cardano:\n\nAdequate assessments and scorings help voters to select the best proposals to get funded\nValuable feedback from community advisors to proposers could increase the quality of future proposals\nThe relative number of flagged assessments will be reduced, reducing also the burden on veteran CAs\n\n \n\n \n\n______ F E A S I B L I T Y _______\n\n \n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n \n\n---TUTORIAL STRUCTURE---\n\nThe videos for the tutorial will be structured in modules according to the different topics and questions that will be addressed. The reason for the modular structure is that it allows changes to be made quickly and without much effort, so that the entire tutorial does not have to be recorded from scratch with each update. In addition, the videos will be hosted in Vimeo, which allows to update the video without having a new URL. Furthermore, the video will contain 'screen sharing' content in combination with voice recordings. That also allows a quick adaptation to updates, as only the content of the related sequence has to be created again in combination with a new voice recording.\n\nIn summary, the structure of the tutorial is designed to respond quickly and cost-effectively to changes that are certain to occur.\n\n \n\n---TUTORIAL CONTENT---\n\nThe content will be based on the official documents and the statements in the Town Hall meetings. Looking ahead, there will be 25 more Town Hall videos in half a year, so I think it will be impossible for newcomers to filter all the relevant information from these videos. We need a source like this tutorial that can be easily and quickly consumed. Therefore, the tutorial will answer the following questions and thus also provide additional value to existing content such as the CA Assessment Guide:\n\nHow to become a CA?\nWhat are the specifics of the challenges?\nHow does the assessment process work?\nHow to assess a proposal? Not only does it say what the criteria are, it will teach you how to use them.\nWhat is the difference between a plan and an idea? I saw many proposals that have presented only an idea but missed to provide an executable plan how to implement the idea. There were also some assessments that could not correctly differentiate between idea and plan.\nWhat is an adequate KPIs and what is the difference between a metric and KPI? Both proposals and assessments show some ignorance on this point\nWhat does a good budget plan look like?\nWhat does an adequate roadmap look like?\nWhat are the potential risks and challenges and how should they be assessed?\nHow much effort is required for an assessment? This question often appeared often Discord / Telegram and shows that some community members had difficulty estimating the effort required for an assessment.\nAnd other topics\n\n \n\n---COMMUNITY---\n\nMy experience: I have helped and coordinated to update the existing CA assessment guide for Fund5. Therefore, I have already collected and received tons of great feedback and I know where the pain points of many community advisors are. I would be happy to continue and expand this effort.\n\nFeedback: There are already some channels (like Discord and Telegram) where many discussions of the community are going on. I will use these channels to interact with the community furthermore, so that a strong and valuable Tutorial will be made.\n\nOwnership: The tutorial will be owned by the community. I will coordinate the creation and the updates (as I did with the CA assessment guide) to ensure its continuing development, but it will always be open for the community to join and participate in this process.\n\nContribution: Valuable contribution from community members in regard to the development of the tutorial will be rewarded, as there will be an extra budget for this part.\n\n \n\n---ACCESS TO TUTORIAL---\n\nThe tutorial can be accessed via the Catalyst community site https://cardanocataly.st\n\nIt will be either directly embedded or accessible via a link. It would also be an option to link to the tutorial directly from the CA assessment guide.\n\nThe video will be published and hosted on Vimeo. The advantages of this platform are:\n\nYou can update the video without changing the URL/stats/comments\nNo ads\nCustomizable player\n\n \n\nBUDGETING\n\nThe budget is divided in two: Content creation and community contribution\n\nContent creation:\n\n350$ for hosting for the videos (Vimeo):\n3.500$ for creating the video (script, editing, voice)\n+ 3.500$ in reserve for updates (= 7x 500$ for each new fund)\n\nCommunity contribution:\n\n3,500$ will be given for valuable contributions to the community for creating and updating the tutorial (i.e. writing script, preparing content, recording)\n\n \n\n \n\n____ A U D I T A B I L I T Y _____\n\n \n\nROADMAP\n\nAs I have helped to modify the CA guideline for Fund 5, I will continue to do so for the coming Funds, to stay updated in the discussion.\n\nThe schedule includes the following milestones:\n\n1 month after voting: The first video will be published.\n3 months after voting: The video series will be complete.\n3-12 months after voting: The video series will be updated for each fund as criteria or challenges are changing. Part of the budget is reserved only for this task.\n\n \n\nKPIs/METRICS\n\nThe goal of the tutorial is that every new community advisor understands the meaning of all the assessment criteria and therefore will provide a valuable and adequate assessment.\n\nThe following metrics help to measure the progress and success of this proposal:\n\nReduce relative number of flagged assessments by 50%\nIncrease relative number of top 10% proposals that get funded\nAverage proposal rating is increasing\nPercentage of CAs who have completed the tutorial is above 80% of all new CAs\n\n \n\nOUTLOOK & CHALLENGES\n\nAs I described in detail above, the tutorial is designed to respond to changes quickly and cost-effectively so that the content provided does not lose its actuality and relevance. The 'community contribution' part also serves to ensure that this effort is not dependent on me alone.\n\n \n\n \n\nLet's work together to increase the quality of Catalyst.\n\nThank you for your votes!","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350904-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nExecutive Summary\nCardano Catalyst is a vibrant community. There are many communication channels and many discussions. It gets harder to understand and harder to get involved as it grows. We aim to develop and improve https://cardanocataly.st as the central place for new and existing community members of Project Catalyst, where they can find up-to-date information about the state of the project, important dates, guides, current projects and a range of tools developed by and for the community.\n\nSites Mission\n\nThe community landing page's mission is to create a hub of information that works to onboard new people, groups and organizations into Project Catalyst as well as a well of tools, resources and talking places to facilitate effective interactions with the project.\n\nDevelopment information\n\nWe have built an MVP version of the site. Fund 4 proposal is aimed at establishing the core processes with a bounty system and building basic design, content and structure.\n\nAs we are reminded every week, things may: break, lack documentation and differ greatly between iterations. Based on early experiences and requests from the community we want to enhance the site with more content and functionalities.\nA dedicated steering team has built and implemented a functional prototype focused on the needs of the community the existing site can be found here: https://cardanocataly.st\n\nIf funding is successful in Fund 4 we will accelerate the work being done by further involving the community with issue identification using Github issue tracking initially. We will further develop our bounty system concept into a process that rewards those community members who solve issues by implementation code updates.\nFurther funding in Fund 5 will allow us to continue an accelerated pace of development to provide an outstanding tool.\n\nRoadmap\n\nThe site is already fully operational and continually being developed.\nThe time frame of this proposal is three months. Future funding will be sort in future funding rounds to develop, experiment and maintain the site.\n\nThe roadmap of the development of the site forms a part of the issue tracking and is continually being updated. For the most up-to-date roadmap of the project please visit the milestones page on the github repo https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io/milestones.\n\nDocument Management: There is a need in the community to ensure that the most up-to-date documents are available to the community. We will create a dedicated 'librarian' role tasked to find, update, catalog community documents and information.\nWe will continue with the development and implementation of community driven development. Where the community can submit requests for fixes, features and content as well as the ability for community members to pick up bounty rewards for solving these issues.\n\nSome key features we are looking at bringing to the site include:\nA wiki site that will allow community driven content that can be maintained by the community\nA focus a localization translations with at least 3 other languages. We have implemented the functionality to do so and have individuals who are able to translate into Arabic, French, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nBringing in support for trackable proposer milestone. https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io/issues/66\nImplementing an automated FAQ\nA system that facilitates payment of feature bounties\nJakob Dickhaut (sapereaude) has requested a weekly write up of Townhall which can be added as bounty each week. This might become an open bounty or could become a part of the community wiki.\n\nBudget\n\nDesign costs: If funded we will engage a team of design experts that can help develop the user flow, UI elements and over all user experience. $3000\nLibrarian Costs: We are looking to fund this role for an experimental 3 months at $500 a week for a total of $6000\nBounties: $10000\nManagement Costs: $2000\nTotal Funds: $21000\n\nThe Team\n\nWe are a group of very active community advisors, Phil with experience in business and design. Phil's personal site is philkhoo.com.

Round over round, pain points start to become clearer as certain projects don't get funded or proposals don't deliver to their promises. At the moment, this data is not readily available on Ideascale.\n\nFor Community Advisors it becomes more complex to track the history of a growing number of different proposals and anticipate known problems of proposals. Currently there is no systematic and data driven approach to increase the quality of proposals. Along with this, proposers can't easily access existing information on the outcome of other proposals to guide their own proposals and prevent any previously made mistakes. Furthermore, it challenges distributed decision making because it limits the voters ability to make well informed decisions.\n\nThe purpose of the Project Catalyst Community Website is to tackle these current problems by providing useful historic data about projects within the Catalyst process for proposers, community advisors and voters. The Project Catalyst Community Website will become the source for education, collaboration and information about the Project Catalyst funding process because it allows all involved parties to get a comprehensive overview of all teams, topics and proposals over time.\n\nWhat project data will be tracked?\nThe following are the starting points for what data can be tracked for a proposal to make it easier for the community to make better distributed decisions.\n\nHow often projects get funded - Currently there is no easy way to track which projects have received funding against the proposals they have submitted. Community members would benefit from seeing how many times a project has been funded.\n\nTotal funding amount - The total funding amount indicates the work that has been already done in the system. It will allow for ranking of the most important projects in the Catalyst process over time, indicate responsibility of certain projects and give an overview where the priorities lie.\n\nLinking projects to their products / websites - Evaluating funded proposals according to their funding and work until a certain point of time will be a benchmark across different proposals. Analyzing past performance will help to allocate future resources in a more efficient, meritocratic way. Linking existing products and websites to projects will be a first step to more transparency about progress.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\nThe proposal aims to provide a single defined part in a community website that provides a central source of information which is constantly updated. It makes it as easy as possible for community members to see the history of different projects and track their success.\nIntegrating project tracking into the website will take ~5 weeks of work. Long term, more features will be added to achieve better distributed decision making within the community.\n\nIf you want to look at all solution ideas that will be integrated in the community website, take a look: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Catalyst-Community-Site-2b0616bedeb94c13a135d565eb883412\n\nDevelopment steps\n\nExtract all the funding data for the previous funds, standardize the data and then add it to the website database\nCreate the single projects associated to grouped proposals to track the overall funding for a project with proposal breakdown\nCreate the backend to allow people to search for projects using funding data and see all proposal data on a given project\nCreate the frontend to show all the funding data for each project on the projects list and project pages\n\nExpected initial implementation launch date ~6th June (+/- 1 week)\n\nAuditability\n\nThe project is currently under development, weekly updates can be found here: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Project-Updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nShort term (3 months): Number of users viewing project lists and project information compared to total participants in Ideascale\n\nLonger term (6-12 months): Tracking interactions between voters, advisors and proposers to determine if the quality of proposals is increasing over time as project and proposal information improves\n\nTeam and collaboration\n\nThe team consists of 3 international people with background in informatics, science, economics, psychology and political science\n\nGeorge L - Web and mobile developer of over 5 years (mainly React, React Native, GraphQL, Serverless and Prisma).

A couple of years ago we had the opportunity to interview Charles Hoskinson at WyoHackathon 2019. This lit a crypto fire in our hearts that burns brighter everyday. Cardano has an amazing ecosystem and culture which we have always wanted to contribute to. We aren't developers or engineers but with Fund 5 opening new categories to be apart of we are ready to put on our boxing gloves and enter the arena!\nWe have decided to name our project the Chilean Leprechaun in honor of the legendary interview we had with Mr. Hoskinson.\nThe idea of and direction we are approaching this campaign from is attracting people exactly like ourselves. Young entrepreneurs and people excited about crypto with a large range of skillsets who aren't aware of the Project Catalyst and bring their attention here.\nOur plan is to create the most eye-catching, cannot-look-away videos. Blast these all over social media and capture the attention of the world! Using a combination of organic reach & paid advertisements, we will create a series of green-screen, bizarre, comedic videos which yield both entertainment value but also ignite fires of excitement into the hearts of the viewers.\nAs a team, we have the exceptional ability of grabbing peoples attention. We have had several viral successes in different styles and on different platforms. Our style is to stand out, provide the viewer with something of value and educate them at the same time. Make them feel elated and laugh so they want to be apart of the community.\nThe infamous Charles interview:\nCOMING SOON!\nOur Plan:\nProduction:\nPre-Production - 1-2 weeks - Storyboard & Script 5-10 videos built to fit on each social media platform, review with the community involved with the project to create the most bulletproof, hilarious and educational videos we can.\nProduction - 1 week - Shoot all of the videos, capturing BTS throughout the process as well. Review footage and rough edits with the community to make videos that communicate the right message yet maintain entertainment value.\nPost-Production - 4-6 weeks - Build all new 3D environments for the video, geared around the virtual world of Catalyst & Cardano. Composite all the footage into the 3D worlds and submit for review through the community and make something that will shock the entire internet!\nMarketing:\nPre-Campaign - Isolate and target the demographic we are going for, isolate the tone & feel of the videos to fit the target demographic. Identify target audiences, build videos targeting either one large audience or multiple more specialized audiences.\nCampaign - Create the Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Youtube Ads, LinkedIn Ads & Tik Tok Ads to blast out these videos everywhere. Use the ad spend as well on growing the channels on each respective platform as to leverage organic reach for future content & projects for Cardano!\nPost-Campaign - With our established presence and analytics from ads we will refine the ads even further narrowing down and making the ads more effective. Using the new established platforms we will continue to grow and make content to build this beautiful ecosystem!\nExamples:\nThis is a video we made for a crypto hardware wallet. This is the style of video we will be blasting to viewers all over the globe:\n\nThis is some of our newer work utilizing 3D environments mixed with green screen footage to create a signature look and feel:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CMr9wZVB6OW/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CNc5Y2XBKXD/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CMZ7zmdheG3/\nOur Viral Work:\nWe know how to grab attention. With 85k followers on Tik Tok in under a year with 1.4m likes and over 10m views. We swept the gaming industry for a week with our Stream Honkers video that captivated the front page of reddit for an entire weekend. Our belief is always that viral and really captivating work has to come from a place of honesty.

Within it, people from all over Latin America and the hispanic world are getting together to collaborate on many initiatives. Some at the regional level, others -like this one- with worldwide potential.\n\n \n\nThere is a wealth of information that already exists within the Spanish Community of Cardano.

Showing the example of how it can change the world and make it a more sustainable and equal place for all. We will be creating informational content on how Cardano can connect to our current sustainable development goals.\nIn addition, sharing projects as they are created and ran on Cardano. Explaining their use cases, and how they can implement Cardano's blockchain technologies and partnerships. To interview/publicize, showing how people in the world are implementing these technologies into their communities and ecosystems. This will help increase the network's ability to make the world a more sustainable place. In addition, with creating outreach for the people unsure what this technology is, and how they may be able to incorporate it into their business or corporation.\n\n \n\nGoals:\n\n \n\n- Create informational content, exploring how Cardano can make the world more sustainable or help work towards completing current (SDGs).\n- Create a network exploring and promoting current projects running on Cardano, that will help make strides towards a sustainable world.\n- Encourage other members from outside the community to come in and implement their sustainable projects on or working with Cardano's blockchain technology.\n\n \n\nCreate a sustainable ADA Deck:\nThe goal of the Sustainable ADA deck is to get the attention of people from all over the world of all ages and demographics. The info in the deck will be quick and to the point. This is so we can express and explore connections with Cardano and sustainability while being able to teach and execute valuable information onto the community in an effective way. This allows someone to gain powerful value in a quick and timely manner. The reason for this is because people don't have 10-30 minutes to learn, or they just don't take the time to. This will allow those people to find a connection with a least one of our resource cards and find a need to look at others. Leading to a ripple effect of knowledge.\n\n \n\nConnect with people in the community creating the Sustainable ADA Network:\n- This will be a network of teachers and project leaders who have implemented or are trying to implement a Sustainable project on Cardano and areas where these projects can be started and promoted.\n\n \n\nSustainable ADA Educational resources:\n- Creating courses for the youth and all to help explain the connection Cardano has with sustainability and showing the connections with specific SDGs.\n\n \n\nSustainable ADA Network:\n- A place for people to connect with others, and learn how to implement their ideas onto the Cardano blockchain with their business or use cases.\n\n \n\nWhen someone asked what we want/desire to do?\n\n \n\n\"This organization Sustainable ADA would be an educator and activist for the Cardano community and Ecosystem. An idea we had was to put a large focus on Financial Identity at the beginning, and how this is a key component that will lead into the rest of our SDGs. Focusing on how this can create equality, sustainable economies, and a better environment.\nLeading from this by taking a deep dive into what a Cardano Stakeholder is and how this ecosystem is focused on Stakeholders, not a shareholder or one who holds lots of ADA. Also, a second connection to our SDGs with current technologies created for or running on the Cardano blockchain. An example of this would be expressing the importance of improvements to agriculture systems/supply chain efficiency; the focus of tracking and eliminating counterfeit goods in the retail system; help solve healthcare issues with fake medicine and a financial loss. These are just a few examples of direct changes Cardano is making.\nSome SDGs' that connect right away and stem off of financial identity are #1 No poverty, #8 Economic Growth, #9 Industry innovation, and infostructure, #10 Reduce inequality, #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, #12 Consumption and Production. These are direct areas we see Cardano making change, and the goal is to express how this change can be made. Also, Cardano helps chip away at other SDGs. This is so we can educate the community and our outer community. To take a strong look at Cardano and as more projects and Dapps are deployed on the Network share them with the community.

We will demonstrate exactly how to get registered and submit proposals, as well as the community interaction tools on the Project Catalyst website and related Discord channels.\n\nThe Catalyst funding will show the community tangible proof of the positive outcomes possible from a good idea coupled with hard work and dedication.\n\nYou can see from the photos attached below, and the fact that I met my first teammate, Mearaf, at IceAddis, that I am already doing this, and it's working! However, we need more time to be able to reach more people and to show them how easy it is to get involved. I also want to expand beyond just IceAddis. There are several disparate developer communities in Ethiopia, and with a little funding we can reach all of them!\n\nUPDATE April 19, 2021: Our early efforts are already paying off, and I have now expanded my team to include Nebiyou and Nathan, both of whom had never been to IceAddis previously. We are already building bridges and connecting the various tech niches in Addis Ababa!\n\nMeasures of success\n\nNumber of proposals in F7 and F8 which list one our team members as the referrer or co-submitter\nGoal: 3 or more successful proposals across F7 and F8, directly inspired by our campaign\nAfter 3 months, we should see results from F6, and know if our early efforts were successful (based on the number of successful proposals directly inspired by our campaign)\nAfter 6 months, we will see the results from F7.\nAfter 9 months we will see the results from F8.\nAfter 12 months, we will integrate this marketing campaign into one of our successful partner projects.\n\n \n\nDocumentation Plan\n\nShare photos of our activities (passing out flyers, informal discussions) on social media\nCapture video of our formal presentations and share them on YouTube\n\n \n\nTarget Launch Date: April 29, 2021\n\nWe are now planning our first event for April 29: Watch Party for the Cardano Africa event!\nDetails are TBD, but this will likely be held at IceAddis, thanks to Mearaf's existing connections there\nThe Cardano Africa show starts at 19:30 Addis Ababa time on Thursday, April 29\n\nNote this proposal effort is kicking off before voting and funding will happen for F5, because we are committed to engaging the local community prior to F6, and we feel the Cardano Africa event is a perfect kick off for our efforts here in Ethiopia.\n\n \n\nBudget (updated to reduce expense estimates)\n\nSocial media ads: $750\nPrinting posters and flyers: $400\nTraditional media: $300\nMeetup Pro: $120\nPart-time salaries: $3000","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351941-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nProblem\n\n4 million startups were established in 2020\nThere are only 7000 crypto projects available\nYou can count the ones on Cardano with your hands\nMany entrepreneurs are not yet aware about blockchain / Cardano / Catalyst.\n\nSolution\n\nA curated newsletter facilitates access to information about Cardano in general and Project Catalyst in particular.\nReaders will gain insights into the value of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem and learn about opportunities, projects and processes at Catalyst.\n\nSuccess metric\n\n10 submitted proposals coming from outside the Cardano ecosystem\n(#CardanoCatalystNewsletter or #CCnews mentioned in Catalyst proposals) within the first 3 months\n12 newsletters send out in 3 months\n50.000 subscribers after 3 months\n\nOutlook\n\nenough feedback and input to apply for additional 3 months funding.\n100.000 subscribers and 50 proposals after 6 months\n1.000.000 subscribers and 1000 proposals after 12 months\n\n \n\nCompetition\n\nAccelerators, incubators, VCs, and business angel clubs provide funding and support for startups.\nWe have several sources to get information about Cardano: Newsletters/blogs/YouTube channels, Cardano fans on Twitter, …\nWe have very few sources about Catalyst.\nIt takes a lot of time to track all activities and except the relevant ones.\nThere is no Cardano Catalyst Newsletter available.\n\n \n\nTarget group\nTech-savvy entrepreneurs who are looking for (additional) funding, want to build a powerful team with Cardano experts, and want to get valuable feedback from the community.\n\nMarket size\n\nPotentially all entrepreneurs who want to change the world and see blockchain as opportunity.\n\nTeam\n\nWave 1: me (to start small)\nWave 2: me + 1-3 volunteers from the Community\nWave 3: Editors from the Community (I can but must no longer be part of the team)\n\n \n\nGrowth potential\n\nWave 1: F5 - think big, start small (covered with this F5 proposal)\nWave 2: F7 - improve + start decentralisation\nWave 3: F9 - full decentralisation + scale\n\n \n\nTimeline & work break down\nWeek 1: (starting in the next week after official approval)\n\norganise email address from Cardano Foundation (preferred), IOG or emurgo.

This proposal addresses this challenge directly by offering to launch an Online Marketing Campaign. An Online Marketing Campaign is a fast and effective way to raise awareness about the promoted product (in this case Catalyst).\n\nHow will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?\n\nCurrently Catalyst has about 20k members on Ideascale. The goal is to grow to 100k members to the end of 2021 (see town hall video of April 21st). This campaign is going to reach +500k views and +25k clicks and interactions. Therefore, this campaign will have a huge impact in reaching the set goals and will help our community to grow not only in size but also in quality, because the campaign will also support entrepreneurs to create successful proposals (see more details below).\n\nOutlook and future challenges?\n\nThis proposal includes the possibility to apply for further funding in the future. Since the content (video and landing page) is already created then, the funds can be used more efficiently to reach the set goals in community growth and engaged entrepreneurs.\n\n______ F E A S I B L I T Y _______\n\nBUILDING A SUCCESSFUL ONLINE MARKETING CAMPAIGN\n\nA successful online marketing campaign consists of two key elements:\n\n1. increase awareness through great content\n\n2. a strong call-to-action plan\n\nGreat content is the foundation of any online campaign. But the reach and therefore the success of the campaign depends mainly on the way in which the content is implemented and whether the attention can be turned into call-to-action. Therefore, the creation of content, the generation of traffic and the call-to-action part must be linked together.\n\n1) Define the goals of the campaign:\n\nMain goal:\n\nIncrease the number of funded proposals submitted by entrepreneurs\nIncrease awareness about Catalyst among blockchain industry\n\nSecondary goal:\n\ngetting projects from other blockchains moving to Cardano\n\n2) Define the target group:\n\nThis second step is very important because you need a different approach to reach a developer or an entrepreneur. And it is also crucial to consider the background of the entrepreneur. In conclusion, this campaign targets two types of entrepreneurs:\n\nThe first one already is involved in the blockchain industry but outside of Cardano.\nThe second one has a business or business idea that will benefit from using a blockchain system like Cardano.\n\n3) How do we reach the target group with efficient cost?\n\nThis campaign will use two major channels to reach the target group:\n\nYouTube Ads\nGoogle Display Ads\n\nBoth channels reach 90% of internet users worldwide and YouTube in particular has a very active \"crypto\" community. The given options for setting a campaign on these channels enable to effectively reach the target group. Of course, the ads will be shown next to blockchain-related content. A further advantage of this channels is the low cost-per-click ratio. And thanks to real-time tracking, adjustments can be made at any time.\n\nPaid ad vs. organic search strategy:\n\nGreat content will eventually be found organically, but you should obviously do everything you can to make sure your video gets the attention it deserves. That's why a paid ad strategy is important to get the reach we want.\n\n4) How to convert the traffic into meaningful participation on Catalyst?\n\nThe heart of the campaign will be a new created landing page. The video and display ads will direct the user to this website.\n\nIn conclusion, the website will support the campaign in two ways:\n\nFirst, the landing page contains a strong call-to-action plan by encouraging entrepreneurs to propose their ideas on Catalyst and also providing assistance to do so successfully.\nSecond, the landing page will give the opportunity to measure analyze the traffic which is important to run a campaign successfully.\n\n5) What content will be created?\n\nLanding page\n\nAs described in 4)\nIn addition to the YouTube and Display Ads, the landing page will contain keyword-optimized content to generate organic traffic via Google Search. Since it takes time to improve visibility in Google Search, the creation of the website has already started.\nThe URL for the landing page will be: www.catalyst-fund.io\nThe name of this site is good to use for SEO as it covers the most related search results to this fund.\nThis creation of the landing page also includes the creation of the banners for Google Display Ads, as they will have the same design.\n\nAnimated commercial video\n\nAnimated videos are great for making complex content easy to understand. And a well-presented video increases the recognition of the message. The created video will explain why and how a business will benefit from Cardano in general and from Catalyst in particular.\n\nThe video will be approx. 45 seconds long. In my experience a longer video will not increase interaction. Since the first 5-10 seconds are of great importance for advertising videos on the internet, I will create two different start sequences to see which one is more successful. This increases the probability of a successful campaign. The video will be presented on the landing page and on YouTube as ´Display Ads' and 'In-Stream Ads'.\n\nWhat will be the approach to reach the target group and reach the set goals?\n\nThe campaign will present Catalyst as the door to Cardano.\nThe campaign slogan will probably: \"Get your blockchain project funded\"\nThe key message will be: Up to 15M$ every 6 weeks for different challenges\n\n6) What is the requirement for the content (video and landing page)?\n\nTo ensure that the created content is relevant and helpful for the target group, the campaign takes the following aspects into account:\n\n\"Make sure that technical knowledge is not an entry barrier to Cardano\"\n\nThe main focus of the Cardano website is on technical and philosophical aspects. Personally, I like it, but if you don't have a background in IT, it's sometimes difficult to get the point.\n\n\"Relevant information must be easily accessible\"\n\nThe Cardano website is full of helpful information, but sometimes it may take persistence to find the relevant information. Therefore, the landing page summarizes specific content for entrepreneurs.\n\nCOLLABORATION\n\nI also encourage the community to contact me if there are other use-cases for the video.\nIn addition, we as a community can share (post/retweet) the created video on other social media channels, to expand the impact of this campaign. Especially I mean here Twitter, because there is a very active crypto community. I didn't choose Twitter for a paid ad strategy because it is much more expensive (cost-per-click >5$) than Display/YouTube ads and much harder to plan (there are high variations from my experience).\nOn the landing page of this campaign there will be the possibility to sign up for a newsletter, which informs about current dates and success stories in Catalyst. For this purpose, I will also partner with the proposal Cardano Catalyst Newsletter (in case both get funded) to share our reach and content.\n\nTEAM\n\nDominik (proposer): strategy, video script, campaign management (see link above)\nVera: landing page, design, campaign management https://www.linkedin.com/in/vera-stumpp-436b971b1/\nThomas: video creation (effects, animation) https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszuchtriegel/\nMax: video creation (script, cut, edit, sound) https://mxvisualarts.com/\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nAs mentioned earlier, content creation is the easiest part of a campaign. However, reaching the right audience is difficult and needs to be carefully built up. It is very easy to waste money on online ads (especially on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, where the cost-per-click ratio can be very high without getting the desired result). Because of this, this campaign starts with YouTube and Google Display Ads, where costs and results are easier to manage. In addition, I will partner with Vera to ensure the success of the campaign. Together we will constantly evaluate and adjust the settings of the campaign based on the impact of all the actions we have taken.\n\nBUDGET\n\nThe budget is divided in two parts: content creation and advertisement\n\nContent creation: 7.900$\n\nLanding page (incl. content, design, hosting, SEO, display banner): 2.500$\nAnimated commercial video (incl. script, effects, editing, cutting, voice, sound): 5.400$\n\nAdvertisement for 60 Days: 20.000$\n\n300 $ per day for YouTube Ads and Google Display Ads = 18.000$\nThe allocation is not fixed and will depend on the success of each channel\nCampaign Management (tracking and adjustments): 2h per Day for 60 Days: 2000$\n\nBudget explanation:\n\nCost-Per-Click calculation: YouTube & display ads: 18.000$ = 18.000 clicks = 1$ per click\n\nI have chosen the goals (see metrics below) carefully and from my experience a cost-per-click ratio of 1$ per-click is realistic. Of course, there is a little uncertainty and the ratio usually changes a bit from week to week. One week you might pay 70 cents, the next week maybe 1,40$ per click. This is why it is important to constantly monitor the progress and always choose a campaign setting where the ratio is within the limits. Therefore, it is necessary to have a benchmark (here it is the 1$ per-click ratio) for a campaign to reach the set goals.\n\nThe main part of the budget will go to the team for content creation and campaign management and to third parties for ad payments. The costs for campaign management are at 10% of the media budget, which is far below industry average (20-30%). I personally will have a financial benefit from this proposal when I reach the goal of 15 successful referrals afterwards.\n\n******__ A U D I T A B I L I T Y _____\n\nROADMAP\n\nThe end of the voting for Fund5 is expected to be in June. We will be fully prepared to this date, so that we can start to produce the video right away within one month. After that, the campaign will run for 60 Days. The landing page should be ready for the start of the Fund6 submission phase. We will create this site regardless of the voting result. If the timetable will change like in Fund4, the roadmap will be adjusted.\n\nOur schedule includes the following milestones:\n\n1 month after voting: content is created\n3 months after voting: campaign has been running successfully\n3-12 months after voting: In the months following the campaign, the intended 15 referrals will be reached (ideally already after 6 months)\n\nMETRICS & KPIs\n\nIt's not possible to measure all the triggered engagement on Catalyst through this campaign, therefore, I have chosen related indicators to measure the success of this campaign:\n\nMain goal:\n\nSuccessful funded proposals: 15 (measured as referral)\n\nMedia coverage:\n\nTotal views of ads: min. 500.000\nTotal clicks: min. 20.000\nLanding page visitors: min. 25.000\nLanding page interactions: min. 250 (measured as subscription or using contact form)\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe idea behind building this campaign is to lay a foundation (with the landing page and commercial video) that could be used for further campaigns. As soon as I have the first data of the success of this campaign, I will apply for another funding to extend the campaign for additional weeks. I will also test the content on different channels and then use the results and insights in the next funding rounds so that we can achieve the desired growth for Catalyst as quickly as possible.\n\n \n\n \n\nLet's grow together and thus positively influence the development of Cardano.\n\nThank you for your votes!\n\n.\n\n.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350844-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nProject Catalyst Community Website - Addressing the Challenge\n\nThe current Project Catalyst process is lacking a platform to match potential collaborators and proposers which makes it more time consuming to effectively start new collaborations\n\nAt the moment, proposers that need a team have to manually search for individuals themselves and people who want to collaborate have to contact individual proposers. This increases the barrier for new entrepreneurs to engage in collaborations on IdeaScale due to a lack of awareness of who is looking to collaborate and what skills and services those people could bring to the proposals.\n\nA list that encompasses all participants open for collaboration would solve this problem by providing a central place for both collaborators and proposers to get in contact. The use of a collaborator list will be a useful tool for all future proposal outreach ideas and campaigns. Now those campaigns can direct people to sign up to a collaborator list if they don't have an idea or team to work with - which will be the majority of people who are new to the space. The list of collaborators will help give the community an increased chance to come together and make sure the right talent is available for new projects.\n\nBesides providing a collaborators list, the Project Catalyst Community Website aims to become the source for education, collaboration and relevant information about the Project Catalyst funding process.\n\nHow will the collaborators list look?\n\nA collaborator list is a collection of people who are looking to contribute to Project Catalyst proposals. The list will let people share what skills and services they can offer and options for people to contact them. It will contain four different criteria that will allow for an efficient filtering of collaborators:\n\nCommunity role (e.g. Community advisor, stake pool operator, proposer)\nSkills (e.g. Haskell)\nServices (e.g. Web development)\nAvailable for collaboration (whether or not a person is available to collaborate)\n\nOver time and in future funding rounds the collaborators list will get more complex and granular for better matching processes. Having a list of potential collaborators will make it as easy as possible for new ideas and teams to form which should help to a) integrate new entrepreneurs easier into the process and b) improve the amount of quality proposals going through the funding process.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nThe proposal aims to provide a single defined part in a community website that provides a central source of information which is constantly updated.\n\nIntegrating a collaborators list into the website will take ~7 weeks. Long term, more features will be added to better engage with the community of entrepreneurs.\n\nIf you want to look at all solution ideas that will be integrated in the community website, take a look: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Catalyst-Community-Site-2b0616bedeb94c13a135d565eb883412\n\nDevelopment steps\n\nDefine a base set of skills identifiers to use on profiles and open source on a Github project to allow for maximum collaboration\nCreate the data structures for the users and skill identifiers and setup a database\nCreate a backend to allow people to signup and update their profiles, get the skills list and also get a list of collaborators\nCreate the frontend pages for signup / login, profile management, collaborator list and collaborator profile pages.\n\nExpected initial implementation launch date is ~9th May (+/- 1 week)\n\nAuditability:\n\nThe project is currently under development, weekly updates can be found here: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Project-Updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nShort term (3 months): Number of users using the collaborators list\n\nLonger term (6-12 months): Tracking interactions between collaborators to determine if more collaborations are fostered through the collaboration list\n\nTeam and collaboration\n\nThe team consists of 3 international people with background in informatics, science, economics, psychology and political science\n\nGeorge L - Web and mobile developer of over 5 years (mainly React, React Native, GraphQL, Serverless and Prisma).

By openly discussing barriers to entry, we make space to form new relationships, to elucidate problem statements, and for new proposals to emerge. The results of this process will vary: some people will discover that they have an exciting proposal to write, others will gain the confidence to be Community Advisors, and others will find teams in need of their unique contributions.\n\n \n\nAt the root of this proposal is my belief that there will never be \"one right way\" to onboard people to Catalyst. I am befuddled by one of the Guiding Questions for this challenge: \"How can we provide a central source of constantly updated information in different formats(text, video, p2p)?\" How quickly we seek to re-centralize, even as the work of decentralizing is in its infancy! The entire purpose of distributed, decentralized systems is that there are many onramps and access points for engagement. We should celebrate this, and continuously experiment in expanding the patchwork of solutions over time.\n\n \n\nSo while I am thrilled to see the ongoing development of documentation and asynchronous resources that support people to understand and eventually to engage in the Catalyst process, I also know that no matter how perfect the documentation gets, some people won't read it. No matter how clearly the host of Catalyst Town Hall shares the instructions for how to participate, some people will need to hear it differently. This is a feature of democracy, not a bug.\n\n \n\nMany people still need to talk through their ideas, ask questions in a smaller setting than Town Hall, and begin to feel the sense of community that is essential to Catalyst. Many people remain \"lurkers\" because they are yet to recognize the value of what they can contribute - I know what this feels like, because I remained a Cardano lurker for much longer than I should have.\n\n \n\nI am proposing to pilot weekly \"Catalyst Skeptics Workshops\". If funded, over the next two Catalyst rounds, I will host these sessions for newcomers to Catalyst who need to talk about warts before they're ready to talk about potential. I worked for 11 years as a high school Algebra teacher - I know how to channel negative vibes into curiosity and engagement.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the immediate outcomes of this work, I will share the results of these workshops with the intention of creating a template that other people can use.\n\n \n\n--- Definitions of success ---\n\n3 months: a minimum of 12 \"Catalyst Skeptics\" will join in each of the next two Catalyst funding rounds (we are preliminarily targeting Funds 7 and 8, and will adjust if necessary according to revised Catalyst timelines). Skeptics will define barriers to entry in Catalyst, and through weekly meetups and asynchronous support, will be invited to craft solutions to the problems they identify.\n6 months: solutions crafted through our Catalyst Skeptics program will be refined into viable Catalyst proposals.\n12 months: Alumni of Catalyst Skeptics will pay it forward by continuing to onboard new newcomers to Catalyst Funds 15 and beyond.\n\n \n\n \n\n--- About the Proposer ---\nI have been participating in Catalyst since Fund 1, with winning proposals in Funds 1 and 2 (and hopefully by the time you vote on this, Fund 4). I have been a careful observer of the Catalyst process and the various points of view of participants. This proposal is my direct response to these observations, and like I note above, a product of my hopes that our community can make more than a buzzword of \"decentralization\".\n\n \n\n--- Public launch date ---\n23 June 2021, pending Catalyst timelines. (This project will officially launch at the start of the first Catalyst round after votes are tallied for Fund 5.)\n\n \n\n--- Budget ---\n\nProject leader: $6000 for 12 weeks of work over the course of two funding rounds\nProject support: $3500 to incentivize project support, including social media presence and community reporting\nWeb hosting & subscription services (tbd): $500\n\n--- Q&A ---\n\nCan you speak about how people would find your weekly courses?\nI will craft an invitation to be shared at Town Hall, and will ask for the opportunity to present for a few minutes at the first Town Hall of each of the two funding rounds. I will create a landing page at gimbalabs.com, and I will ask the maintainers of the Cardano Catalyst Community Site to post about this opportunity ( If necessary, I can also create a dedicated URL for this project). Each will link to a sign up form, and we will publish a mailing list for anyone who cannot attend the meetings in real time.\nCan you outline one of the typical workshops just in general?\nEach workshop will focus on relationships first. Attendees will have the chance to share their questions and concerns about Catalyst, we will identify common threads, and we will proceed to clearly define action steps for each attendee.\nWould you expect others from the community to join you when conducting the workshops?\nAll will be welcome, but I will seek to maximize \"air time\" for newcomers to Catalyst. Veterans of our community will be encouraged to copy and iterate on this idea.\nWould this be the same workshop each week for two months (entry level each week) or gradually increasing content?\nThe sequence of workshops will be similar for each funding round, likely with some revisions from Fund 7 to Fund 8. The content will change from week to week, following the Catalyst process and defining actionable steps that participants can take.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352744-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352612-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nPurpose of this Proposal/Address Challenge Question\nWADA (West Africa Decentralized Alliance) is requesting 11K USD to leverage its partnership with the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) to reach and integrate at least 200 French and English speaking West African Students into Project Catalyst within 6 months.

Within it, people from all over Latin America and the Hispanic world are getting together to collaborate on many initiatives like this one.\n\n \n\nOne of the most important objectives we have, is to provide a safe space for people to self-govern and solve real world problems. In order to do so, it is vital to understand how a decentralized funding process like that of Project Catalyst works. But, with the information we currently have available in Spanish, it is very unlikely for the Latin American Community to achieve this goal. Regardless of your English level, it's always easier to learn and communicate in your native language.\n\n \n\nWe believe that ALDEA can both help and encourage people to join this growing ecosystem, by providing the tools they need to learn about Catalyst. This is a great opportunity for the region to further develop these new and collaborative ways of working as a decentralized society.\n\n \n\nIf you want to know more about ALDEA you can join our Discord Server in https://discord.com/invite/KkZjH5Tzkn\n\n \n\nHow will ALDEA help?\nAt the moment, Project Catalyst offers these roles for people who want to participate:\n\nProposer\nTeam Member\nCommunity Advisor\nVoter\n\nProposers will benefit from networking with like-minded people, receive language support, find team members, or get feedback from the community.\n\n \n\nTeam Members can grow a reputation and a profile within the ecosystem and find proposals to work on.\n\n \n\nCommunity Advisors can stay up-to-date with everything relevant to their roles and the different funds.\n\n \n\nVoters will receive translated information on different initiatives and proposals, allowing them to fully understand their impact and therefore better exercising their voting rights.\n\n \n\nBy doing all this, ALDEA is encouraging meaningful participation from the Spanish and Latin American communities.\n\n \n\nHow will ALDEA achieve this?\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, we have divided the scope of the project in two different parts:\n\n \n\nShort-Term Goals\nDiscord Server (already up and running) for Proposers, Team Members and Community Advisors to collaborate, discuss ideas and proposals, share insights and make teams. Translations of Proposals & production of diverse guides for different users that want to participate or learn about Project Catalyst.\n\n \n\nLong-Term Goals\nALDEA will build a \"Talents Board\" where Proposers can search for the best fit for their teams. The Board will have information about the profile of the person and history about previous proposals or bounties they collaborated with. This way, both Proposers and Team Members will grow a reputation within Project Catalyst and the Community, for everyone's benefit.\n\n \n\nPhase 1: Discord, Landing Page & Translations\n\nDiscord Server - done\nUpgrade Discord Server with bots, notifications, channels, polls, calendars and more support for the Community.\nLanding Page - ongoing (an MVP will be released shortly)\nTranslation Service - a translation of the most important Proposals will be shared with the Community prior to each Governance Phase.\nGuides will be produced and maintained according to Project Catalyst updates and changes.\n\nPhase 2: Talents Board\n\nLanding Page becomes a Platform.\nUser registration with different roles (Proposer or Team Member)\nComplete profile with personal information, previous experience and skills\nProposers can publish their project and the potential skills they need\nTeam Members can tag themselves as \"seeking opportunities\" or can apply for open positions.\n\nPhase 2 is complementary to Phase 1: the Discord Server and the Translation Service will go on after Phase 2 is complete.\n\n \n\nKPIs\nWe will measure the success of the Proposal and the engagement of the Community with it using the following metrics:\n\n \n\nNumber of active Proposers in Discord Server.\nNumber of ALDEA Community Proposals that made it to Project Catalyst.\n% of ALDEA Community Proposals that got funded in Project Catalyst.\nAverage rating of the ALDEA Community Proposals in Project Catalyst.\nNumber of active Team Members in Discord Server.\nNumber of active Community Advisors in Discord Server.\nNumber of Users registered on ALDEA Catalyst platform.\nNumber of Users promoting themselves in the Talents Board.\nNumber of matches between Proposers and Talents using Talents Board.\n\n \n\nBudget\nWe are asking for funds for Phase 1 only, with a 6 months horizon.\n\n \n\nOur budget includes the following:\n\n \n\nGrow the Discord Server with bots, channels, polls, calendars and support for Proposers, Team Members, Community Advisors and Voters. We estimate 10 hours of work each month for these tasks.\nTranslation (and easy-to-understand explanation) of \"Most Popular\" Proposals from each Challenge of all Funds, prior to the Governance Phase. We will translate 30 Proposals from each Fund (for the next 6 Funds). We estimate 1 hour to translate each Proposal and 1 more hour to write a good review about it.\nDevelopment of a Website with information about Project Catalyst, Guides, Calendar with important dates, translations of most important proposals from each fund. The site will be running for 6 months and we are also including in our budget the necessary work to keep it up-to-date with the latest Catalyst news and information about each Proposal.\nHosting Infrastructure\n\n \n\nFunds Detail\n\n6 months period\nUSD 20 hourly rate\n\n \n\nTranslation of Proposals + Review : 360 hours -> USD 7200\nDiscord Upgrades & Maintenance: 60 hours -> USD 1200\nWebsite Development, Update & Maintenance: 25 hours -> USD 500\nHosting -> USD 180\n\nTOTAL: USD 9080.-\n\nFunds for Phase 2 will be asked in a future Proposal, after the team is comfortable with the progress of Phase 1 and feels it is the right time to take one step further in the development of ALDEA Catalyst.\n\n \n\nProbably after Phase 2 (and of course once ALDEA becomes a fully operating DAO) we will need an allocation from its Treasury to run all these Community related projects (that would be after Smart Contracts are available in Cardano). This way ALDEA Catalyst will become a self-sufficient project.\n\nCHECKLIST\n\nHow my proposal impacts the challenge metrics & How I address the challenge question?\n\nThis challenge and its metrics is about increasing participation in Catalyst among the various roles and ways to do so. We understand that by building this platform, we are doing exactly that.\n\nDefinition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months.\n\nThis is explained in greater detail in the different sections above.\n\nThe 3 months time frame aligns with our short-term goals, where we expect to already have meaningful participation in the Discord channels, discussing new proposals and getting together to form new teams.\n\nBy the 6 months, we'll be completing phase 1 with a working site including translated proposals, town hall updates, training materials and guides to participate in Project Catalyst.\n\nThe 12 months time frame aligns with the completion of our phase 2, bringing the Talents Board and user registration to the platform, where proposers will be able to find members to build stronger teams and people to find new opportunities.\n\nIncluded identifying information about all proposers.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/matias-falcone/\nhttps://www.falconstakepool.com/\nhttps://www.aldea-dao.org/about-eng.html\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mauro-hernan-falcone/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/eramallo/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-lanfranchi/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-falcone-682726109/\n\nDefined expected public launch date.\n\nThe MVP will be live by May 31st in preparation for Fund5 Governance Phase. Subsequent updates and improvements will be made as outlined in our goals and phases above, within the 3 to 6 months period for phase 1 and 6 to 12 for phase 2.\n\nCore Team\n\nWith 70+ years of combined IT experience in software development and digital transformation across a variety of industries, our core team of 6 people includes Technical Leads, Business Analysts, Product Wizards, UX Designers, Entrepreneurs, Business Owners, and Foreing Trade and Banking Analysts.\n\n \n\nThis combined experience brings all sorts of skills and knowledge to the table. These include technical and business-oriented skills, but above all, it brings creative thinking, problem-solving, resiliency, experience in working for global and diverse teams remotely among different languages and cultures, reporting to stakeholders, and the ability to do all this while having fun!\n\n \n\nWe are lucky to already have the support of several Stakepool Operators from the region, senior Cardano enthusiasts and key members of our community, acting in an advisory and promoter capacity, with whom we meet regularly and are already essential members of ALDEA.\n\n \n\nThis proposal is backed by ALDEA (the Latin America DAO - https://aldea-dao.org)) and its Community.\n\n \n\nPropuesta en Español: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTqZNuNIfaq0ebGQNCkwZeAk8UtUPaoheeDoiKaBJmM/edit\n\n \n\nRelated Proposal from Fund4: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/ALDEA-the-Latin-America-DAO/341349-48088","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352422-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nI already have a channel with more than 15,000 followers.\nFor now only I am producing content, but with the money received I intend to pay some people to help me.\n\n \n\nThe budget will be divided into two parts:\n\n1 part - content creation\n\nThe idea is to produce content about the differentiation of the cardan project compared to the others, with the following themes:\n\n \n\n1- Tutorials explaining how to buy ADA,\n2- tutorials teaching how to place to do staking in DAEDALUS\n3- Tutorials teaching about concepts of the cardan ecosystem: blockchain, crypto, NFT, Catalyst, smart contracts, among other things.\n4 - Make videos in Portuguese for Brazilians to follow the main news and information about the cardano project\nWith the money received, I will buy some equipment to create videos with better quality and make lives. The idea is to post at least one content about Cardano every week. By gradually explaining the entire ecosystem, in a progressive, didactic way, showing opportunities to undertake, we will achieve a minimum average of 1,000 views in each content produced.\nGood content is the foundation of any online campaign. But the reach and therefore the success of the campaign depends mainly on how the content is implemented. Therefore, content creation and traffic generation must be interconnected.\n\n \n\n2 part - advertising\n\nGOAL:\n\nMain: increase the number of investors in ADA, and consequently of delegations in the Brazilian Pool \"CARDS\".\nSecondary: Contribute to other blockchains' projects to migrate to Cardano and encourage people to use the cardan ecosystem by participating as project creators in catalyst, creating NFT, among other things\n\n \n\nAPPROXIMATION:\nThe campaign will present DAEDALUS as the gateway to Cardano.\nThe campaign's slogan could be: \"Have a passive income, investing in ADA\"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351093-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350982-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350869-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nThere are two ways of increasing meaningful participation from proposers, advisors, and voters in Catalyst:\n\n• By increasing believe in philosophy and mission of Cardano of existing ADA holders\n\n• By increasing number of ADA holders\n\nBoth points could be easily improved by engaging non-English-speaking people. There is not much difficulty in using Idea scale website with help of Google translate if there is desire to participate. Much harder is to invoke desire. For English speaking public there is great engaging and marketing channel – Charles Hoskinson YouTube video blog. It is most popular YouTube channel about Cardano, with 147 thousand subscribers and 27-180 thousand views for each video in one week. But there are no active YouTube channels about Cardano in other languages. I have found only one non-English YouTube channel, it is on Spanish (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_fc4Qy1qVIO7A0pqU5AoQ) and posts mainly highlights, not full videos. According to Wikipedia English speaks only 17% of the world. We could greatly improve participation in Catalyst by translating Charles's videos in different languages.\n\nHere I propose to translate Charles Hoskinson videos to Russian language, because I am native speaker of it. Russian speaks 258 million people, so we could increase overall number of views by up to 19% (English speaks 1 348 million people, 258/1348 = 0.19).\n\nBy increasing number of Charles's views, we are accordingly increasing Catalyst participation.\n\nIt would take one year to achieve full maturity of Russian channel. Currently minimal number of views for one Charles's video is 27 000 during 1st week of issuing. So, we could set next goals for this proposal:\n\n1 month – 270 views in Russian during 1st week of issuing (+1% participation)\n\n3 months – 540 views in Russian during 1st week of issuing (+2% participation)\n\n6 months – 1350 views in Russian during 1st week of issuing (+5% participation)\n\n12 months – 5130 views in Russian during 1st week of issuing (+19% participation, maximum maturity of video channel)\n\nI propose to fund the first 3 months of translation to be able to assess goal achievement during 1st month and make decision for continue during Fund7 campaign without interrupting channel's operation.\n\nCharles Hoskinson produced roughly 100 hours of videos in 2020, it makes 25 hours per 3 months. Cost of transcription, translation, dubbing and video editing in Russian for 1 hour is roughly 260 USD, so 3 months of translation would cost 6 500 USD.\n\nAfter each episode from Charles I will create mini tenders on site freelancehunt.com for the best cost proposition separately for transcription/translation and for dubbing. Any remaining funds would be spent on translation of Charles Hoskinson's interviews.\n\nWe could half the cost by making only Russian subtitles, but marketing effectiveness would be greatly decreased. There is huge competition for viewer attention. YouTube videos now are very sophisticated.\n\nThe ways to promote translated videos are:\n\n• By publishing them on major Russian cryptocurrency forums (forum.bits.media, ttrcoin.com/forums/)\n\n• By word-of-mouth marketing through Russian Cardano telegram channel, that has now 1156 participants. Each participant accordingly would spread the videos by own social media (Facebook, VK, Twitter).","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350835-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350704-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nProject Catalyst Community Website - Addressing the Challenge\n\nIn the current Project Catalyst process, the number of different proposals related to the same team or topic grows constantly. This makes the funding process more challenging because it increases the time to find similar proposals for a given topic and for connecting people to project teams.\n\nFor newcomers the whole process is overwhelming because of the amount that needs to be learnt upfront. Additionally there are an increasing number of proposals to read and understand. This causes increased management effort for proposers and community advisors to improve collaboration and prevent redundancies. Furthermore, it prevents meaningful participation by voters that are interested in specific topics.\n\nThe purpose of the Project Catalyst Community Website is to tackle these current problems within the Catalyst process for proposers, community advisors and voters. The Project Catalyst Community Website will become the source for education, collaboration and information about the Project Catalyst funding process that will allow all involved parties to get a comprehensive overview of all teams, topics and proposals over time.\n\nHow will proposal data be improved?\n\nThe following are the starting points for adding more information to a proposal that will make it easier for people to understand and participate in the Catalyst process.\n\n1. Aggregating proposals under overarching projects\nProposals should be able to be aggregated under a single project. On the community website, proposing teams can break down their work into a number of proposals that are linked by a project they created. The project can then detail a description, roadmap and social links to give an overview of the overall project objectives and current development sprints.\n\n2. Creating team profiles\nThe website will allow project collaborators to have a profile that lists any social accounts and share the skills they have. This will provide more accountability and be a starting point for new team members who want to engage in a project team.\n\n3. Categorizing the proposals\nProposals are currently not well categorized and easy to filter. The website will filter through all Catalyst proposals according to topics, teams and funding success.\n\nRoadmap\n\nThe proposal aims to provide a single defined part in a community website that provides a central source of information which is constantly updated. It makes it as easy as possible for a community member to find and learn more about Catalyst projects they are interested in.\nIntegrating improved proposal data into the website will take ~5 weeks of work. In the long term, more features will be added to achieve more meaningful participation within the community.\nIf you want to look at all solution ideas that will be integrated in the community website, take a look:\nhttps://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Catalyst-Community-Site-2b0616bedeb94c13a135d565eb883412\n\nDevelopment steps\n\nDefine the category identifiers data model and share under an open source Github profile.\nAdd data structures for projects and categories to the website database\nImplement a backend to allow a team to manage a project and link their proposals\nDocument a process for pre-existing proposals to be added to the site automatically and allow for the team to claim ownership in the site\nCreate a frontend for the project list and project pages\n\nExpected initial implementation launch date ~30th May (+/- 1 week)\n\nAuditability:\n\nThe project is currently under development, weekly updates can be found here: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Project-Updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nShort term (3 months): Number of users viewing project lists and project information compared to total participants in Ideascale.\n\nLonger term (6-12 months): Tracking interactions between voters, advisors and proposers to determine if the quality of proposals is increasing over time as project and proposal information improves.\n\nTeam and collaboration\n\nThe team consists of 3 international people with background in informatics, science, economics, psychology and political science:\n\nGeorge L - Web and mobile developer of over 5 years (mainly React, React Native, JGraphQL, Serverless and Prisma).

Community Advisors and interested proposers have to filter through a variety of channels in order to stay informed and get the relevant information. While formats like the weekly townhall, Discord and Telegram Channels convey a lot of information, they don't explain the relevant processes in a short and concise way. The easier it is to understand the processes the better we can facilitate more effective engagement.\n\nThe purpose of having educational resources will be to document the Catalyst process in a visually appealing and easy to understand format. The Project Catalyst Community Website will become a central source for education, collaboration and information about the Project Catalyst funding process. The resources will be updated as the Catalyst process changes and improves over time.\n\nWhat educational resources will be added?\n\nThe initial implementation will consist of two main parts for the education resources:\n\nEstablishing a Community Calendar - Community members should always be able to easily see what is happening at the moment in the Catalyst funding process. A Calendar will help members more easily to work out what they should be doing or plan for at any given moment.\nAggregating Relevant Resources - Information about Catalyst that are clustered throughout different channels will be aggregated on the Project Catalyst Community Website and inform relevant stakeholders in a concise way.There will be information to address the needs of Community Advisors, proposers and voters. This information will be updated as the Catalyst funding changes over time and linked to other resources or social accounts that people may want to use.\n\n \n\nRoadmap\n\nThe proposal aims to provide a central place within the community website to provide the source of information that can be constantly updated.\n\nIntegrating education resources into the website will take ~3 weeks of work. In the long term, more features will be added to achieve more meaningful participation in the community. If you want to look at all solution ideas that will be integrated in the community website, take a look: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Catalyst-Community-Site-2b0616bedeb94c13a135d565eb883412\n\nDevelopment steps\n\nGather and format the Project Catalyst data for the calendar information to add to the website database\n\nCreate the calendar page based off the Catalyst data\n\nCreate the resources page using the content from content creators, any existing Catalyst landing pages (e.g. https://project-catalyst.github.io/)))) plus any further visual improvements\n\nOngoing collaboration with all content creators, community members and developers to integrate any of their current or planned education resources\n\nExpected initial implementation launch date is ~16th May (+/- 1 week)\n\n \n\nAuditability:\n\nThe project is currently under development, weekly updates can be found here: https://www.notion.so/cardanocommunity/Project-Updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nShort term (3 months): Number of users viewing the calendar and resources section and qualitative feedback on the usefulness of the resources\n\nLonger term (6-12 months): Tracking the number of information requests about the Catalyst proposal on the website or community members to determine the number of people and percentage that need help with the funding process.

KEWW will be the ignorant non-technical guy who asks the questions that are obvious to aficionados, but need explanation and analogous interpretation to help people along the journey from 'I have no idea what is going on', to 'Okay that makes more sense now, here's the direction to go so I can get involved.'\n\n \n\nThink of it this way… you are reading this proposal in real time so it's a pretty sure thing you know more than your parents, your children and even your co-worker in the cubicle next to you about crypto anything. To make the world a better place, you want them to get turned on to this world, and fast forward right into Cardano, specifically getting involved with Project Catalyst.\n\n \n\nHow many times do you want to have that conversation? Are you topical enough to cover what might be their point of entry… probably not. After this series is available and you have it at your disposal, and you want to teach any one of those people about any of these topics at a basic introductory level, send them the link to the right video and they can go from there. You will have the confidence that they are not following hype videos and end up landing off in a different realm, nor do they have to take the amount of time you took to find the best information available.\n\n \n\nLet's take a look at what we will be talking about first:\n\n \n\nFocused Video Series:\n\nFirst Video – Who is KEWW? - This will be an introduction & familiarization video, defining the goals of the following nine videos in the series, featuring a \"sit down\" with KEWW so that the audience can get comfortable with the host and understand that this series is a high point tour.\nSecond Video – What is Cardano & Project Catalyst? - Discussion with KEWW and (Someone like, or possibly even, Dor?!) who can walk KEWW through the 30,000' view of what Project Catalyst is, and does, within Cardano.\nThird Video – What is a Node / Stake Pool? - Discussion with KEWW and the team at ARMing Cardano, talking about Cardano System Nodes and what building an (affordable) Stake Pool is all about.\nFourth Video – What is a Token on Cardano? - Discussion with KEWW and {TBD} about what tokens are all, how they work and even how to create them on Cardano.\nFifth Video – What is an NFT? - Discussion with KEWW and the team at NFT DAO(?), talking about what NFT's look like on the Cardano Blockchain, and what it takes to create them.\nSixth Video – What are Smart Contracts? - Discussion with KEWW and {TBD}, talking about what smart contracts are, what they will look like on the Cardano Blockchain and why they are so important.\nSeventh Video – Who are Goguen, Basho and Voltaire? - Discussion with KEWW and {TBD}, talking about the Cardano Roadmap and why it is important to understand where Cardano is at and what the Project Catalyst role is in moving forward.\nEighth Video – How do you get funded with Project Catalyst? - Discussion with KEWW and {TBD}, talking about the process from successful proposal creation to presentation of your delivered return on intention.\nNinth Video – How do you vote to fund projects in Project Catalyst? - Discussion with KEWW and {TBD} , talking about the voting process from interaction with proposers in the refinement stage through Ideascale to receiving rewards and feeling great for doing your part.\nTenth Video – What are the roles in Project Catalyst? - Discussion with KEWW and {TBD}, talking about the official and unofficial roles throughout the Project Catalyst community.\n\n \n\nKEWW will take people along a journey from who he is, to touch base at all the high points and current major considerations of Blockchain technology as it relates to Cardano. In each video, KEWW will be getting an \"Inner\" view from Project Catalyst players, and have the discussions with experts and learners who are embedded within the Project Catalyst Community and previously funded projects.\n\n \n\nThe series itself will be as \"evergreen\" as possible, and production will keep in mind that certain segments will need to be updated or negated all together as technology advances. Even those videos will maintain a level of education though, as to how things led to wherever the future viewer is watching from.\n\n \n\nThere will be a primary \"Cardano Project Catalyst with KEWW\" website established that has a front page introduction to the video series, and links to all things that have been generated from them. On one particular page there will be updated KPI metrics, derived from social media analytics, as well as the collected data collected from survey results. This will allow real time (as possible) validation from the community what this product is delivering. This can be an open source of reference material for others developing media content so they can see what networks are generating the biggest buzz.\n\n \n\nTo aid in drawing more members into the Project Catalyst Ecosystem, KEWW will be present in all major social networking platforms, and join the developing networks growing on top of Cardano itself. This will also generate key metrics to measuring throughput and assist with analytics for other media attempts as the projects grow.\n\n \n\nSurveys will be developed for each particular video, which results aggregate into the above mentioned web page. Questions will be included that address the exact data requested from the F5 challenge metrics, like what percent of viewers are active CA's, Town Hall Viewers, Voters, Proposers, referrers, what brought them to the video and what they want out of Project Catalyst. In addition, there will be a follow up feedback survey requested from anyone associated with this project and it's videos, outlining any realized increases of traffic or membership to their projects.\n\n \n\nIn an attempt to demonstrate my personal \"Proof of Work\", as my previous video creation material is not available to the public, I have begun an \"Elevator Pitch\" Video Series. (All linked below and available on the YouTube Page listed above) The intention has been to host simple brief inner-views with current active members in the project who are seeking team members, those who believe they should be sought after and those who need a platform to promote their own proposals. These videos can be linked directly to the proposals as promotional videos (meet the maker type stuff), we take the time to produce and publish the video, so they can take the time to develop and build the new world! The big win in this effort is the beginning of networking throughout the community, as well as dialing in the hardware and software requirements needed. This is an assurance of the best accuracy of the funding requested at this time. An additional KPI bonus for anyone who watches these videos sees the improvement over time, and then see the funded video series. The quality will be the result of this very proud and productive Project Catalyst community effort, from start to finish!\n\n \n\nKey KPI Data Results:\n\nGiven this open source data is not freely available presently with other projects it is hard to say \"this project will generate X number of viewers or Y number of new CA's (yet!). What it will do though is present a fact based data set showing the results of surveys offered/surveys answered, and the results of each compared against the number of views from each video and what the influence is from the KEWW followers in each platform. While this is not my area of expertise, the portion of this funding requested will be available to those professional marketers who can aid in extrapolating the correct data and steer the project in the right direction for increased throughput.\n\n \n\nCurrent networking is developing through creation of the Elevator Pitch Series and many of the individuals to be interviewed are penciled in. Collaboration with other media creators within Cardano and Project Catalyst is already under way, so best practices are being developed. By the time funding is allocated much of the ground work will be completed paving the acceleration straight into video series layout, script/Q&A development and scheduling for all interview and content creation archive build up in the first three months time. The next quarter will be production and editing of all ten videos to ensure steady flow from start to finish and continuity of visual looks. All videos should launch in succession by schedule within a two week period for full marketing effect. Throughout the process, snip video \"teasers\" (more specifically, pertinent timely information from the unreleased archive) can be released to gain momentum across the platforms. Long term success following the video series release will realize the full development of an active community of media content creators. All members will be intent on helping each other through graphic art, video production tips & techniques, Writing and Editing of content, Marketing value efforts and leads on features for each team.\n\n \n\nAnticipated Delivery Dates:\n\nDevelopment of Website and media presence across applicable platforms by July 2021\nContinued creation and release of Elevator Pitch videos to promote Project Catalyst, KEWW and dry run all analytical data points and surveys within the website.\nRelease dates for all 10 full length videos will be in September 2021, scheduled to post two per week, for 5 weeks.\nWebsite management and upkeep on all statistical data\n\n \n\nBudget Request Summary: $8,900 total\n\nWebsite Development & Upkeep: $1,000\nSurvey Development and aggregation management: $500\nSoftware (Sound/Transcription/Editing): $600\nHardware (Lighting/Camera/TP/Mic): $800\nService Fees (Web/Software/Sound/Membership): $400\nAvailable funds for professional Services (Marketing/Graphic Artist/Advanced Editing): $3,200\n$15/hr x 16hrs/video x 10 videos: $2,400\n\n \n\nThe budget identified in this fund will cover the anticipated cost of the resources needed to produce ten videos in the series, provide sufficient timely KPI aggregation that can be evaluated in progress through future funding opportunities and establishment of social media promotion and sites.\n\nWhat does the FUTURE road map potential look like for KEWW after video series release:\n\n~Creation of [KEWW] Stake Pool as a result of effort provided by the series contribution (This is currently shaping up to be an investment out of pocket in the present tense.) With the marketing push generated by this effort, it may allow for enough SPO revenue to generate cash flow to perpetuate future videos based on demand and changing technology and Cardano road map phases\n~Creation of \"Cardano Project Catalyst with KEWW\" Tokens on Cardano.

While these goals are of the highest priority for members of the blockchain community, many times these platforms have difficulty fully executing on these promises.\n\n \n\nDue to the intrinsic hub-and-spoke nature of social media platforms, data must be centrally gathered, stored, and then distributed to subscribers across the network. This can make it difficult to store, process, and provide access to data in a truly decentralized fashion. Some platforms utilize IPFS or other blockchain project based third-party solutions for decentralized storage, but the overall storage strategy is still controlled by the social media platform leadership.\n\n \n\nDirect storage on the main blockchain of social media metadata originating from an individual user's app-session such as posts, links, statistics, voting, images, etc. would be more decentralized. However, this would be far more costly to maintain due to transaction frequency and size-sensitive fees and would require the social media platform hub to continuously query the blockchain for updates which makes this strategy unrealistic.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, giving application users full control of the storage and marketability of their metadata may involve expenses and responsibilities that most users would find unpalatable, or even intimidating. So, it would seem, even if there were no concerns around the implementation of decentralized storage for social media, achieving this level of control for users may create a barrier to adoption in and of itself.\n\n \n\nTaking all of these factors into account, it becomes apparent that a more complete, purpose-built solution may be needed to address these needs in a standardized and frictionless way on the Cardano network that will attract billions of users across a multitude of social media platforms.\n\n \n\nSolution\nAccordingly, a Cardano Protocol for Social Media Storage is proposed. The protocol will standardize metadata to be included in certain Cardano main chain transactions initiating the minting of NFTs representing slowly changing entities such as user accounts. User actions such as individual posts on a social media dApp can then initiate further NFT minting transactions on a side chain which refer back to the main chain slowly changing NFT. These secondary, app usage detail-oriented NFTs are then stored and maintained on the Cardano Social Media Side Chain Node operated by an SPO if the user has opted in for NFT storage with an SPO of their choice. SPOs would have the option to host Social Media Storage for multiple social media dApps which utilize the Cardano Social Media Storage Protocol.\n\n \n\nUsing this side chain/NFT approach greatly limits the volume and size of social media application-related transactions on the Cardano Main Chain, and facilitates sharding, encryption, and archival storage of the individual user's data across a stake pool style network of SPOs. Incentives can then be provided to SPOs and social media dApp users through opt-in licensing to access whichever classes of their NFTs the user wishes to monetize or not via a personal data dashboard. Since individual posts, photos, etc. are stored as NFTs, the user will have the ability to pull any NFT off of the stake pool and do with it what they will. Also, access rewards or purchase receipts for NFTs can be accumulated in a wallet feature of a social media dApp. The tokenomics of this model may vary from dApp to dApp but the gathering, storage and maintanence of the user data would follow the Cardano Social Media Storage protocol standard.\n\n \n\nAt a high level, the architecture to support the protocol beyond the scope of this proposal's POC deliverables could include but will likely not be limited to:\n-Cardano Main Chain Node\n-Cardano Social Media Metadata Side Chain Node\n-NFT-based storage and schema for various user-owned digital assets for profiles, individual posts, subscriptions, voting stats, etc.\n-Cardano Stake Pool Operator Management Console for social media assets (NFTs)\n-Archived data extraction API to facilitate authorized user access to metadata contained within the NFTs\n\n \n\nRoadmap\nThis proposal is for a realistic Research & Development effort for a new Cardano Protocol and will involve:\n\n \n\nMonth1\n-Broadened Requirements Gathering & Due Dilligence\n-IOG Metadata Team Collaboration\n-Begin Architecture & Design\n\n \n\nMonth2\n-Continue Architecture & Design\n-Begin POC Development\n\n \n\nMonth3\n-Continue POC Development\n-POC Testing\n-POC Delivery\n\n \n\nFurther development, testing, and rollout to be completed in future Catalyst Fund iterations\n\n \n\nUltimately, the POC should demonstrate the utility of the Cardano Social Media Storage Protocol for the purpose of developing highly decentralized social media distributed applications with Cardano. The POC will also comprise the base technology to make it possible for social media platform users to have simple, seamless storage options for their data that makes monetization and portability of owned data assets easy and fun.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352759-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nin dev\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352712-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352707-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nCurrent NFT implementations in Cardano are not truly decentralized if they depend on third-party services to manage the storage and access of the asset. There is no guarantee that these services will be around for years to come and therefore assets can be lost.\nIPFS/Filecoin or Arweave are these kinds of technologies that allow storing any kind of information and accessing it through its unique identifier, known as hash. Taking advantage of Cardano's metadata capabilities, we can take that hash that represents a unique digital asset and attach it into a transaction, establishing a light asset register on-chain, while getting the asset source must require a query to an external storage service.\nThere are use cases that require these third party services to achieve optimal performance. For example, game assets or collectibles campaigns. But there are other use cases where it is necessary to ensure the existence and accessibility of the asset in the long term, some, even for a lifetime. For example, when we want to save our will or memories.\nIn addition, there are currently very few user-friendly interfaces for minting NFTs on Cardano, and to our knowledge, none of these ensure full ownership of the resulting asset by the original creators—as the actual minting occurs in a third-party service and the policy resides there.\nThat means that the majority of artwork minted as NFT don't provide signatures from creators that can be used to easily check the authenticity of the pieces.\nDESCRIBE YOUR SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM:\nDevelopment of a light wallet that provides sovereignty to mint and sign non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 100% on-chain from digital assets .\nThe idea is to provide a tool developed within the framework of the C64 project so that any artist or user can upload assets to Cardano blockchain in form of metadata attached to native assets. In addition, data will be stamped with identity so it can be easily authenticated from artists' websites or business cards.\nWhen the asset exceeds the maximum size per transaction, it will be splitted as many transactions as necessary to complete the asset size. We are aware that storing all the information in multiple transactions makes the creation of NFTs more expensive and may load the blockchain with too much non-essential information. That is why only specific use cases are best suited to this solution.\nAs a light wallet, it will rely on third party servers to interact with the blockchain, in the same way as Yoroi, that's why we'll be adding an option during the minting process so GUI will be able to choose the blockchain endpoints, either Gimbalabs (Dandelion) or any other trusted source.\nBRIEF PROPOSED SOLUTION\nTools and specifications for minting assets coupled with fully on-chain metadata as well as with the owners' signatures, allowing creators and artists to distribute authenticated and verifiable content, while at the same time ensuring long-term availability.\nDETAILED PROPOSED SOLUTION\nOverview\n- Adopt cardano-meta-handler for embedding any content-type file. Using the http response standard makes the implementation easier and more familiar to developers, as well as facilitating the processing of the asset thanks to the declaration of its type.\n- Create a multi-platform light wallet for desktop to mint NFTs. By using these cross-platform technologies and open source frameworks we guarantee the best practices and community adoption.\n- Adopt Yoroi's cardano serialization library to build and serialize metadata transactions 100% on-chain, making the application backend free, and consequently making the wallet lighter.\n- Capability to choose trusted blockchain endpoints. When we use a light wallet we need a third party service to interact with the blockchain, in the same way that Yoroi uses Emurgo's servers. We believe that being able to choose your own endpoints adds a new degree of freedom while promoting decentralization of these services.\n- Assets gallery inside the wallet. In the same way that the wallet allows you to create new NFTs and add them to the blockchain, the wallet includes a gallery that query any NFT stored in the blockchain.\nBLOCKING PROBLEM AND EVIDENCES\nAs no smart contract is required, there is no technological limitation to the scope of this proposal.\nFUTURE PLANS\nIn the future and not included as a goal in this proposal, a donations/treasury system will be implemented that enables a sustainable development model for the tool and the operators providing the gateway services to Cardano.\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE:\nCaso as Project Lead.

Instead of only putting metadata information supplied by donors on the blockchain, we decided to use this as a collaboration opportunity to give hands on training to WADA devs on the use of metadata to solve real life problems. In collaboration with GimbaLabs, ABCD & Cardano Pool XYZ we will release a series of prototypes that will set up the framework for encouraging donations traceability and accountability. We will be using this model for our Foundation.\n\nStrategic Landscape & Direction\n\nIn WADA we believe that having a well trained and capable network of core developers is pivotal to our success on the continent and in diaspora.

As this is built out to support different industry recognised use cases, token templates that define consistent structures and metadata for tokens instantiated from the templates can be accessed and used.\n\n \n\nIWA members (https://interwork.org/membership/members/) include leading technology and blockchain organisations and form specialised working groups to identify and develop the required token standards. IWA members will also be able to complete a certification program to allow users of their applications or frameworks to have confidence that they are compliant.\nAs the IWA are establishing business standards for tokens, they do not stipulate any particular technical implementation approach.\n\nInterNFT (https://internft.org/)\n\nInterNFT are a group formed to define technical standards to make NFTs interoperable across blockchains and to enable ownership, control and rights management of NFT metadata and linked resources regardless of their location.\nFrom a metadata perspective this work has begun by engaging former members of the W3C Credentials Community Group that worked on the DID standard for Decentralised Identifiers. The new InterNFT standard being developed is building on DIDs to define NFTs as (quite rightly) a specific form of DID. The new standard will be DID compliant, but will also provide metadata specific to the requirements of NFTs. This approach will not only make all NFTs uniquely addressable across all blockchains, but will support NFT interactions cross chain.\n\n \n\nThis approach aligns well with the groundwork IOG has put in to support DIDs on Cardano with Atala PRISM, so we are confident that the NFT DAO framework would be able to incorporate this new standard quite easily.\n\nNFT DAO Memberships\n\nAs NFT DAO are aiming to provide a comprehensive NFT framework that can be utilised by any project planning to implement NFTs on Cardano, it is important that we not only incorporate these developing standards into our framework, but also represent the needs of all Cardano projects building on NFT DAO as part of the standards.\n\n \n\nThis proposal is part one of our funding request for becoming members of these standards organisations. We would like to become a paid member of the IWA at a current annual fee of $5,000. This membership will make NFT DAO eligible to participate in the NFT working group and also have our NFT framework certified.\n\n \n\nIn future funding rounds, we would also like to become a sponsored member of InterNFT to ensure Cardano's requirements are considered as their standard continues to be developed.\n\nCommunity Involvement\n\nWe are always looking for new members to join NFT DAO. A recording of our first NFT DAO Standards meeting is available at\n\nwhere we talk more about the ideas covered in this proposal. If anyone would like to join our future Standards meetings then please join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/YsKwGQEs97 for more information.\n\n \n\nDEFINED SUCCESS REPORTING\n\n3-month: The dues will be paid and participation begun.\n\n6-month: Active and Fully engaged and contributing.\n\n12-month: Ready for yearly dues to be paid again ;-)\n\nTEAM\n\nPhil Lewis, Has IT experience in a broad range of roles (such as technical, architectural and management) and a well balanced perspective, allowing development of solutions that incorporates the best technical fit as well as achieving the non-technical objectives for the business.\n\nMichael Yagi, a senior software engineer with experience facilitating integration between different technologies across many different facets in a smooth, seamless fashion.

Furthermore, the communication of performance metrics amongst machine-learning algorithms enables reinforcement learning use cases and distributed AI a la SingularityNET.\nSome background and rationale for the proposal can be found here: https://flyncd.github.io/\nThe Team\nEach team member brings over a decade of experience as Data Science professionals responsible for building, assessing, deploying and monitoring credit risk, fraud, sentiment analysis, graph analytics and propensity models.\nThis is the team's first Catalyst proposal.

The qCreditScore proposed by Liqwid Finance, is a good example of an automated service where users would desire periodic assessments of the score's predictive-power, accuracy, stability and calculation. Adding this layer of transparency and validation to the DeFi system would serve to promote take up and usage.\nDeliverable #2 - Create a simulated demo of a \"Credit Risk\" model which is capable of assessing the likelihood that an entity (such as an Atala Prism Decentralised Identity) will default in the next 3 months.\nDeliverable #3 - Produce a script to periodically collate and publish metrics. The summary of which is published as a blockchain transaction.\nDemonstrate reporting of metadata\nReporting on stored metadata, particularly using metrics that can be assessed over long time periods is where the long-term utility of a proposal such as this will help the Cardano community.\nDeliverable #4 - Provide a tool which can query and aggregate metadata stored on the Cardano blockchain that targets a specific metric (eg Gini or KS for the qCreditScore model). The tool should be portable enough so that any user capable of querying the underlying Cardano blockchain metadata can produce reports.\nReport on findings\nOnce the project is finalised, write up the results and publish to the project website.\nDeliverable #5 - Add a supplementary section to project website detailing lessons learnt, unsolved questions and future work.\nFAQ\nWhy is the blockchain an appropriate store of this information?\nA decentralised, transparent reporting of performance metrics for oracles on a blockchain ensures authenticity of the performance data. Transparent reporting and verification of these metrics over time can produce an authentic permanent record which can be assessed using time series analysis.\nWhat data will be used to build the credit score simulation?\nPeer-to-peer lending data. For example, the Udacity dataset for Prosper.\nWhat will you use the requested funds for?\nFunds to be used as remuneration for one month of development effort, standing up development infrastructure for testnet and a mainnet demonstration application.\nWhat is the desired outcome of this project?\nThe goal is to see the framework and tool being used amongst the Cardano community, ideally making future projects possible and successful. In the medium to long term, we hope to help the community to develop future projects and/or improve tools by releasing details about the successes, pinch points and other lessons learnt during the project development.\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352231-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nDesired Outcome\nAn ideal outcome could be described by providing a couple of practical examples:\n\nGiovanni, a SPO, beside running a pool, also runs the full suite of systems (eg. graphql, db-sync, etc) required to interact with the cardano blockchain. Paula, a young developer, wants to experiment on Cardano, but doesn't want to run all-the-things Cardano, but \"just\" interact w/ the graphql layer. Giovanni wants to grant Paula (and Paula only) the rights to use his apis. Giovanni's apis implement a blockchain (cardano) friendly auth mechanism where he issues a token (NFT) used to authenticate and describe the level of authorization to Paula.\nA large holidays booking company has launched on cardano. They also launched their iOS and Android native apps to browse and book holiday packages. In order to allow the Native Apps to work properly, they should be granted a limited set of permissions to interact with the apis, these apps need to be authenticated and authorised, ideally in a blockchain friendly way.\nIncentivise the technical community to spin their own set of Cardano APIs to support the developer ecosystem and at the same time to monetize the traffic on such APIs. dandelion.link[0] is an open source project designed to easily manage Cardano APIs. Integrating the auth mechanism will provide the technical community with the tools to monetise, and hence incentivise, the setup of their own set of APIs. This will hopefully lead to a Cardano API marketplace that will facilitate the development and operation of more and more dApps as well as ensuring a resilient infrastructure by eliminating single point of failures (an example of a SPOF is given by Infura on Ethereum : \"If we don't stop relying on Infura, the vision of ethereum failed\" - link: https://www.coindesk.com/the-race-is-on-to-replace-ethereums-most-centralized-layer).\nProposed Solution\nThe solution focuses on three main aspects:\nIdentifying client/customer and the service provider in the system\nAuthenticate the client\nGrant the client account, or sub account, with the correct permissions.\nOur solution leverages wallet addresses as a key concept to identify an actor. Such actors can initiate a signup/subscription mechanism, issuing an on-chain transaction to a service provider's wallet. At this point, we have identified two actors: the user/client/customer and the service provider.\nUnfortunately at this point, while we have a representation of the client's user id (the wallet utxo) we don't have a secret that can accompany it and be used to authenticate calls to our services.\nFor this reason we could leverage metadata to exchange a hashed temporary (few minutes) secret, that can be then used, at network/api level, to establish an initial secure channel between parties.\nAt this point the signup/subscription mechanism can be completed and the result will be an NFT with metadata required to authenticate a user.\nRoadmap\nImplement version 1 of the auth mechanism (signup and login) - Within 3 months\nIntegrate version 1 o the auth mechanism into Dandelion.Link - Within 3 months\nProvide educational content in form of both documents and tutorial on how to stand up and customise dandelion.link - Most of the work will be done within 6 months\nSubmit proposal for version 2 of the auth mechanism (sub accounts and Access Control List) to future round of Catalyst\n\nReferences:\n[0]: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dandelion-Cardano-API-market/352562-48088\nSuccess Metrics\n\n\nImplement v1 of the actual auth feature within the first 3 months and integrate it in dandelion.link\nDocument and evangelise the approach and try to help/integrate in at least another project within 6 months\nUse community expertise and feedback to iterate over the solution and aim to define a standard on how to implement blockchain friendly auth mechanism.\nCost Breakdown\n3000$ dev costs to implement the solution\n1000$ dev costs to integrate solution into dandelion.link\n1000$ build comprehensive documentation\n1000$ produce videos/tutorial on how to adopt auth framework\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352005-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351236-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351202-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nI already created CardanoWall, that provides a working solution.\n\nLevel 1 (rolled-out):\n\nThere is a concept called Proof of Existence. A hash value of digital data, such as a file, can be included in a transaction. Since the data cannot be changed once on the blockchain, nothing can be added retrospectively, and this hash value cannot be faked. This means that a message with a hash value is proof that your data existed when the message was sent. The blockchain acts as a cryptographic notary who is impartial and inflexible. The algorithm for obtaining a hash sum is a one-way function. You cannot get back the contents of your data from it, and you do not disclose the contents of the data to it.\n\nLevel 2 (rolled-out):\n\nI went much further and developed the idea of \"Proof of Existence\" with several new layers. Utilizing cryptography capabilities, you can now anonymously sign your Proof of Existence and, if necessary, prove in court that the data is yours, you are the owner of the private key, and the author of the signed message.\n\nLevel 3 (rolled-out + new features in progress):\n\nBut this is just the beginning. Using these same solid cryptographic techniques, you can encrypt your data and store it on the public internet. Only you, as the private key owner, can decrypt the data or get a long and complex password to decrypt it. In case of data loss, you have the option to recover the data. Since each file is encrypted with its own secure password, you can share the password from a specific file. Working with keys, encrypting and decrypting data takes place exclusively on your side, in your browser. The keys and the content of the original data are never transmitted to the server. All used encryption and hashing algorithms are reliable and safe to use. Whether you are a book author, musician, photographer, artist, designer, or even a business working with important documents, CardanoWall can help you create concrete proof of your work.\n\nUpdate: A new feature is at the testing phase. It allows the creation of PoE for any internet page. CardanoWall creates a full-size screenshot + WARC file containing all internal and external elements like images, CSS styles, JS scripts, etc. CardanoWall takes care of the technical part and loads all files in the client's browser to create a PoE record with an additional option to include encrypted versions to CW storage. This feature helps proving the usage of copyrighted materials without permission. It is in demand among lawyers for the protection of intellectual property rights. People can also monitor and save fake news on the internet or store a copy of new official information posted on government websites. This functionality will become available in the first week of May.\n\nLevel4 (in progress):\n\nCurrently, I am working on additional features with a clear vision about the next fourth level of PoE that will enable secure and encrypted communication on the Cardano blockchain between parties or additional applications. It will bring more real-life usage and attract businesses to use CW for providing bonus materials tied to a purchased product with an included private key.\n\nFunding\n\nAt the moment, I am doing all the back-end/front-end/marketing work myself. Additional funding will allow me to allocate more time to the CardanoWall project, hire a JS developer to improve in-browser encryption of large files, hire advisors to fulfill criteria from courts and legal structures of different countries. It can also cover some costs for CardanoWall public storage/redundancy + additional external servers used for creating screenshot/warc files described in the update above.\n\nBack-end: me, an additional senior JS developer, Cryptography/Cybersecurity specialist, independent security audit for BE and FE: 35000 USD\n\nFront-end: UX/UI improvements as new features appear, redesign: 2500 USD\n\nInfrastructure for 1 year (prod/dev/api servers, storage servers, crawlers for page PoE): 3000 USD\n\nMarketing: additional professional materials to onboard businesses, such as an explainer video I created. Online ads and social networks promotions: 17000 USD\n\nThe amount I am asking may seem high, but it's definitely not enough. That's why I also fund the project from the entire profit of my [VICE] stake pool that is producing blocks because of a high pledge I invested in it. By supporting my pool you support the further development of CardanoWall.\nhttps://vicepool.com/\n\nMentoring\n\nI would be happy to receive support and help from IOHK experts in the form of mentoring in cryptography, which takes a large and important part of the CardanoWall project.\n\nAdditional usage\n\nCardanoWall offers much more than I could describe in a short problem statement/solution. You can effortlessly send messages to the Cardano blockchain network without needing to understand the technical goings-on behind the scenes. Your message will become part of the blockchain and will remain there forever. You can also include other types of information other than text, such as an image or geo-position, along with the text message. So it's a Twitter/Instagram built on a blockchain. Some artists already started using CardanoWall as an NFT platform to pass a private key that can decrypt the original artwork. Many new possibilities appear as the project develops with new features.\n\n \n\nRoadmap:\n\nMay 2021: A new feature for creating PoE of internet pages. It will be helpful to proving the usage of copyrighted materials without permission and monitoring fake news, official government statements.\n\nMay-June 2021: Public API for automatic creation of PoE records without the usage of CardanoWall website.\n\nQ3 2021: An option to use individual wallets/addresses for businesses. Additional features for business accounts.\n\nQ4 2021: Level 4 features for secure encrypted communication and transferring access to CW storage encrypted files.\n\nQ3 2021 - Q1 2022: Building custom solutions for businesses and onboarding more companies for PoE usage on the Cardano blockchain.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350923-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nSummary:\nIn India, cases of fake degrees and forged certificates have been rising rapidly in recent years. When that is coupled with increasing unemployment rates, it results in a significant number of candidates applying for every single job position available on the market.\nThis means for recruiters it becomes an uphill battle to verify the credibility of each applicant's credentials reliably.\nWe are thus proposing a solution to use the metadata feature of Cardano Blockchain to create a platform that helps Universities, Recruiters, and degree holders alike to authorize, validate and securely store their certificate records in an easily accessible manner.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDetailed Problem Statement:\nIn India and many other developing countries, The process of checking these degree certificates generates a lot of documentation, and storing them digitally necessitates a central authority in charge of managing the records, which opens the door to tampering and data loss. Some academic institutions make it simple and quick to check the validity of their qualifications online, without even asking who needs the information. Others assign the responsibility to third parties (by design or regulation), while others market the service. Finally, there are times when there is no other option but to contact the academic secretary's office at the educational institution to validate the legitimacy of a credential or qualification. Academic degree fraud, on the other hand, is a reality that arises with the involvement of authorities and institutional employees.\nIndia, as a populous country with a large youth population and a gateway to numerous educational opportunities, lacks a consistent, stable, reliable, and tamper-proof method of verifying credentials. This is a significant disadvantage since there are a large number of fraud cases, which slows down the growth of our education sector and job markets. The existing tools available are insufficiently safe to keep fraud to a bare minimum. They, sadly, have numerous flaws and, on top of that, are ineffective in terms of cost.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat we're trying to achieve. (Project Description)\nTo develop a decentralized application on the top of Cardano's blockchain to combat this serious problem.\n\nSince blockchain technology is resistant to data manipulation, it makes the validation of academic qualifications tamper-proof.\nThe date (Timestamp) from which a piece of data is recorded cannot be changed and is publicly verifiable which is very crucial to verify the date on which a particular degree is being issued to a student.\nThere's no need for a central authority.\nThe use of Metadata:\nClient (Universities) will upload the content metadata from the digital degree and our platform will encode the metadata and assign it a unique key for each student.\nThe metadata will then be attached to the transaction as Cardano gives us the ability to add metadata to blockchain transactions and the encoded information will be stamped onto Cardano's blockchain.\nEach transaction will use our private native token which will help us with traceability and accountability.\nThe stamped information will be easily verifiable with our deqree platform.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome Guiding questions\nWhy does the target audience care about the solution?\nOur solution makes the process of authorizing and validating certificates an easy-to-use and straightforward process.\nDoes the solution need hardware components?\nThe user can access our services via a smartphone or PC.\nHow does this create value for Cardano?\nOur project has the potential to bring in thousands of new users to the Cardano Ecosystem as India's higher education market is estimated to be over 37 million students and currently facing this serious issue.\nSeveral other such questions have been addressed in the attached white paper.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExpenses:\nWebsite Domain and Hosting costs ($1500)\nHardware Costs ($5000)\nCloud server hosting costs($1500)\nLogistics costs($2500)\nSome ADA reserved for testing($500)\nA buffer for future unforeseen expenses($2000)\nA Monthly Stipend for the team members for 6 months($12000)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimeline:\nOctober 2021- Testnet Deployment\nDecember 2021- Mainnet Launch\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFuture Plans:\nWe will start from a small scale in India and once our capabilities expand we could start offering our services to Institutions outside the country.\n\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350883-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\"From data abuse to personal data control\" – implementing and developing on top of Cardano a metadata store to that give people control over their personal information and demonstrate when an individual exercised a data subject right.\n\nCardano adoption and impact - We are currently launching the Profila App with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions in Q1 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected in 2021; 78.200 expected in 2022. More info under the detailed plan, section 5.\n\nShort summary of the Profila app (as testing ground for the metadata ledger POC) - Profila is a platform (consisting of both a mobile IOS and Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call \"Brands\") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance. Organizations can be either private or public entities.\n\nConsumers can manage their digital life in one location. They can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see \"Illustration 1 – Profila for Consumers\" attached to this proposal).\n\nBefore going into the proposal, the concept of \"data subject rights\" needs some explanation.\n\n1. The concept of data subject rights as a legal tool for individuals to start controlling their data\n\nA first step to data control is knowing your rights in relation to your data and taking action against those who misuse your data. This can be done via \"data subject rights\", as explained briefly below.\n\nNumerous national and regional privacy or consumer protection laws, regulations and jurisprudence provide private individuals – often called \"data subjects\" – with certain rights in relation to their personal data. Under certain conditions, these rights can be enforced against businesses that process personal data.\n\nThese rights are often called \"data subject rights\" or \"data rights\" and may include e.g.\n- right to information - the right to be informed about how a business uses your personal data\n- right to opt out - people can ask businesses to stop selling their personal information or using it for business benefit;\n- right to access – ask access to personal data that is being processed by a business (e.g. ; hen you want to know just how much data a company has about you);\n- right to be forgotten – ask a business to delete your personal data (e.g. when you don't want to receive any products anymore, and definitely no more marketing messages);\n- right to rectification – ask a business to rectify personal information about you that is inaccurate or incomplete (e.g. they have your old address or there is a typo in your name);\n\nWe can find these rights in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA); the Brazilian General Data Protection Regulation (LGDP) and many more.\n\nThe main goal of these rights it to GIVE CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONAL DATA. These laws (GDRP, CCPA; LGDP) include many obligations for companies; namely to (i) inform consumers of these rights; (ii) to help them exercise these rights; (iii) to timely respond to these rights, mostly within a reasonable period of 15 to 30 days; and (iv) to do this all in a transparent way, and no cost to the individual.\n\n2. Privacy rights today – problems – lack of education and management\n\nToday, you have no control over the use of your personal data. In order to control your data, you need to know what happens to it, and you need to be able to take action against those who misuse it. This is where DSRs come in very handy, as they can be used by each individual to (1) become aware of what personal data is collected; how it is used (=information) and – once you have this information – to (2) tell businesses what to do (different) (e.g. rectify; delete; opt out).\n\nHowever, do you know what your rights are and how you need to exercise them? Today, there is no tool available that lets you learn about your rights and provide you with an easy way to exercise them. Some local websites of data protection authorities provide you with information and templates, but require you to download lengthy word documents, fill out 10-15 elements in these documents, upload them, send them by email or post to the Brand in question. This process is only available for those people who actually know what a data protection authority is (=what?), and who are willing to spend some hours to get the template filled out and send.\n\nThat is where Profila comes in.\n\n3. Profila today - the existing consumer App – first step towards data control via privacy education and data rights management\n\nThe current Profila App has a consumer-friendly privacy education and data rights management dashboard (see \"illustration 2 – Profila Privacy App\").\n\nEducation – the App has 9 basic modules about your privacy rights, explaining to you in understandable terms and with examples \"what is personal data\", \"what is a controller/processor\", \"what are your rights\", what is e.g. \"your right to be forgotten\" (including GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, LGDP in Brazil). They are tools that can be used by consumers to control their data.\n\nRights Management – the App then has a dashboard which allows you to manage your rights, e.g. use your \"right to object\" to tell Wholefoods to stop sending daily emails, or your \"right to be forgotten\" to ask Wholefoods to erase all personal data they hold about you. Profila has reduced this legally difficult process of exercising data subject rights to an easy 3-click step process, where you can (1) choose a company logo (recipient of the right); (2) click on one of the 8 data subject rights, and (3) include an identifier (email; phone). Profila then forwards an official legal template to the business. According to the law that applies to your relationship with this company (which is determined based on your country of residence/nationality), the company will be legally required to respond to you within 15-30 days.\n\n4. Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - implementing DSR transaction metadata on Cardano, to demonstrate/prove that a DSR was exercised\n\nWhat do we seek to improve via this Challenge?\n\nIssue - \"centralized DSR management\" - Each data subject right (DSR) that is exercised by an individual using Profila (including the specific terms like which DSR, data, company recipient, specific content and request), is only saved by Profila in our IT environment, and can only be enforced by Profila or its existence proven by Profila. Profila is therefore guaranteeing that the legal request/transaction happened, what terms it contains, whether terms are abided by (e.g. did the business actually respond to the request in time, as they are legally obligated to do).\n\nThis is a liability for both contracting parties, who would need to trust Profila. Profila, as a commercial company, would have to actively step in as arbitrator/mediator, and guarantee this level of trust that a transaction took place + terms thereof. However, we only want to provide consumers with the tools to control their data. The trust and consensus that a transaction took place or contract was made needs to come from the community of users.\n\nUnder the Catalyst project (fund 5), we want to tackle this issue by making available on Cardano a ledger for all privacy interactions that you as an individual exercised via the Profila privacy rights management platform: each user that exercises a data subject right with a brand will be able to easily access each such request, including the brands' response.\n\nE.g. You exercises your right to object to the processing of direct marketing messages to Wholefoods, after receiving 15 mails per week with advertising. If several months after this request, Wholefoods doesn't abide by this request and again starts using your personal data to send you direct marketing messages, you can use the ledger entry as immutable proof of the right you exercised. This way, you can show Wholefoods they breached your right and hold them accountable (unlike the \"unsubscribe\" buttons you click 10x times, with no proof thereof, and with no effect because mails keep on coming). You can even use the information in the ledger to file a complaint at a national data protection authority, showing them what you agreed to, and how the company actually (mis)used your data. You will be able to check forever, every legal right you send to a business concerning the use of your (personal) data. Nobody would be able to tamper with this information. This is control.\n\nWhat other challenges are ahead in our \"Zero-knowledge advertising & insights\" development roadmap?\n\nThis project is only the first step into our broader Cardano technology adoption and integration around zero-knowledge advertising and insights, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. Under the next funds, we want to submit additional project proposals for important features we want to develop as part of this effort:\n\n- step 1 - personal data license smart contract – under Fund 4 \"dapps and integrations\", we submitted a first step in our \"zero knowledge advertising and insights\" project called \"Dapp to control and monetize your data\".\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/341501-48088. This is a crucial step in obtaining \"control over your data\", by concluding smart contract subscriptions with businesses so you have an overview of what kind of data you have granted a business access to, under which conditions. You can access these (smart) contracts at any time to doublecheck the terms of your relationship with a brand (=who did I give access to what data and for what purpose).\n\n- step 2 - privacy ledger – The current privacy ledger step under this metadata challenge is the second step in controlling your data.\n\n- step 3 - zero-knowledge proofs - personalized ads with respect of privacy - using zero-knowledge proofs in order to allow a brand to advertise to the \"perfect\" consumer (meaning to the exact target audience consumer, which exactly matches the specific offering/message a brand wants to share), without sharing ANY personal data with the brand. This in se means that a brand is doing highly relevant and personalized advertising, and a very high cost of conversion (and low cost of engagement), without the privacy risks that the current surveillance marketing model has (=namely, the model requires large amounts of personal data in order to personalize advertising). We will be able to tell when a consumer wants to see an add from which brand, without having to tell the brand who this consumer actually is. Only when the consumer converts (and actually buys a product or service) on the brand's own system, will the brand have access to his/her personal data.\n\n- Step 4 - digital ID - Atala implementation - All digital ID data can be securely stored and encrypted on a user's device, using Cardano 's decentralized public key infrastructure. Each individual can allow organisations access thereto as permissioned by the user; With this integration, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments.\n\n5. Practical aspects – \"show us the money\" – costs\n\nCreating a first proof of concept (POC) of a metadata privacy ledger on Cardano, will require at least a budget of 19.200 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- 15 days of senior developer @ 800 EUR per day – totaling 12.000 USD\n- 15 days of web/backend developer @ 240 EUR per day – totaling +/- 3.600 USD\n- 15 days of app developer @ 240 EUR per hour – totaling +/- 3.600 USD\n\nWe are currently already preparing for the development of this solution – which we are trying to pre-finance – because we believe this is a very important functionality in the control of your data. We expect the solution to be ready by Q2 2021, so that we can test it with the companies that are now using the Profila app with their consumers.\n\n6. Practical aspects – \"getting on the road\" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer\n\nAt the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 5, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.\n\n(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila. These campaigns will show the benefits of Profila (=individual in control; individual compensated) and will attract the first customers to join this kind of new loyalty program. It is therefore not necessary that all the brands' customers join, but mostly the loyal customers that want to be engaged. We project that for SME companies, around 5% of their existing customer base will join this \"new relationship\" in the first year/after the promotional campaign. This would be seen as a success.\n\nWe have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021. According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 in 2022 (by adding more brands).\n\n(2) Geographical focus market? We are currently launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q1 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).\n\n(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy \"Millennials\" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old), and \"brand-loyalists\" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).\nFollowing a research collaboration we conducted with the University of St. Gallen University of Zurich (Switzerland) to define our go-to-market strategy, we concluded that Millennials are the target consumer audience. Millennials carry out most of their transactions online and are aware of their digital footprint. They are also aware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it.\n\n(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers.\n\n(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end-of-April 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).\n\n7. Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)\n\nAs an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:\n\nFirst, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.\n\nSecond, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.\n\nIn addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.\n\nFinally, we are looking into open-sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.\n\n8. Defining success\n\nThe POC we are developing (and hope to get funded for) under this second Catalyst (fund 5) submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to provide people with control of their data and learn about their privacy rights. Success of the POC would be that we can integrate it into our existing App with one of the 5 SME brands that are testing, and make sure it works with their consumers.\n\nSucces after 3 months - finalizing the POC work to be tested in the App\nSucces after6 months - running targeted trials with the POC in the App with real customers\nSucces after 12 months - full deployment of the metadata POC in the App; covering every interaction that includes privacy rights from every user.\n\nOverview of the work-packages which technical requirements and sprints to be included shortly.\n\n9.

We are taking on a very ambitious project, to empower financially excluded communities through shared wealth creation, using an innovative NFT platform to fund housing property development in underserved African markets - a trillion dollar opportunity.\n\n \n\nWhile ambitious, we recognise that big problems need bold innovations and that is why we are forming a team, partnerships and advisors who are experts in their field to collaborate in achieving our goals.\n\n \n\nThe Empowa vision is encapsulated in our introductory Medium article at https://empowa-io.medium.com/introducing-empowa-308792d899e0\n\n \n\nOur full White Paper and links to social media are available on our website at https://empowa.io\n\n \n\nBudget document is available at https://empowa.io/phase-0-budget.pdf\n\n \n\nWatch our interview with Proof of Africa at\n\n \n\nWhile our platform build will be crowdfunded through a token sale, as this will not be done until smart contracts are available on Cardano, this Fund5 Catalyst proposal is seeking funding for our Phase 0 activities, as follows.\n\nPre-Platform Housing Development Proof of Concept\n\nThe success of the Empowa Platform is reliant on those participating having confidence that on-the-ground delivery of the proposed housing development approach is viable. By working with a Project Partner and Approved Supplier to prove that a circular, environmentally friendly and affordable housing project can be implemented, we will demonstrate to those looking to support the platform build through the token sale and those wishing to use the platform once complete, that this innovation is achievable.\n\n \n\nThe following housing development project has therefore been identified as a good candidate for this proof of concept.\nCountry: Mozambique\nCity: Beira\nBackground: Mozambique is one of Africa's most vulnerable countries to climate change. Located on the south-eastern coast of Africa, it is constantly exposed to a number of extreme weather events including droughts, floods and tropical cyclones. In 2000 the country was hit by four cyclones. In 2019 the country was hit by two cyclones destroying homes and displacing thousands.\nChallenges: The financial sector is undeveloped. There are only 600 mortgages in a country of more than 30 million people. As income is largely informal and difficult to measure it is challenging for most people to secure a mortgage through a traditional bank.\nProject Partner: Casa Real (https://www.casareal.co.mz) is a trusted affordable housing developer in Beira, Mozambique who are currently building with traditional materials.\nApproved Supplier: Easy Housing (https://www.easyhousing.org)\nProject Objectives:\n\nEnable Casa Real to develop the first circular and CO2 negative, affordable home in Mozambique.\nProve market acceptance for this environmentally friendly and cyclone-proof building method.\nGive someone financially excluded access to an affordable, structurally secure and environmentally friendly home.\n\n \n\nGiven the current challenges identified for Mozambique, Empowa and our partners believe that a successful demonstration of the proposed housing development approach will result in greater confidence in the Empowa concept and demonstrate that the model can also work in other African countries. We are asking the Cardano community to support us in testing the concept in Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n \n\nBy ensuring this critical first step can be completed, Catalyst funding will be the spark required to ignite the Empowa project, which has the potential to not only \"Grow Africa\" but explode wealth creation throughout Africa, with Cardano being the foundational layer of the Empowa platform. The funds however will not be considered a donation, with the residents of the housing constructed paying to complete their ownership transition (as described in our White Paper). Lease payments will initially be used to fund liquidity required in the Currency Stabiliser (also described in our White Paper) for the Phase 1 platform pilot. Subsequently, the property will be transitioned into the platform for pride of place among other NFTs to enable testing of secondary market trading.\n\nMarketing Campaign\n\nWe believe that realising the impact potential that the Empowa Platform can have is an important step towards achieving real change to the wealth inequality experienced by Africans. Therefore in the lead up to our token sale we would like to promote Cardano and Empowa to gain as much exposure as possible.\n\n \n\nOur Head of PR will coordinate various campaigns including:\n\nCreation of Explainer Videos - making the white paper and proposed solution easier to understand\nCommunity Interviews - Cardano, the broader cryptocurrency community and beyond\nCharitable Organisations - to encourage traditional donors to support our new innovative approach\nDevelopmental Financial Institutions / Corporations / Individuals - who may wish to be seen to be supporting a new and innovative solution\n\n \n\nThis campaign will also highlight and promote Cardano, as many outside of the Cardano community may ask why we selected this blockchain over others. Being given an opportunity to talk about the benefits of using Cardano will not only provide confidence to potential supporters as they learn that we have selected a blockchain built using scientific research and professional development practices (as described in our White Paper), but will also draw their attention to Cardano if they weren't previously aware.\n\n \n\nExcitement experienced by potential supporters over the impact Empowa could have, would likely spill over into Cardano more broadly, with them possibly also engaging in other ecosystem projects.\n\nLimited NFT Release\n\nTo recognise the Cardano community's early contribution to the Empowa project, 50 limited edition NFTs will be minted. All Cardano addresses that participate in the Fund5 vote for the \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\" challenge will be eligible for inclusion in a random draw to receive one of these NFTs.\n\n \n\nAs these NFTs will be issued pre-platform build, once the platform is completed and the full capabilities that NFTs created through it will have are available, these rare NFTs will be transitioned to the platform with special empowerment characteristics.","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352666-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352527-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nWe will launch our crowdsourced imagery collection and mapping platform, paypixl in the fastest-growing African countries in the African Oil Basin (Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Libya, and Egypt).

The African continent should have a strategy for taking a share of this market. We propose a using an IT trend for No-Code development and a strategy called Disruptive Innovation, a term coined by Clayton Christensen to describe using competitive advantage such a low cost labor to grab a share of the market and then \"up-marketing\" to take over more profitable parts of the market. This is the strategy successfully employed by the India IT industry. Leading business strategist Professor Clayton Christensen describes this strategy in the video below:\n\nThe No-Code revolution is an ideal place for the African continent to start its journey of Disruptive Innovation of the IT sector. According to Gartner, the worldwide low-code development technologies market is projected to total $13.8 billion in 2021, an increase of 22.6% from 2020. No-Code will move work from the highly trained IT worker to the Citizen Developer - a person who has little or no technical training but can understand requirements and use a No-Code Platform.\nBy stratigically using its wage advantage, Africa could set up centers for No-Code development that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs across the continent. This would put Africa on the map as an IT center and the first step of Africas disruptive innovation of the IT industry would be accomplished and the process of up-marketing could then begin.\nQModeler is the only No-Code platform that can be used to build blockchain applications and protocols. QModeler uses NFTs to attribute work to teams of hundreds of distributed workers. Using No-Code new layers value worth trillions of dollars will be created simply but connecting existing protocols, integrating on-chain and off-chain protocols and providing the message format transformations required to allows applications to communicate.\nEXPLAINER VIDEO\n\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nGreater employment of Africans. Increased opportunity to engage with US and EU companies. QModeler will track contributions using NFT tokens. A portion of the revenue generated by a component will be shared with the authors of the component. The remaining revenue will be applied to education and marketing. A DOA will be set up to manage how funds are spent.\nVALUE PROPOSITION (Blockchain Ecosystem)\nNo-Node can be the jet fuel for blockchain adoption. Cardano is a network without, as yet, a significant network effect because of its lack of interoperability. No-Code will help blockchain fulfill its purpose of bringing equality to under developed continents like Africa and India by allowing people to develop their own blockchain applications, food safety, payment apps, remittance, cold chain, without needing to give up their independence to large first world corporations.This will create a new layer of value consisting of these connected components and a stronger influence of Metcalf's laws on the network effect that will raise the value of all blockchain apps.\nWe will stop thinking of blockchain protocols as rigid one-size-fits-all solutions and start to think of protocols as a toolbox of components that can be configured, perhaps on the fly, to create custom solutions to diverse sets of problems. Users of blockchain will find a richer ecosystem and a toolbox in which they can build solutions to their problems with costs of their product proportional to the labor costs of the regions in which they happen to live.\nABOUT US\nWe believe technology should unite and not divide us. We strive to democratize technology by simplifying it so that innovation happens across all strata of society. Our vision will be realized when any sized company, from enterprise to a small business owner, or even a single person with a yen to create, can innovate solutions to their problems. Ferdon - the maker of Qmodeler is its headquartered in Vietnam where all its employees live. Ferdon understands well the challenges facing developing countries\nWHAT IS A BOARD GAME, A TURING COMPLETE LANGUAGE, AND THE SUBJECT OF HUNDREDS OF RESEARCH PAPERS\nIt would be easy mistakenly assume that QModeler generates code from the graphs users create but that would not be correct. The graph used by the users is itself a turning complete languages. QModeler relies on Pebbling that is at once a board game, a topic of hundreds of research papers; and a Turing complete \"languages\". More about this technology. Listen the the video below by the founder of QModeler to learn more\n\nMARLOW COMARISON\nSince we are often compared with Marlow I wanted to point out some important differences. Also please watch the above video to understand the unique functionality of QModeler that wedon't have room to describe here.\n\nTargeted Demographics -QModeler targets the\"Citizen Programmer\" who has little or no technical training. Marlow uses blocky which was intended to teach programming. Our own usability tests as well as others shows Blockly is too complex for \"Citizen Programmers\". More on citizen programmers :https://tinyurl.com/4z33rx8r .\nGreater Flexibility - Components must be flexible enough to allow Citizen Programmers freedom to build what they want. For instance in the blocky program I may want to take half the amount in escrow, I may want to pay the arbitrator 10% of the funds for incentivization, I may want to wait until all bids are in and select the highest bidder. To me the components in Marlow look like they were built by working back from the demos.\nDoes Not Use Code Generation - Code generation is an approach with a 15 year history of failure by companies like IBM and Microsoft. Generated code is error prone. Blockly is built on code generation,\nEasy Process for Building Components - It must be very easy to build a new component. Users will find use cases that are not handled by existing components and it must be possible to build these components quickly. Otherwise it becomes like Wordpress where you get 95% of features you want out of the box but getting the remaining 5% features may require you to abandon Wordpress.\nFormal Verification of Conformance to Business Requirements - the model should be formally verified and results displayed to the user or development will be a very slow process.

For example SOTRA operate in the laguna d'Ebrie, Cote d'Ivoire, using old boat and infrastructures where 300000 users commute daily. 30% of passengers are using small boats ( called pinasse ) runs by entrepreneurs. The pinasse owners can be on the target due to smaller amount to deploy E-ROW solution.The pontoon can be used as a HUB for recharging any electric devices, car, computers etc\n\nSoon, access and high price of fossils energies will hit hard the logistic market espiaccily in Africa where it takes sometimes weeks to obtain diesel.\n\nThis is a short example on a million miles navigable waterways worldwide\n\n \n\nUsing Cardano as an additional module will :\n\n \n\n- Secure investor by avoiding cash\n- Track number of users\n- Reward the entrepreneurs and end users\n- Give the first step for blockchain into inland transportations\n\nUsing Cardano will simply connect both parties and make payment easy, cheap and quick between franchises and the E-ROW Corp ( Switzerland based).\n\nTo deploy this project you will find below the different stages :\n\n- Finalize the government grant with the French Treasury and the REPIC Switzerland ( 3 months already working with them )\n\n- Analyze the environment to set up the turbine, engine swap and entrepreneur training ( 2 months )\n\n- Organize the payment method using CARDANO as a standard for purchasing ticket, franchising fees. Mobile payment is already in the mindset locally ( 2 weeks )\n\n- Connecting the smart pontoon to the Cardano network ( don't know how long it gonna take yet...)\n\n \n\nIt will take approximately 6 months to set up the entire project 2 months more for larger project.\n\nThe objective for E-ROW is to focus public transportation such as SOTRA etc but smaller project for 20 PAX boats is underway and easier to finance with huge amount spent on green projects.\n\nUsing ADA to replace the CFA Franc can be a tricky especially for us due to financial regulation but using it as a token and franchisee fees is much easier at this time.\n\nTo dig deeper into blockchain, we are in contact with SMART AFRICA specialized in telecommunications ( and others activities) all around Africa with Key person to set up our transaction modele. They have already a great knowledge with mobile payment and infrastructure.\n\nAlso working with SA will simply the organisation of this payment also using their engineers to set up this type of payment. Working with African corporate is a must.\n\nThe amount requested will be used primarily for human resources and a smaller portion for hard ware around 80/20%\n\nOnce the first projects on, we can deploy to other countries with the help of the African bank for development. We can easily have for the first 6 months 50K persons using our service monthly and increase 30%-40% every months.\n\nThis Project is manage by Frédéric Olenczak,studied multimodal river transport at the university and worked in different companies such as public river transport in Bordeaux with their hybrid catamaran.\n\nThank you\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351403-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351380-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351263-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1SpEgV3UtHPcLJXk6BqHxtXNjXQs5_zed8ZirrYlw0HI/edit\n\n","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/351134-48088"},{"content":"\n\nDetailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\n\nLook at my personal website for the building blocks of this grand vision.\nhttps://www.dharmagardener.ca\nWho am I besides the guy that wants to garden, provide for his family, and change to a better state?\nI want to take altruistic, holistic, natural solutions worldwide through Decentralized App & payments via ADA, other native verifiable tokens, and any other method of honorable trade.\nREQUEST: development help!\nSpecifically, to create a browser extension, with video clips and tipping for good deeds/planted seeds.\nUtilizing cardano wallets/smart contracts thru such a DApp, I want to link Earth Polluters (carbon offsets/credits/tokens) to Earth Protectors (worldwide gardeners/tree planters/conservationists)\nAnd essentially, we would be able to pay people to live healthy; to grow their own food, biodiversify their landscape, reconnect with nature, create climate resiliency, heal the planet, and offer a legacy of hope (seeds & seeds of change).\nHealthy human economy, of benefit to all.\nAnd with the seeds Charles' birds have been planting in Africa, this could be the altruistic clincher of assured users across the continent.\nTHIS is the essential thesis for why I have applied to have my project proceed in F5: Grow Africa, Grow Cardano Challenge.\nSalesman (either real world person, or virtual): \"Hey buddy, want to sign up for a cardano wallet?

We welcome the Cardano community to join with us in introducing a brand new industry called Sanitation Microfarming(tm)Proved By Cryptography (PBC).\nWe are introducing our plan to farm insects called black soldier fly larvae, detritivores that are the most efficient consumers of bio waste, inside our patent pending invention called the D-Lavatory (D-Lav for short). Picture included below, the D-Lav houses these creatures inside a carefully constructed, ergonomic designed device that takes the place of pit latrines, water wasting flush toilets and the widespread practice of open defecation in Africa. The human waste deposited is biotransformed by detritivore consumption into animal feed, soil amendments and medicinal items that give what is usually considered worthless a value of about $1 per pound. People from richer nations we call \"Giftprenuers\" donate the D-Lav units to families in need via 501c3 entities we have partnered with, thus giving them the ability to claim a tax deduction for assisting needy people. Local Khepera representatives in Ethiopia where we plan to roll out first, will come to a family home and set them up with the detritivores and the biochar used to absorb urine for the creation of new soil. Twice a month the locally employed workers come back to retrieve the products, recording everything via a Cardano blockchain based app. The home owner has the same app and when the product is sold will know exactly how much her family contributed as well as market and sales information. When product is sold the revenue will come into the system as Cardano based token Khepera Coin, and be automatically distributed to all stake holders via smart contract, including the Giftprenuers, who receive a free will (and in the USA tax free) gift of a revenue share generated by the D-Lav and its related Resource Based Economy. All Giftprenuers can receive up to half their rev share in the form of any crypto they prefer, creating an economic force for all crypto investors to positively push the value of their coin of choice, while making Africa better for all the children. Blockchain enthusiasts concerned with the carbon footprint of the technology can help to fight global warming by supporting this effort, because Sanitation Microfarming (tm) mitigates methane, a green house gas that arises from decaying matter that is dozens of times more potent than regular CO2.(Giftprenuers get a special NFT denoting how much methane they helped mitigate!) We will also be introducing larger scale projects that mimic biological climates in enclosed spaces (invented by our NASA scientist Richard Nelson-info graphics included below). These buildings, with D-Lavs inside, are excellent for safe, sanitary public relief - replacing dangerous fly and mosquito infested pit latrines. Another is for safe sanitary childbirth, which is available to only 15 percent of women in the Global South. These buildings, called the SaniPOD and BirthPOD, also utilize the nutrients from the biotransformed waste to grow flowers and food crops, creating a pleasant environment inside as well as a source of nutrition for places often suffering from food insecurity.\nWe plan to spend the funds we are seeking to hire techs to create the blockchain infrastructure (apps, NFTs and smart contracts), manufacture and gift D-Lavs to several hundred families, create the local logistical structure and fund administration. Feel free to take a look at the infographics included, as well as the full \"brown paper\" we have included for a much more comprehensive look. Please be advised the paper was written before we knew about the Cardano blockchain, so ignore any other chains mentioned. And also please be advised that we have a famous Hollywood actor/director as part of our team who is gearing up to produce a documentary of our endeavors. (this is not a part of this budget.) His name is Bill Duke (director of Hoodlum and Deep Cover) and he thinks our efforts can become a celebrity cause - so look out!\nPlease consider joining us as we uplift Africa and introduce the ultimate crypto use case on the Cardano blockchain.\n\n \n\nDetailed Implementation Plan For Sanitation Microfarming (tm) PBC\n\nStep1:\n\nContract Cardano's tech services group IOHK for creation of blockchain assets: Khepera coin, smart contracts, product proof NFT system and integration with payment services to receive and fiat and turn local currency into crypto currency. Expected cost -$30,000\n\nStep 2: Work with Cardano to build relations with Ethiopian government and universities. Build local Khepera infrastructure in Ethiopia's major city Addis Abba:\n\nSolaroof Work Village work complex\n\n-3 self powered buildings for black soldier fly and worm breeding and D-Lavatory product processing, a building for food, water and energy creation and a building for Khepera tech force training/administration. Expected cost 3 of Solaroof buildings plus insect processing equipment - $40,000\n\nStep 3: Chinese manufacture of 200 D-Lav units, 2 SaniPOD buildings and 1 BirthPOD complex. Expected cost -$20,000 for 200 D-Lavs, $10,000 for 2 SaniPODS and $10,000 for 1 childbirth equipped BirthPOD complex including separate family RecoveryPOD - $40,000 step 3 total\n\nKhepera local Tech force training (20 Ethiopian individuals), 2 American staff member travel, room and board plus administration costs for 6 month pilot program expected costs - $40,000\n\nWhat success looks like:\n\n3 months after funding – Ethiopian region and local home users and tech force participants chosen from local Addis Abba University students, first Solaroof training facility built, training locals begins and basic design of dapps started\n\n6 months after funding is the Expected Public Launch Date\n\nAll dapps and Solaroof facilities created, home based D-Lavs distributed along with dapps, begin 6 month Sanitation Microfarming pilot in city of Addis Ababa and in a nearby villiage.\n\n(we believe our cooperative can be especially helpful with Ethiopia's village program mentioned here:\n\n( https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-landrights-towns-idUSL8N1NS3FE))\n\nAnd to really get what the Cardano/Khepera partnership could accomplice not only in Ethiopia but all over Africa where our small thriving villages could be developed here is a word from Khepera's CTO Richard Nelson - former NASA scientist and inventor of Solaroof and advocate for the Cardano blockchain and ecosystem:\n\n\"Let's think about the structure of the blockchain contract between the village the villagers and the government. Let's take the people out of the prison of commodity wealth where their prosperity is measured in terms of production of the product valued by International commodity markets. Let's reward the people for their independent off-grid lifestyle which produces zero tax burden to the government in fact offers the government a share in the Commonwealth of the people.\n\nThe people are not urbanizing. Quite the opposite; the people are restoring tribal community with its security and prosperity for all members. They have invested their money in technology that provides a high quality of life and an abundance of life support, meaning significant surplus of: fresh organic local food, pure water, clean energy and many other secondary products that naturally generate from the living ecosystem of the Khepera SolaRoof Village.\n\nThe Villagers do not have their hands out for their share of a distributed money payment from the government - their lives are not creating a tax burden upon others. They do not need Fiat money to prove the value of their lives of independent dignity that is based upon the abundance inherently present in the healthy natural environment that is sustained around and within the community. Give the community cryptocurrency reward and recognition that can be exchanged for Fiat money as maybe needed. The great wealth generated by the thriving rural Village Life can provide the services to uplift the urban slum dwellers out of poverty.\"\n\n12 months after funding – Successful tweeking of dapps, logistics and all Sanitation Microfarming components to assure viable large scale rollout - including expected Profitability and Cardano giveback:\n\nThe Khepera brown paper forecasts that the average city dwelling family in Africa using the Khepera Sanitation Microfarming system, working with local Tech Force, will generate $15,000 yearly in revenue per family. During the 6 month pilot in Ethiopia's capital city the 200 families will generate approximately $1.5 million in product revenue. The publicly used SaniPOD and BirthPOD will bring in about $250,000 in revenue from the sales of biotransformed product from sanitation.\n\nKhepera SCA will write into a smart contract the facility to put the granted $150,000 back into the Project Catalyst funding program from product revenue, along with another $150,000 for a total of $300,000 in ADA to be given back for the sake of others seeking funding.\n\nWorld wide publicity – which will be aided by the documentary created by the world famous director Bill Duke, which is a separately funded project. Note on Bill Duke by Greg Walker:\n\nI was so honored that my friend Bill Duke, one of the most respected people in Hollywood, volunteered to assist with the promotion of Khepera. Solaroof tech and our blockchain endeavors. It was Bill who brought up creating a documentary based on our rollout in Ethiopia, not me. This man will work wonders for our cooperatives efforts worldwide to make the world a better place. (image of Khepera SCA founder Greg Walker and director Bill Duke in skype meeting attached)\n\nKhepera will then conduct our Giftprenuer driven Tokenized Founding Member Offer (TFMO)as described on page 27 of the included Khepera brown paper. Then the Sanitation Microfarming cooperative will expand to the rest of East Africa, then across the entire Global South over the next 6 years as outlined in the paper, bringing the Cardano blockchain to billions of users.\n\nSupporting paper, staff\n\nidentifying info and images attached","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350781-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nPurpose of the Project Proposal\n\nResponding to the immense opportunities West Africa presents for Cardano blockchain adoption and the continent's well-documented barriers to adoption of cutting edge digital solutions, the proposers of this project, West Africa Decentralized Alliance (WADA), seek to start entrenching Cardano's cutting-edge solutions in the West Africa sub region.\nOur aim is to accelerate the creation of dapps and attract new developers into the Cardano ecosystem who are attuned to solving local problems.\n\nOur alliance have identified four areas of focus that would help the best ground solutions to emerge:\n- Infrastructure (main purpose of this proposal)\n- Education\n- Development\n- Outreach\n\nBy supporting and developing these activities, WADA will, thanks to its role as link between people and initiatives, help to simplify and boost the creation and deployment of innovative solutions in all West African countries.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nAs with the Cardano ecosystem in general, in Africa there are parallel threads that need to be working simultaneously. First and foremost among them are the basic infrastructure needs that many in the western world take for granted, but are often things that African localities do not commonly have available at a level that will support the development of such a highly technical ecosystem.\nInternet access that will support inter-hub and international cyber-meetings as well as stake-pool operations is something that must be pursued and acquired. Electrical supply with UPS integration and backup generators is also something that must be secured as local power companies are often subject to brownouts/blackouts.\nIn addition to those basic needs are also the hardware required to support developers, teachers, students and the associated community outreach each hub is planning.\n\nThe following list in details what should be standard equipment and services for our community hubs:\n- Facility – (Rental / Maint.)\n- Power – (Equipment/Installations/Rental/Fuel/Maintenance)\n- Internet – (adequate for world communication and stake pool operation)\n- Networks – (Equipment/Installations/Rental/Subscription)\n- Insurance - (Safety / Fire / Hazards)\n- Workstations connected to screens for classes, printers, etc.\n- Desks, tables, chairs\n\nThe funds requested for the support of the hubs (investment costs + 3 months recurring costs) will be administered by WADA and will be made available to the individual hubs according to a phased deployment plan designed to bring all hubs to the same functionality simultaneously. Partner hubs are people with whom we have developed a relationship over the last few months and with whom we share the same goals.\n\nBudget: 125 695$\n\n(Detailed budget in attached documents)\n\nImplementation roadmap/Success Indicators\n\nSignificant Cardano market expansion in all current and future WADA-active countries through solutions design/ dApp creation, education & outreach, and continuous capacity/capability building. WADA will have a network of hubs or centers in sub-Saharan Africa connected locally, nationally and globally to Cardano and the digital world economy :\n\n• 1-3 months post funding\nSeven local fit- for-purpose physical spaces acquired throughout West and Central Africa with internet access, stable electricity, and computers\n\n• 4-6 months post funding\nThe local hubs/centres are up and running under competent leadership. Each hub is uniquely delivering according to the needs and opportunities of their communities. Organizing recurring events, education in functional programming and blockchain technology (for all ages) and community outreach and events.\n\n• 6 months to one year\n- Hubs are fully functional and specialized to serve local and national needs\n- Hubs are networked with other international hubs to leverage each other's strengths, share learning, and increase accountability.\n- All WADA planned activities to expand Cardano's market in sub-Saharan Africa such as government and academic outreach, dApp creations/business solutions, and creative enterprises in full implementation\n- Collaborative projects with other projects in the Cardano ecosystem are being executed seamlessly on the ground.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nAs part of our risk assessment process, we identified 3 main areas that require specific attention :\n- 1. Legalization: some African administrations are strong in harassing new businesses.\n- 2. Coordination/standards.\n- 3. Cost over-run.\n\nThe possible risk management solutions:\n\n1. Legalization:\n- Obtain a legal document from which the WADA hubs would be operating. With numerous trade agreements overlapping, a copy of this document can be used for operations anywhere.\n- Set up new hubs in existing offices or close to a partner developer's office. This would not only give legitimacy in the eyes of potential users, but government officials will not easily distinguish the new business as it will be collaborating with the established one.\n- Crypto currencies are unregulated in many countries, WADA will ensure adherence to local regulation to any extent possible\n\n2. Coordination/standards:\n- Issue standards common to each partner hubs.\n- Hire the services of local lawyers. Laws in many African countries are relatively similar with standards such as OHADA (Organisation for the Harmonisation of Corporate Law in Africa).\n- Identification stickers to put on all material goods so as to establish ownership. A shared logo, paint and color themes can help ensure the motivation of participants who need to not only see themselves as members of one small hub but members of one large network. These standards will be visually visible through video calls.\n- The coordinating team must be physically aware of the experience on the ground. At least a visit mid-project to each hub. Ideally, the same person/team would visit all hubs to establish a common assessment.\n\n3. Cost over-runs\n- Starting a new business/office has unexpected costs. This needs to be taken into account.\n- Additional to forming new hubs, also find an established business dealing with programming and digital products to partner with.\n- Actors would need to be compensated. For example, the coordination team. But also, the \"lead\" of each hub, even if it is a business owner. These costs can be symbolic and need not cover the full extend of their involvement as they are either already interested or employed. This will ensure that their keep their focus on the hub.\n- To ensure functionality, cost items must be arranged in order of priority. We do not want to have bought laptops and printers only to find that there is no money for the office. Ideally, the ranking will ensure that the office can maintain some level of functionality.\n\nLaunching time: Q2 2021\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn addition to the elements related to infrastructure, WADA will also continue to work on the other pillars identified by the community:\n- Education\n- Development\n- Outreach\n\nMore information on our education, development, outreach goals and hubs leads can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NaGdNkWo-n-yCBKBmu0_LL0Q5Ca_gedoWXB7xEq2v80/edit?usp=sharing\n\nCollaboration with other projects\n\n• https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Local-Centers-in-West-Africa/340029-48088\n• https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/No-Code-For-Creative-Africa/351502-48088\n• https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Indigenous-Source/352747-48088\n• https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Devs-for-Awarenes-Event-West-Africa/350652-48088","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350764-48088"},{"content":"","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350742-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nVision\nBy creating the first Cardano stake pool in Ethiopia, we will plant a seed to help grow the local Cardano development community. We will demonstrate the power of Cardano by generating tangible returns which will in turn pave the way for others. We will lower the barrier to entry by serving as a local source of first-hand knowledge and Ada liquidity.\n\nUPDATE 4-23-2021: The plan has been updated to run the stake pool in ETHIOPIA on local hardware. Initially it will be on a small server based in a local office, but later we will transition to a true data center in Addis Ababa.\n\nDevelopment Roadmap\n\nPhase 1: Within the first month of funding, setup the stake pool on Local Hardware in Addis Ababa, and then for the next 5 months focus on promoting the pool to garner sufficient delegated stake.\nPhase 2: When the first commercial data centers open in Ethiopia, move the stake pool nodes to a local data center (approximately 2-3 years from now; the first data center is under construction now at the ICT Park)\nThe stake pool fees and rewards generated will be used to create a treasury. The treasury will sustain the operations of the stake pool indefinitely into the future (pay local network, electricity bills, etc). If the treasury can support it, we will also fund additional local Cardano-related ventures. While promoting our stake pool, we will also promote Cardano and Project Catalyst to developers, entrepreneurs, and investors in Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Diaspora around the world.\nWe are now working together with other local Catalyst proposers who are focused specifically on promoting Cardano and Catalyst in Addis Ababa. Their efforts will help to promote our stake pool to local investors as well as show the developer community what is possible via Project Catalyst.\n\nInternship Program\n\nOur stake pool will initially be run by Nebiyou, but we plan to train local developers and students from Addis Ababa University, and offer them paid internships to do the day-to-day operation of the stake pool nodes (software updates, server maintenance, etc.), as well as to assist with digital marketing and other tasks. This internship will give them valuable hands-on experience so that they will then be able to start their own Cardano projects (maybe more stake pools!) in the future. It will also allow the proposers to focus on other Catalyst projects and networking in Addis Ababa.\n\nMeasures of Success\n\nAfter 3 Months: Cardano Stake Pool running in Addis Ababa\nAfter 6 months: Number of local jobs created\n\nAfter 1 year: Number of Cardano-related projects funded from our treasury and the number of new community members who are attracted to Cardano thanks to the promotion of our stake pool.\n\nBudget for 6 months:\n\nStake: $12,000\nInternet connection: $500\nHardware: $500\nAdvertising: $1000\nStaff salary: $5,000 (to hire local staff/interns to dedicate time to the promotion and operation of the stake pool until it is generating sufficient fees and rewards to be self-sustaining)\n\nExpected Launch Date: July 30, 2021 or earlier (when we expect the stake pool to be running and ready for delegation)\n\nTeam Bios\n\nMearaf Tadewos is a Mobile Application Engineer and Full-Stack developer at FloCash (payment service provider).

DeFi is limited to yield farming. Let's empower individuals to lift their community and build their own future.\nCrypto lending circles are the solution, community powered self lending. No more shady business with banks and no more 100+% collateral on DeFi protocols.\nThis is already helping immigrants and those in developing countries but limited to small amounts due to low income communities. 24.4K for a prototype to scale the pooled money limit and reach users across the world potentially capturing a $6 billion market.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDetailed problem\n2.5 Billion adults around the world are unbanked. They are concentrated in developing nations where very little regulation exists for central banks. Paired with corruption, banks engage in predatory lending [1], fraud, and plain abuse[3][4].\nIn developed nations, the bank's profits model protects profit margins not people. Along with fraud [5], borrowers are tricked into unfair terms [6].\nCurrent DeFi protocols are reduced to yield farming for those with disposable income. Finance is not truly accessible for anyone.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nDetailed solution\nBy cooperatively saving and taking turns loaning out the money, members get anything from a low interest loan to a high interest savings account.\nKnown formally as a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA). The concept has been practiced for decades successfully[7] (used by %23 of Mexico) and is known by 200 different names across the world.Women in Kenya,Mexico, Bangladesh and all over the world successfully use this at the scale of a local community [8][9][10].\nKitty Party will use the Cardano platform to scale this solution to the global stage.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat success looks like\nShort term (1-2 years):\n\nThe ability to provide under collateralized loans (or zero collateral) group lending will attract people outside of the crypto space out of necessity. Bringing new people onto the Cardano platform and keeping them with solutions that solves real world problems.\nCapturing 1% of the current DeFi lending market yields $67 Million translating to about 70,000 active users.\n\nLong term:\n\nBringing product to the vulnerable population from developed to underdeveloped nations. With IOHK's involvement in Africa, we would want to provide Kitty Party as a tool for the population.\nHaving non-technical users benefiting from the platform: ie. Dimitri would like to grow his farming operation but needs $30,000 to purchase equipment. He can save $1000 a month for 30 months or join Kitty Party and receive his required funds and kickstart his upgrade earlier..\nMake the world a better place. People are able to lift themselves out of hard financial situations or shoot for their dreams with community powered lending.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe road ahead\nDealing with fraud and virtual identities:\n\nEach wallet will have to develop credit in the system (ie. cant start off with a $1M stake group). Individuals will build trust starting with low stake groups.\nMembers will also be matched with other that have similar financial needs\nUsing 'Know you customer' (KYC) processes users will only be allowed one wallet which can be blacklisted due to fraudulent behaviour\nMembers will be able to build trust faster if they are able to use cosigners within the same jurisdiction legally binded using OpenLaw.\n\nFor Catalyst F5 we are seeking funding to build a prototype ready for alpha testing. Current team size is one and will be utilizing contractors/freelancers for peripheral work.\n \nAfter product market fit has solidified we will continue expansion.\n \nTotal funds requested: $24,400 estimated for 6 months of development\nBreakdown:\n\nUX design - $3000\nWeb application first iteration build - $8000\nSmart contract + tokenomics design - $9000\nSecurity review first iteration - $3000\nContingency - $1400\n\nTimeline:\n\n3 months - skeleton of web application and smart contract system built. Ready for internal refinement.\n6 months - version 0 ready for closed alpha testing (n=100)\nWith early product validation, seek funding for formal verification and stress testing\n\nDeliverables:\n\nWeekly updates on progress.\nForum for consulting community on designs.\nWeb app + smart contract Prototype ready for early access in 6 months\n\nBy January 2022 we will have the first round of closed alpha testing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nExperience\nTechnical Co founder for 4 years bringing concept to market.\nIntegration operations lead for national mortgage insurers for 2 years.\n7 years of full stack software engineering\nCurrently following plutus pioneer program\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/qimran-ahmed/\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWant to discuss?

There will also be lots of DeFi users looking for a place to trade new tokens as well as support their favorite projects. This is the premise of MinSwap - a multi-pool automated market maker. What is multi-pool, anyway? It means that there can be multiple pricing functions for one single pair, for example constant-product function, StableSwap invariant, Kyber's DMM function, etc. The trading interface will compute and route to the most efficient pools.\n\n \n\nFeatures\nFair Launch: No pre-mine, no pre-sale.

It was caused by simultaneous NFT projects launches that highly increased transactions traffic in the network.\n\n \n\nTo build a more decentralized solution, we basically face 2 problems:\n- It's actually a challenging task to setup every available Cardano API and deal with its updates\n- In addition, there is a lack of incentives for operators to deal with these challenges.\n\n \n\nThere is also a need to build this network along with a reputation system based on availability and performance metrics that can be used and trusted by API consumers to choose the most suitable deployment for them.\n\n \n\n \n\nReferences\n\n \n\n[0] \"If we don't stop relying on Infura, the vision of ethereum failed\" https://www.coindesk.com/the-race-is-on-to-replace-ethereums-most-centralized-layer\n[1]\n\n\nDETAILED PROPOSED SOLUTION\n\nDesired Outcome\n\n \n\nThe desired outcome for this proposal is to take to the next level the original \"Cardano API as a Community Service\", which was merged into Gimbalabs and voted as winner on fund2.\nDandelion free community service has facilitated bootstrapping more than ten projects since the beginning of Fund2 such like:\n\n \n\n- SpaceBudz [0]\n- AdaBoost Cardano Calendar [1]\n- lift-wallet [2]\n- raywallet [3]\n- MONAD's pool network observability tool [4]\n- Blocktales interactive book [5]\n- Cryptomayor NFT portal [6]\n- LacedWhales Twitter bot [7]\n- Cardano Metadata Viewer by Icaro Capobianco [8]\n- Development courses where it was used as learning resource (ADOPT [9] and PoA [10] dev courses)\n- Maybe others use it silently, we preserve privacy :)\n\n \n\nNow these and many others are in stages where they might be in the need of backing services that support their production workload, it would be nice to start building this market offer in a standardized way so projects could easily switch between deployments or just spread their load.\n\n \n\nThe plan is to nurture a network by developing the tools needed to ease the deployment and maintenance and to incentivize SPOs (the most natural builders for it) or any other operator by having an easy way to monetize such services using Cardano native assets.\n\n \n\n \n\nSolution overview\nWe'll focus on building further the technology required to make Dandelion a self-servicing API where any consumer can buy and employ Cardano native assets as master key to access the backing service.\nThe piece of software that makes this possible has been proposed independently in Fund5 metadata challenge [11] as a generic blockchain authorization mechanism and we'll be integrating it into Dandelion for the purpose described below.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, to enable API consumers to choose the most suitable deployment, such distributed network of API deployments will require a trustable reputation system, so we'll start an in-depth research to build this solution.\nIn addition, we'll be launching a campaign within the SPOs community to bootstrap the network/market with as many deployments as possible.\n\n \n\nWe, of course, will keep offering support from Gimbalabs' discord server [12] about the usage, deployment and maintenance of these services and improving the Infrastructure as Code templates (kustomize-dandelion [13]), updating them to support latest service versions and including new ones like blockfrost's [14], plutus-pab or ipfs-cluster (we've already started integrating [15]) that help projects adopt the decentralized revolution on top of Cardano in a friendly manner.\n\n \n\n \n\n3 months roadmap tentative\n- Setup staging environments and maintain 2 different production versions to help projects handle migrations\n- Deploy on our behalf in at least 1-2 new locations to provide a minimal level of redundancy to the network\n- Look for SPO candidates to deploy on extra locations\n- Start promoting the initiative inside and outside Cardano community by writing proper documentation and storytelling\n- Integrate the Fund5 proposal work on an authorization mechanism based on Cardano native assets\n- Start researching and planning an MVP for the reputation system\n\n \n\n \n\nCosts estimates\nWe identify that to push the initiative to the next level, we'll need at least 4 dedicated roles:\n\n \n\n- 1 Technical Project Lead position that takes ownership of the product development and leads integrations ($2000/mo x3 months: $6000)\n- 1 Systems administrator/DevOps advocate that takes ownership of the community service deployments and helps developing the opensource projects ($2000/mo x3 months: $6000)\n- 1 Community Manager position that starts building the brand in social media ($1000/mo x3 months: $3000)\n- 1 Technical \"CEO\" (the proposer) that helps building/leading and looks after for business sustainibility ($1000/mo x3 months: $3000)\n\n \n\nThen we also identify these other budgets:\n\n \n\n- Budget for operational costs for at least 2-3 locations and different versions for the community service, including staging environments (3x deploys $500/mo x3 months: $4500)\n- Budget to help some experienced SPOs to bootstrap their own deploy (3x deploys $300/mo x3 months: $1800)\n\n \n\nTotal estimate: $24300 for a 3 months period.\n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual Property\nEvery

of actual forest and the attributes of the land in the metadata. The NFTs will airdrop/produce carbon credits(CO2 Tokens) for the holders of the NFTs.\n\n \n\nLike Kickstarter in a way, a land owner decides how much they will take in exchange for putting forest into 100 year trust, and either the total is reached and the land is put into Carbonland Trust, or if it fails and then the landowner could decide if they will take less and accept whatever as been raised during campaign(NFTs sold). If they wont accept less the funds are returned to those that reserved and the landowner can try again in the future if they like.\n\n \n\nFor Carbonland Trust a DEX provides ways we can lower cost for the legal aspects of our land trusts, and provide all stakeholders digital assets(NFTs)(CarbonCredits) that can be confirmed on a blockchain.\nIt is hard to say for sure but probably millions of people will engage with Carbonland Trust to save forest and offset carbon in the future. Forest preservation is one of the most popular philanthropic and volunteer related causes. And there is a massively growing interest in climate action, co2 sequestration, and carbon credits. If our Land Trust Tiles(NFTs) and CO2 credits(Fungible Token) were native assets on Cardano it would be powerful use case for the ecosystem.\n\n \n\nThe reason I think we need something like Carbonland Trust is many of the forest conservation and carbon credit programs are not really doing it with the best intentions. Some companies that are getting money for carbon credits like logging company's that plan on cutting down the trees as soon as its marketable timber and only taking part in carbon credits to get money until they do cut down the forest, no plans on protecting the forest longterm.\nThat is why Carbonland Trust is a 100 year lock period and land management is focused on maintaining those lands with permaculture and regenerative conservation practices.\n\n \n\nCO2 rules are already being proposed by governments all over, and the voluntary carbon markets are taking off. And many businesses and people want to do conservation efforts and work towards reducing pollution. And since nations and businesses are already taking upon themselves to make this mainstream, we should be part of those conversations and efforts to use blockchain to make sure at least it really is benefiting people in the longterm and bring transparency to the carbon marketplace.\n\n \n\nThe carbon credits market and permaculture focused conservation efforts can be something good for us all. And could be a powerful use case for Cardano :)\n\n \n\nAlso Carbonland Trust NFTs offer timeshare like opportunities for holders of the NFTs to visit the forest land they have helped preserve. And our NFTs will also be used in virtual land where people will be able to play a game similar of Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.\n\n \n\nPlease visit the website and see this pitch deck for more info and visit the website\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1moXRsokFs6udwfxeazQ3_pTuNgz6j_CYRapuvisXohk/\nRequesting $9000.

As soon as Ergo and Cardano share a similar eUTXO model in their core, ErgoDEX contracts and all its ecosystem (UI, bots) can be relatively easily ported to Cardano.\n\nBackground: ERGO\n\nErgo was founded by Charles Hoskinson's \"favorite technologist\" Alex Chepurnoy who contributed to the development of Cardano, co-founded smartcontract.com (now Chainlink) and was a core developer at Nx, the first Proof-of-Stake chain. In an interview, Hoskinson described Ergo as;\n\"It's one of the most revolutionary cryptocurrencies ever built. Got so many crazy ideas like sigma protocols and pruning the blockchain and roller chains. All this crazy stuff. Even has proof of no premine. So really a technological marvel in many respects, and it reflects about 8 years of knowledge that Alex has amassed as both a researcher and a developer. Super concise code and it blows my mind that the market cap is where it's at. It should be a top 10 coin or top 15 coin\" — Charles Hoskinson\nErgo is one of a very exclusive group of blockchains that had no premine, ICO or VC funding. Built with fairness in mind. While developers are starting to appear, access to funds would allow us to hire more UI devs, and create a more robust and tested system in time for Alonso.\n\nCurrent state of ErgoDEX\n\nErgoDEX protocol is described in EIP14 (https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/eip14/eip-0014.md) and will be fixed as standard DEX protocol for Ergo. Most contracts from the protocol are already tested in the ERGO main-net and now developers are mainly focused on delivering DEX UI, SDK and security audit of the protocol.\nUnfortunately ErgoDEX is now being developed by very few devs what makes it hard to deliver good UI and port the app to Cardano, so additional funding is required in order to attract more developers and deliver DEX in time when communities of both Ergo and Cardano need it most.\n\nUPD:\n\nAutomatic swaps against AMM pool (TestUSD -> TestERG) are tested in the mainnet:\nhttps://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/bc638795df9d5411c8213296b13f69e078c5dd0bc37bba53deedb44b29650cf7\nThe TestERG|TestUSD pool:\nhttps://api.ergoplatform.com/api/v1/boxes/unspent/byTokenId/d7d0d6ecc4ed6c282a22655da253070157b381173460a6a8f556eace1529791e\n\nTeam\n\n- Ilya Oskin (oskin1) is a Software Engineer, Core Developer of Ergo, Lead Developer at Mail.ru Group.

[Github: https://github.com/deadit]\n\nExperience\n\nIlya Oskin has a broad experience in core blockchain research and development. He previously worked as a core developer of Ergo reference node, backend developer of ErgoWallet, Ergo Blockchain Explorer, Prism (a language for financial contracts). Experienced in functional programming in Scala, Haskell.\nDmitry Usov is a frontend dev with 6+ years of experience in commercial development and 2+ years of blockchain-related development. He took part in projects like ErgoExplorer UI, AgeUSD UI (algorithmic stable coin), Ergo JS SDK.\n\nErgo->Cardano ports\n\nThis is not the first contract that will be ported to Plutus, IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo designed the economic model of AgeUSD. Its economic model maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations. Along with that, it supports a fully decentralized stablecoin emission setup. Thus, AgeUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralized UTXO stablecoin.\nThe AgeUSD contracts were also converted to Plutus, and are currently being implemented by Cardano, the original drafts of the Plutus contracts can be seen on the AgeUSD github.\n\nProposal impacts on key metrics\n\nFinally, the ErgoDEX will create the necessary conditions for expanding the audience using the Cardano protocol. Transparent tokenomics and familiar UX will allow to attract more LPs and users to Cardano DeFi. In 12 months, we expect the number of active users of the exchange to exceed 100,000 in a week.\nErgoDEX will serve to successfully implement cross-chain swaps between the Ergo ecosystem and Cardano in the future. We have a unique opportunity to test all contracts on the Ergo blockchain and successfully implement them in Cardano.\nWe expect that the LVT indicator for the first 3 months of the exchange's existence reached $ 100 million, for the next 3 months $ 300 million, and at the end of the year it will be equal to ~ $ 1 billion. This rapid growth will ensure the popularity of the Uniswap exchange.\n\nDefinition of success\n\n3 months: Successful tests of contracts on the Ergo ecosystem (already done). Ready to use version of ErgoDEX UI (AMM and OrderBook included). Successful tests of contracts on the Cardano ecosystem, which are based on solutions for Ergo;\n6 months: Conducting protocol research for cross-chain swap protocols, getting first results. Added support for concentrated liquidity in AMM;\n12 months: Cross-chain DEX implemented. ErgoDEX UI fully adapted to work with cross-chain swaps.\n\nPlan in detail\n\n1. Develop a UI for AMM first and then for OrderBook\n2. Run public tests on the Ergo blockchain. Collect and analyse feedback from community.\n3. Port tested protocol to Cardano (port contracts to Plutus)\n4. Based on already developing ErgoDEX SDK implement Javascript SDK for the Cardano. (https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-dex-sdk-js/tree/dev)\n5. Update backend services (DEX bots) in order to serve ErgoDEX on Cardano (Already implemented for Ergo: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-dex-backend))\n6. Update the DEX UI in order for it to work with both Cardano and Ergo networks\n7. Test and launch the app on Cardano\n\n \n\nFurther steps (not included in this funding proposal, probably will be funded from DEX fees)\n8. Research a protocol allowing to transfer liquidity among Ergo and Cardano networks\n9. Add the inter-chain swap protocol to ErgoDEX allowing to trade assets between two networks in a decentralized manner\nWe estimate UI development to take 3 month assuming a team of 3 UI devs working simultaneously. Core development will take less effort as soon as pretty much work is already done so far, so 2 devs for 2 month (working in parallel with the UI team). Overall estimated development time from the start of UI dev to the public launch on Cardano is 3.5 month including tests (2nd half of August 2021).\n* All code is open source under the Creative Commons license.\n\nFunding:\n\nUI development\n- 2 UI devs full time, 3 month: 30K$\n- ErgoDEX UI/UX: 10K$\n- 1 QA, 2 month: 6K$\nCore development (Port of contracts, SDK and backend update)\n- 2 devs full time, 2 month: 30K$\nManagement:\n- 1 Product Owner full time, 3 month: 15K$\n*Any remaining funds will be dedicated to a research of inter-chain Ergo-Cardano swaps protocol.\n\nLinks:\n\n- Technical protocol description: https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/eip14/eip-0014.md\n\n \n\n- Non-tech protocol overview: https://github.com/oskin1/ergo-dex/blob/master/README.md\n\n \n\n- Non-tech project presentation: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/352410/38579/download\n\n \n\n- ErgoDEX SDK: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-dex-sdk-js/tree/dev\n\n \n\n- Trustless matcher bots: https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-dex-backend","Page_URL":"https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352410-48088"},{"content":"Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details\n\nLiqwid Labs is developing an open source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interest on Cardano native assets and borrowing assets.\n\n \n\nCredmark provides decentralized financial institutions with the tools they need to lend to customers with trust and confidence outside of traditional lending mechanisms.

We propose a solution to this issue by offering an \"Account\" view on top of the (E)UTXO model of Cardano, using malleable transactions and Miner-extractable value. Thus equipped, the Cardano blockchain can offer the best of the Account model and the (E)UTXO model, beating rival blockchains on all counts.\nThis proposal impacts all of the metrics for Fund 5: Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem, and at the same time it is unlikely to directly effect any of the listed metrics, because it addresses an issue with the architecture underlying all implementation of DeFi projects on Cardano. The goal of AVOUM --taming the issues with miner extractable value-- will not by itself drive DeFi projects to Cardano, but it will make a much wider range of projects economically viable.\n \n1. Introduction\n1.1. An Auction gone wrong\nLet's imagine that Alice wants to sell a painting by her famous deceased father in an online auction. She chooses to do it through a contract on a blockchain that uses the UTXO model. The painting is worth about one million dollars, which is what the highest bidder, Bob, is ready to offer. Bob signs a transaction to purchase the painting, and waits… but instead the painting ends up being awarded to Mallory, who only paid Alice a few cents for it! What happened?\nTo interact with the auction contract, Bob's transaction had to refer to its current state, embodied in a UTXO. But what if some other user also posted a bid, that appeared before Bob's? The bid might be less than Bob's, but because it appeared before Bob's, it interacted with the contract, consuming its previous UTXO and generating a new UTXO that accounts for that new bid. Bob's transaction, referring to the old UTXO, is therefore invalid, and Bob has to sign a new transaction and wait for it to be either confirmed or rejected. But what if yet another bidder managed to get their bid in before Bob's? Then Bob must try again, in an endlessly repeated cycle, until the end of the auction arrives and his bid never made it through.\nWhat did Mallory do? She sent to the blockchain nodes a stream of transactions making bids for one cent, two cents, three cents, etc., such that the UTXO constantly changes, and changes faster than Bob or any other honest but technically unsophisticated bidder can react. Regular users wait for a couple of blocks each time to determine what the UTXO to sign a transaction against will be, but Mallory makes multiple transactions at every block, and even maintains multiple rival states of the contract so the odds that honest bidder write their transactions against a valid UTXO are very low. Mallory also watches how much Bob put down in transaction fees, and makes sure to always leave a larger tip to the nodes, so she'll be sure that they prefer her transaction to Bob's. In the end, Mallory racks up a very large bill in transaction fees: thousands of dollars worth of node tips, maybe much more, along the duration of the auction. But in the end, she manages to keep out all the other bidders, and win the auction with a ridiculously low bid. For a few thousand dollars in fees, she wins a million dollar worth asset.\nMallory can similarly run a Economic Denial-of-Service Attack (Economic DoS) to exclude rivals from any contract where she could benefit from this exclusion.\n1.2. A Market for Open-Contract Transactions is Inevitable\nAny \"open\" contract on a UTXO blockchain can be subject to the same Economic DoS: if anyone can interact with the contract, or if an existing participant can interact with it an indefinite number of times before others may react, then a sophisticated attacker can use the same technique as described above to effectively prevent any other unsophisticated participant from interacting with the contract until after it is too late.\nEven without an intentional attacker, the UTXO for heavily-used contracts will be subject to heavy contention and frequent change, such that regular non-technical users will have trouble interacting with it. They have to watch the blockchain, determine the UTXO for the contract, sign a transaction with this UTXO, wait for this transaction to either make it through or be invalidated by a rival transaction, then sign a new transaction and try again, repeating for hours on, hoping that at some point there will be a lull in the activity of that contract and their transaction will finally make it through.\nDoes that mean that open contracts on UTXO blockchains are forever reserved for use by sophisticated participants who can run a full node, watch the blockchain at high-speed, and race rival transactions in all of multiple possible worlds at the same time, in servers close enough to the nodes to matter?\nActually, no: someone sophisticated has to do this job. But if the open contract is properly structured, then this someone can be any participant in a transaction posting auction market. Then, the economically competent but technically unsophisticated user posts only have to pay a sufficient transaction fee, and the sophisticated professionals will compete with each other to be the one who effectively posts the transaction.\nA single sophisticated professional — offering his services to ensure that users' transactions get through in a timely fashion to interact with frequently changing contracts — would likely be enough to start this market. Posting a transaction then becomes fire-and-forget for regular users, and the professional will earn high fees for consistently winning the race to the UTXO. High fees will likely attract competition, until a market emerges where sophisticated users compete to earn fees from users, driving those fees down, and flooding the network with rival transactions.\nEventually, nodes would realize that they could cut out the middleman between end-users and the blockchain by running those servers directly on their mining rigs, saving a lot in fees and network traffic for everyone.\nIn the end, when the market finally reached its equilibrium, users would interact with open contracts by posting suitably malleable transactions to the blockchain, and trust that nodes would automatically substitute the most recent contract UTXO for the one they posted, thereby having the blockchain behave exactly as if it had an Account/Balance model.\n1.3. Our Approach\nWe propose to directly implement the final equilibrium state of this process, wherein nodes implement the Account/Balance view of open contract on top of the underlying UTXO model, thereby providing the best of both worlds. Short-circuiting this market evolution allows us to simplify away any intermediate API, and go straight to a simplified version that only requires additional processing by the nodes, with no additional API.\nWe thus propose to implement for the Cardano blockchain:\nA convention for contracts to accept signed malleable transactions that do not depend on the specific UTXO of the contract, with a Plutus library to implement the convention,\nAn algorithm for nodes to recognize the convention, detect what validity conditions exactly a signed transaction does or does not depend on, and automatically re-run an updated transaction with a modified contract UTXO when appropriate.\nAn optimization heuristic for nodes to optimize their earnings based on the available pool of potential transactions.\n2. Background Concepts\n2.1. UTXO Model vs Account/Balance Model\nCardano, like the first blockchain, Bitcoin, represents available assets as UTXO, which stands for Unspent Transaction Outputs: each transaction may take as inputs some UTXOs of previous transactions (which are therefrom spent and no longer UTXOs) and itself produces UTXOs, thereby transferring the assets from previous owners to new ones. Ownership is enforced by the \"locking script\" associated with each UTXO, that ensures that only the possessors of some cryptographic keys may spend the UTXO, either freely or according to some \"covenant\" that limits their ability.\nBy contrast, the first blockchain with the ability to write smart contracts, Ethereum, uses an Account/Balance model, transactions transfer assets between accounts that persist across transactions, by modifying their balances. Some accounts are simply controlled by cryptographic keys, while more elaborate accounts are controlled by \"smart contracts\" which are scripts written in the blockchain's virtual machine.\nUTXOs make it easy for participating network nodes to verify historical transactions, in parallel—whereas the Account/Balance model, at least in its naive implementation, makes playing or replaying historical transactions an essentially sequential activity. Joining the network and validating its state can therefore be done faster with UTXOs than with Account/Balance, for the same reason. UTXOs provide an all over more robust data model.\nOn the other hand, the Account/Balance model makes it much easier to interact with \"open\" contracts involving a lot of participants: a user can \"just\" sign a transaction that describes the action they want to take, and this transaction will be valid irrespective of the state of the contract when the action is taken. By contrast, with the UTXO model, the user would have to track down exactly the state of contract (its UTXO) at the time the action is to be performed to even prepare the correct transaction; but this state could change very quickly, which opens the contract users to the Economic Denial-of-Service Attack described above.\n2.2. FOMO3D and the Dark Forest\nEconomic Denial-of-Service Attacks are not mere speculation. And they are not just for UTXO blockchains. Indeed, they already happen, all the time, on the Ethereum blockchain, that uses the Account/Balance model! The most famous stories about it are the winning of the FOMO3D tontine, and the Dark Forest of front-runners for swap contracts.\nThe FOMO3D was a joke of a contract, a blockchain variant of a tontine. In a historical tontine, many participants, usually young people, put money in a pot, or left it to a careful money manager—until all the participants died but one, who then got all the money in the pot. In times and places when life expectancy was shorter than the modern world, the lone survivor might even still be young enough to actually enjoy his fortune. To adapt the concept of tontine to the blockchain, a simple mechanism was used to detect the last man standing (or then again last robot operating): anyone could add tokens to the pot at any time (above some floor contribution) and thereby become a participant; to take the tokens out, you just had to be the last one putting tokens in, with no one else having put in any tokens for the last 24 hours. Of course, some rival people were running robots to prevent anyone else from winning, by making sure to chip in a few tokens after 23 hours and 55 minutes or so, if needed. And yet, some clever person managed to steal the then million-dollar pot while rival robots were still operating. How did he do? By running an Economic Denial-of-Service Attack: he simply put money in the pot, waited for about 23 hours and 55 minutes, and then bought the entire Ethereum blockchain for 5 minutes until his rivals had been excluded long enough for him to take the money out. How did he buy the entire blockchain? With repeat copies of a transaction that paid for the entire block gas limit at a gas price advantageous to the nodes, until the 5 minutes had passed.\nIn the Dark Forest story, also on Ethereum, a person noticed a way that anyone can take tokens out of a misconstrued ERC20 token contract with a clever swap transaction. A good actor, he decided to take the tokens out before they disappear, and safeguard them for their original owners. But there are robots out there that watch all ERC20 contracts for any advantageous swap transaction and will front-run that transaction with a rival transaction executing the same swap, but to the advantage of the robot operator rather than the original arbitrageur. To make sure the rival transaction makes it in, the robot simply puts a larger gas price, as long as there is any profit in the swap large enough to justify the gas cost. And our good actor was thereby scooped by a robot, and concluded that Ethereum is a Dark Forest where you'll easily get mugged.\n2.3. The Implicit Auction for Blockchain Space\nThus, Economic Denial-of-Service Attacks already exist, and so even on Account/Balance blockchains. At the bottom of the issue, the underlying reality is that space on the blockchain is scarce. Whether limited explicitly through a conventional block size limit, a conventional gas limit, or just implicitly via the network bandwidth of the winning nodes, there is a limit on how many transactions can make it to any given block. From an economic point of view, that means that getting a transaction into a block is winning an auction.\nTherefore, the first issue, demonstrated by the FOMO3D story, is that of technical sophistication. When one participant knows how to play the transaction-posting auction correctly, when the other participants are too inept to even realize the game they're playing,\nmore technically sophisticated than others, they the sophisticated participant can run circles around the other ones and prevent them from ever getting their transactions to the blockchain, then causing their rivals to timeout and extracting any resulting value from the smart contract.\nIn the case of racing a UTXO, our solution above makes the same sophistication available to every participant, for a fee. Sophisticated professionals, typically nodes, handle the complexity for regular users, and the technical problem has been reduced down to the underlying economic problem. In the case of the FOMO3D story above, the economic problem was hidden under a very thin layer of technical sophistication. In both cases, the auction for blockchain space, previously left implicit, was made explicit: to get your transaction in, you need to bid a higher fee than your rivals—which shouldn't be a big problem if you're playing a positive sum game while they're playing a zero-sum game.\nNow, the auction for blockchain space is a first price auction, since a second price auction would be gameable by nodes. Thus, to win an auction and get their transactions in, the participants must remain active, monitor the blockchain, and carefully increase their bid with market conditions, alongside their rivals; otherwise they'll pay too much (if they reveal their actual maximum bid too early), or they'll fail to get in (if they fail to raise the price to their maximum bid). There is still some sophistication required on the side of the participant: not technical sophistication, but economic sophistication. Posting transactions is still not fire-and-forget: users must keep watching the blockchain, check whether their transaction went through, and if not, sign a new variant of the transaction with a higher fee and watch again (and be ready to be surprised in case their old transaction made it through after all). This matters a lot whenever there is a deadline to sending transactions, which is almost always the case when writing robots that automate participation to some DApps.\nTo go back to our illustrating example, the FOMO3D story, \"all\" the tontine-participating robots had to do to keep playing their chicken game was to match and slightly outbid the fees posted by the attacker for one block. Indeed, to win the pot, the attacker had to win the auction for each and every block for the entire duration of the attack, whereas the defenders would only have had to win one single block. Since there were about 20 blocks in those five minutes, they could have let him buy fifteen entire blocks before they outbid him, making it a dear lesson no would-be attacker would forget. Defending successfully would have been an order of magnitude less costly than the attack. It would have been yet another order of magnitude less costly if they had started their transactions an hour in advance rather than waited until just five minutes before the deadline. Or if the blockchain had had ten times as much throughput. In general, defenders against Economic DoS attacks are at an advantage and attackers are at a disadvantage—but only if they play the game correctly. With economically rational and technically correct robots, the attacker would stand no chance. But that in itself is the topic for a separate project.\n2.4. Node Extractable Value\nThe second issue, demonstrated by the \"Dark Forest\" story, is that in a sophisticated-enough market, the nodes will extract the value that is theirs. And this value comprises the fees that a transaction is worth paying for, as well as any profit that can be made by rewriting malleable transactions to their profit. This includes changing the name of the beneficiary of a single-transaction arbitrage—a zero-sum game where the user loses—as well as inserting the latest UTXO in a transaction to extract a fee—a positive-sum game where the user wins. In doing so, they are not being evil in one case and good in the other, they are just playing the game competently, as designed.\nSuper-competent nodes might even loosely collude with each other to squeeze higher transaction fees from users who fail to tip their transactions sufficiently when they have a short deadline. This collusion in practice will be counterbalanced by the interest of the node to defect from the cartel and accept the lower fee for themselves, rather than help another node collect the higher fee. But the more concentrated the mining power, the more the nodes should cooperate to raise fees. However, this is speculation for a distant future.\nOur present project is to build the engine for nodes to play the positive-sum game where nodes and users win as the users' transactions get posted.\n3. Work to be done under this Proposal\nFor the purpose of this proposal, we estimate that each full-time qualified hire will cost MuKn approximately $15,000.00 per month, that each half-time qualified hire will cost $7,500.00 per month, and each quarter-time qualified hire will cost $3,750.00 per month.\n3.1. Step 1, for Catalyst Fund 5: Proof of Concept for Malleability in Plutus\nThe first step for this project is to write a simple \"open\" contract, in a style that allows for malleable transactions where a UTXO can be substituted for another. The work can be described as follows:\nImplement a contract for a simple first-price open-bid auction.\nThe contract shall be implemented on top of the Plutus DApp framework, or as small a slight modification thereof as necessary.\nThe contract transactions should be malleable so that it remains valid when the UTXO changes because someone else made a bid.\nWe will provide a function to tweak the posted transaction to adapt it to a new UTXO for the \"same\" contract.\n3.2. Deliverables\nIf possible, (a) a working contract as described above and (b) a corresponding transaction tweaking function, with (c) an example execution of the previous.\nIf the above is not possible due to current limitations of Plutus, we will deliver a set of proposed API modifications that would make the desired contract possible.\nWe estimate this step as taking about six weeks for one full-time developer, one quarter-time architect and one quarter-time manager, for a total budget of $45,000.00 including taxes and overhead. We believe we can deliver this proof of concept by August 2021.\n4. Future Steps for subsequent Catalyst Funds\nIf successful, this proposal is likely to lead to further work to turn the experiment into a product.\n4.1. Step 2: Proof of Concept for Malleability Support in Node\nThe second step will be to develop a change to the node software so it can correctly run the auction contract.\nDuring this step, we will likely identify changes to be made to the node software that will be required to properly take advantage of transaction malleability in the node. In this case, the deliverable shall be not the actual support for the auction contract, but a set of proposed API modifications that would make this support possible. We believe we could complete this within 3 months of beginning the project.\n4.2. Step 3: A Library for Open Contracts in Plutus\nThe third step will be to develop a general-purpose library for \"open\" contracts in Plutus.\nAssuming that any required changes to Plutus identified during step 1 were completed by the end of step 2, we should be able to start step 3 without a lull in development.\nThe deliverables will be (a) a general-purpose library for \"open\" contracts in Plutus, (b) a rewrite of the previous contract to use the library, (c) support for such open contracts in Glow. We believe we could complete this within 6-12 months from beginning the project.\n4.3. Step 4: A General Library for Open Contracts in the Node\nThe fourth and last step will be to develop a general-purpose library for malleable transactions in the node.\nAssuming that any required changes to the node APIs identified during step 2 were completed by the end of step 3, we should be able to start step 4 without a lull in development.\nThe deliverables will be general-purpose support in the node for taking advantage of malleable transactions from step 3. We believe this can be delivered in 9-18 months from the start of the project.\n5.

One of the most valuable primitives are pricing curves, used in Automatic Market Makers (AMM) that underpin many of the DEX, Loan, and Insurance protocols popular in DeFi.\n\nA general form of AMM is a Bonding-Curve[1].\n\nUsing a common set of economic protocols, DApps and DeFi protocols can easily integrate and interoperate. Defining common economic protocols as baseline primitives is similar to Ethereum's ERC notion of contract interface standards like ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and many others. Ethereum has APIs, Cardano has Protocols.\n\nThe proposal aims to design and engineer a module of baseline economic primitives for bonding curves—An open-source, reusable module in Plutus utilising the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) architecture. General enough to be used across many applications and reliably incorporated into more complex economic protocols.\n\nThere is a limited pool of experience implementing reliable DeFi protocols suitable for composition and even less experience using Plutus. Therefore to accelerate and scale up DeFi on Cardano, instead of developing a new or novel DeFi protocol wrapped in a DApp, we will take an existing well-researched and genuinely helpful set of baseline primitives explicitly designed for reuse and implement them using Plutus.\n\nA Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curve[2] (RABC) module is the motivating use-case for the lower-level design; Helping to inform the developer experience of the bonding curve module. These efforts combined, develop the necessary foundations for Alpha Bonds[3] (⍺Bonds) that motivate market context for the work.\n\nThe bonding curve module is not a DApp, although we understand how to take different bonding curve approaches to solve specific market needs such as decentralised micro-loan platforms or NFT art markets.\n\nWe are motivated to build tools that help finance impact, innovation, science, and culture. To do that, we need baseline economic protocols that can serve as building blocks on Cardano.\n\nFunding of this proposal will help accelerate that development.\n\nBackground\n\n⍺Bonds are a type of Social Impact Bond[4]. A performance-oriented multi-party contract and investment instrument suitable for funding projects with high uncertainty in outcomes (non-financial ROI). ⍺Bonds have been researched and developed as impact finance instruments, yet the design is applicable to anything new or innovative: social or environmental change, science, early-stage and seed-stage technology start-ups, internal corporate project budgeting, DAO coordination, community grants, art, and public good production.\n\nTo address many of the problems associated with typical Impact Bonds, the ⍺Bond protocol is built around an RABC. The RABC is a composite AMM for continuous investment. It is a complex economic protocol that aligns stakeholder incentives around a continuous market for project tokens minted and burnt on demand. They are a type of debt instrument with a conditional payout to investors. A payout tied to project success.\n\nInvestors can include any group inside and outside an organisational boundary. They are especially useful for decision making in Entrepreneurial Organisations and Ecosystem[5] Micro-Communities a.k.a DAOs.\n\nInvestors fund a project continuously by buying into a project token. Bonding to a project. They can also exit at any time. The price paid or received is determined by two curves (one for buying, another for selling). Also called minting and burning. At maturity, the bond reserve pays out to investors on project success. The outcome sponsor buys the result for a promised amount plus a coupon, eg. 10%, by depositing funds into the bond's reserve. Then the reserve pays out to investors. Holders of project tokens can withdraw their share of the reserve at any time after that. If the project fails, no outcome payment is received by the bond's reserve; hence investors only receive what remains in reserve.\n\nRABCs include an ability to adjust the buy and sell curves based on an external signal that estimates the probability of project success. In the primary design, that estimate is generated via an on-chain prediction market[6] where investors are able to stake their project tokens on success or failure, earning a higher yield on their initial investment. The prediction market is also based on bonding curves.\n\nThe protocol design incorporates many parameters to enable different contexts of use. Hence RABCs can be a building block to many other higher-order DeFi DApps, such IXO Hub's ⍺Bonds. Anything that involves financing projects with a high degree of uncertainty and complex outcomes occurring over potentially multiple stages can use RABCs. They act in a coordinating and curating manner to leverage capital and help with efficient capital allocation to performant projects.\n\nBonding Curves, the baseline primitive used in the RABC and therefore ⍺Bonds, bond a reserve token to a project-specific token. Through the specification of reserve ratio, exit fees, or price spread, the bonding of the reserve tokens can be used to finance project activity, implement the fair market allocation of project tokens, and provide market-based curation signals.\n\nExamples of Use\n\nEulerBeats [7]: (Bonding Curve) - A popular generative digital music art project incorporates a bonding curve for the buying and selling of Prints. Prints are tokens representing a type of fractional ownership for digital artworks. Buying a print generates cash flow for the Original (NFT) owner and funding for the underlying project.\n\nCommon Stack [8]: (Augmented bonding curve) - A pioneer in the application of augmented bonding curves to fund commons-based peer production. The bonding curve includes a hatch phase, a type of vesting functionality to ensure key project personnel have skin-in-the-game but are locked into the project for a specified period.\n\nProject Governance: Conviction Voting [9] & Commitment Voting[10] are variable time-weighted governance mechanisms. The weight of a vote is determined by the quantity and when a vote was cast, both use a bonding curve to weight votes. Conviction voting is a form of continuous voting where votes can be cast or withdrawn at any time. The Commons Stack continuously funds a Conviction Voting DAO that uses the mechanism to manage supply funds. Commitment voting locks winning votes into their decision beyond an election. Both mechanisms use lost opportunity (opportunity-cost) as their underlying incentive mechanism to reveal preferences.\n\nIXO Hub and ⍺Bonds: (Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curves) - Uses the RABC to help finance impact projects. The first test deployment of the RABC is focusing on education outcomes in Chimple India. Helping children attain literacy and numeracy. Outcome funders commit to purchasing the results of the project at cost plus a 10% coupon fee. Risk investors introduce operating capital by bonding reserve tokens. Service providers deliver the educational services for fees plus performance bonuses. Independent evaluators measure the educational outcomes. When learning targets are met this triggers repayment plus a coupon from the outcome funders. If outcomes are not achieved then no outcome payments are made and investors are allocated any remaining reserves.\n\nOther Uses: A Cardano based ⍺Bond implementation can be used as the basis for a decentralised Kiva, or a more scalable basis for Catalyst project funding that incorporates market incentives to monitor and audit funded projects.\n\nEnabling Stake-Pools to differentiate and be a source of outcome finance using ⍺Bonds to finance causes is also a possibility. Stake Pools can offer investment participation exclusively to delegates. Ensuring the bonding-curve design works well with Stake-Pools is an important success metric for this project. This helps to ensure network security is maintained when participating in any economic protocol based on our module.\n\nOrigin of Bonding Curves and RABC\n\nAMMs have been widely deployed in DeFi protocols since they were first demonstrated by Bancor, and Alan Lu of Gnosis, then popularised by Uniswap. Around the same time, Simon de la Rouviere started writing about Curation Markets that eventually became known as Bonding Curves- A generalisation of the pricing function and associated reserves found in AMMs where the protocol is able to mint and burn a token supply based on market demand. Ocean Protocol, Molecule, Clover Network, and the Common Stack in conjunction with Blockscience have researched and developed different aspects of the core idea and incorporated them into various protocols.\n\nThe Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curve design[2] was developed by Shruti Appiah [11] (IOG Senior Product Manager Engineering - on the Marlowe team) and the team at Blockscience for IXO Foundation. The design has been implemented on Comos as part of the Cosmos Bond Module [12] and the IXO Cosmos Blockchain implements ⍺Bonds.\n\nTeam & Experience\n\nThe team has experience in financial markets software engineering, cryptocurrency payments, tech start-ups, Data & Govtech, impact investing. We are also active in organising a legal-tech community.\n\nRobert O'Brien: Distributed Systems Software Engineer (Financial systems) and Entrepreneur. Co-Founded three start-ups in Financial Data Analytics, International Trade Payments, and Impact Investing. Co-Organises LegalHackers NZ, and advises a Social Entrepreneurship activation centre.\n\nAndrew Walker: Distributed systems software engineer, mostly in the financial sector in the City of London. Worked at Barclays Capital (credit risk) and LIFFE (derivatives exchange). Working on cryptocurrency payments infrastructure and also experienced with the hospitality sector.\n\nThe team has experience with using formal methods and developing high-performance systems in financial settings. Over the last twenty years, we've had functional programming experience in OCaml, Erlang, and Scala. We both have experience in Blockchains and crypto-currency projects and are part of the Plutus Pioneer Programme. We were also behind Fund2's \"A Smart Market Toolkit for Cardano.\" [13].\n\nWe are leveraging the work already done by Blockscience, the Token Engineering [14] community, Shruti Appiah, and IOG. As the project gets underway we will welcome other interested contributors from the community to help build and maintain the project.\n\nProposal impact on key metrics\n\nUnderlying DeFi is the idea of composition, the notion of money Lego or programmable money. Finance, in general, involves composing cash flows to gain leverage and adjust risk. When stacking, chaining, or using economic protocols together it is important that the whole exhibits predictable behaviour even with humans-in-the-loop. That isn't an easy task and certainly not a job that has to be repeated for every protocol or DApp.\n\nBy focusing on a baseline primitive and engineering it for reuse across the Cardano Ecosystem, we can make it faster to deploy reliable market-focused DApps. RABC demonstrates composition by combining four different bonding curves into one higher-level protocol for project financing. ⍺Bonds demonstrate the use of RABC in a market-focused DApp.\n\nThe bonding-curve module aims to be an essential toolkit for software developers that don't want to dive into learning Haskell, EUTXO, PlutusTx or the Plutus Application Backend. An essential toolkit for technology start-ups that don't have the skills in complexity-science and engineering talent to develop great economic protocols.\n\nBy using the primitives in the bonding curve module, DeFi Protocols and DApps can build and scale up faster. By using the primitives, Investors and Users gain confidence in the reliability of the protocols and DApps being used.\n\nDeliverables\n\nThe project will contribute to Cardano's DeFi ecosystem, a module of bonding curve primitives explicitly designed for integration into other higher-level protocols and DApps.\n\nAll source code will be licensed using an appropriate open-source license, e.g. MIT, and contributions must be contributed patent-free. Documentation will be licensed Creative-Commons CC-BY-SA. Code, documentation, project activity and Jupyter notebooks will be made available on Github.\n\nAll project repositories will be made public within one month of receiving funding and project activity will be public from that point onwards.\n\nThe project will evolve over time including the extension of bonding curves to bonding surfaces (see Balancer[15]) and the addition of new economic primitives. We are making a commitment to ensure there is long-term support that may eventually be managed and funded by a DAO (using bonding curves to fund and enable it!).\n\nThis proposal is to help bootstrap and accelerate that work, funding some of the initial efforts.\n\nSpecifically, with the initial project spanning six months, we aim to:\n\nDesign specifications translating the system design work of Bonding Curves and RABC into a set of EUTXO protocol designs.\nA Nix-based reproducible Jupyter Notebook toolkit for protocol engineering to help document and drive aspects of the testing and simulation work.\nDevelopment of testing and simulations for the specifications and implementation.\nThe Plutus and Plutus TX code implementing bonding curves and prototype RABC.\nCommand-Line tools to define, simulate, test and deploy different bonding curve configurations to testnets or mainnet. Enabling interaction with deployed instances.\n\nMaking economic protocols reusable involves a lot more work than if they were just baked into a specific product. It requires modular components but also formal analysis, design and engineering to ensure the implementations behave as expected when combined with other primitives. Ideally, the digital twins of the economic protocols and their specifications can be reused too. Informing the construction of higher-level protocols.\n\nMaking something reusable involves more than just engineering and software development; tooling, extensive testing, independent security audits, good documentation, supporting guides, and community involvement are all important.\n\nWe may seek further funding from Catalyst for other aspects of the work including:\n\nHigh-Quality documentation (including videos) to both explain the design and socialise it.\nDeeper engagement with the community and other projects.\nTaking the RABC implementation up to production-grade.\nDevelop mechanised proofs, perform property-based testing, and undertake security audits of the core bonding-curve primitives.\nDesign and develop front-end components for DAO and ⍺Bonds functionality.\nSetup of an associated DAO to drive ongoing development, maintenance and support.\n\nWe are using, as a reference, the Cosmos Bond Module[12] and IXO ⍺Bonds[16] implementations. Work will be scheduled with a regular cadence of two weeks over six months.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nKey Metric: Project Velocity [17], defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits pulled from Github.\n\nActivity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence of deliverables and engineering milestones achieved.\n\nCommunity Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories [18] for the Bond Module, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem. These Metrics derive mostly from Github.\n\nDefinitions of Success\n\nThree Months: Project setup and initial specifications for bonding curve module and the overall design, along with initial simulations and implementation of the core protocols running on the Plutus Dev nets.\n\nSix Months: Production-ready core protocols engineered and usable on mainnet. Prototype development of RABC. Engagement with individuals interested in contributing and developing different protocols and entering a trusted seed phase for the associated DAO. Documentation to both explains the design and use of the bonding curve primitives.\n\nTwelve Months: RABC implemented. Five projects use the bonding-curve module in their implementation; A mix of DeFi protocols, DApps, and DAO. At least one is an impact finance platform such as IXO ie. They integrate our RABC implementation into IXO Hub and one Stake Pool funds a ⍺Bond. DAO established.\n\nBudget Breakdown\n\nTotal Ask: $45K USD funding 0.5 FTE over six months to bootstrap and accelerate development. Budget based on a pro-rata hourly rate spread over up to three team members. The budget assumes an FTE hourly rate of USD$100 that includes all overheads.
